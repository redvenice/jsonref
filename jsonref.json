She says the internet is invaluable for household items, books and presents. \u0027Everything is there in one place. However, I\u0027d never buy clothes online — you can\u0027t try them on.\u00278.49amAnne identifies on Amazon an Aberg Best 21 megapixels camera, which can be delivered the same day. She\u0027s impressed by the price — £38 — and as a Prime customer there\u0027s no delivery fee. She clicks and buys.8.49am, MAN1, Altrincham, Gtr ManchesterSixty-five miles away from Anne\u0027s home in Garforth is MAN1, one of Amazon\u0027s 17 giant UK warehouses, or \u0027fulfilment centres\u0027 as the company calls them. Each is named after the nearest airport. MAN1 is a few hundred yards from Manchester Airport.General manager Neil Travis, 51, says being near the M56 and M6 means they are close to a large percentage of customers and allows them \u0027to do same day, next-day delivery\u0027.The warehouse is 780ft long, has nearly a million square feet of floor space arranged across four floors and holds \u0027many millions\u0027 of products.Neil says it is \u0027a matter of seconds\u0027 between Anne clicking and MAN1 receiving the order. \u0027When you click \u0027buy it now\u0027, the system will see which of the 17 buildings in the UK has that item in stock,\u0027 he adds. \u0027And it works out where the customer is located.\u0027The system then determines the quickest route to get the product out to the customer.\u0027The computer that controls the \u0027system\u0027 is \u0027in a cloud\u0027,\u0027 he says, referring to the nickname for where data is stored on remote servers.Explaining how products get from the warehouse to our door, he adds: \u0027Everything works backwards from the customer\u0027s home.\u0027It must leave MAN1 by 2pm, be packed by 1pm and selected for the start of this process by 12pm. \u0027It calculates it all the way backwards.\u00278.50am, MAN1The camera is located in the middle of the warehouse on the second floor — in a \u0027pod\u0027, Amazon\u0027s word for a four-sided fabric storage unit. There are more than 10,000 pods closely packed together.Each is 8ft tall and 2ft 6in wide. They have cubby holes on each side — storing, for instance, a Beast Gear self-moulding mouthguard, a Will Smith CD, two Katy Perry CDs and a plug-in pest repellent. \u0027Everything is randomly stored across all the floors,\u0027 says Neil. This allows staff to access separate pods if there is a sudden rush of orders for one product rather than all having to queue by one pod.10.29am          Ann Doughty\u0027s order is received at the Amazon Fulfilment centre in Manchester where a robot locates her camera  in a yellow \u0027pod\u0027 and bring to \u0027picker\u0027 staffA robot called No. 53721, one of 2,000 in MAN1, collects the pod containing the camera. The robots outnumber the human staff by 800 they are about the size of a large electric lawnmower and cost more than £10,000 each.They move like rooks on a chess board — going east to west or north to south. They can\u0027t go diagonally, but can spin around to move direction by 90 degrees.The robot whizzes under the pods until it finds the right one. A hydraulic lift in the top of the robot is released, which raises the pod an inch. It then carries the pod towards the edge of the floor.The robots are continually lifting up pods and putting them down. \u0027It\u0027s quite therapeutic just watching them move about,\u0027 says Neil.10.31am          Orders are scanned and labelled with the delivery address at this machineFurther down the conveyor, the parcel moves under another barcode scanner. The conveyor belt briefly pauses while a sticky address label for \u0027Mrs Anne Doughty\u0027 is printed and stuck onto the parcel.It flies down a chute to the floor below, then the ground floor.10.44amIt\u0027s still less than two hours since Anne clicked \u0027buy\u0027. The camera, having travelled along a fair chunk of the eight miles of conveyor belts, is (after another barcode scan) sent down a side-chute into a huge open-topped, 6ft-high cardboard box, called a \u0027gaylord\u0027. (They were first created by the Gaylord Container Corporation in the U.S.)Underneath the conveyor belt side-chutes, about 90 different gaylords are lined up, each one designated to a particular area of the country.Anne\u0027s camera is sent into a gaylord destined for DLS2, an Amazon \u0027delivery station\u0027 in Leeds, along with 181 other items.2.17pmThe camera has been sitting in the DLS2 gaylord for a short time. But at every stage, its barcode has been scanned to ensure it\u0027s on time and going to the right place.It is now loaded onto the back of an HGV lorry with other gaylords and leaves MAN1.The business rates bill Amazon had to pay last year for this vast warehouse outside Manchester was £919,370, according to the real estate adviser, Altus Group. This is less than £1.42 million that the financially troubled House of Fraser paid on its department store in the centre of the city.\u0027Is Amazon a good corporate citizen?\u0027 I ask general manager Neil. He replies: \u0027In an area that had reasonably high unemployment, we\u0027ve offered over 1,000 permanent positions to people in the local community, offering a lot of economic prosperity as a result of that.\u00273.52pmThe lorry arrives at DLS2, the Amazon delivery station near junction 45 of the M1, on the outskirts of Leeds. A far smaller building than the Manchester fulfilment centre, it is one storey high and about 240ft long. The gaylord is unloaded from the HGV.4.07pm          Operations associate Hassan Khan sorts parcels into delivery districts for delivery drivers at the Leeds based delivery station, West YorkshireAmazon has 38 different UK delivery stations, which act as sorting offices. Until 2012, products were collected by firms such as Hermes, Yodel and DHL, which sorted and delivered them.However, Amazon took greater control of this process after it started offering same-day and Sunday deliveries.The Leeds base opened in 2016 and employs 40 full-time employees. They sort the parcels into postcodes for areas from Huddersfield to Scarborough.Because Anne\u0027s camera is a same-day delivery, operations associate Hassan Khan sorts it into a yellow cage full of parcels being delivered this evening.4.58pmMornings tend to be busiest at Leeds. That\u0027s when one-day deliveries get sent out. Same-day deliveries — a far smaller proportion of Amazon orders — are picked up at about 5pm. Outside the delivery station, a trickle of cars and white vans arrive for the evening pick-ups.Amazon uses a network of courier companies, as well as a newer service called Flex, which is similar to online taxi service Uber.Anyone with a car and a smartphone can sign up to be an Amazon Flex driver, earning £12 to £15 an hour — though they pay for their own car, petrol and insurance.Cars — I can see a Seat Leon, a Vauxhall Astra, a Mercedes C2, a Nissan Note and a Citroen C4 — line up in rows.The Flex drivers, men aged 20 to 45, most speaking broken English, arrive in the warehouse and use their phone to scan a quick response code on a warehouse computer terminal. They are given a cage, with about 25 to 30 parcels, to wheel out to their cars.5.07pm          Alex Rabone,28, delivers Mrs Doughtys order to her home in Garforth, West YorkshireAnne\u0027s cul-de-sac is Alex\u0027s first stop. \u0027I like delivering around here,\u0027 he says. \u0027The best areas are high-density, suburban — all the front doors on the ground floor. Lovely.\u0027He rings Anne\u0027s doorbell. She answers and is handed her parcel — less than nine hours after she first pressed \u0027Buy Now\u0027.5.41pmAnne opens the package in her kitchen and is impressed at how lightweight and \u0027dinky\u0027 the camera is. \u0027I do worry about the High Street, but Amazon is so useful,\u0027 she says. And cheap.Her nearest electronics store is Currys PC World in Pontefract, 20 minutes away. Its cheapest digital camera is £69, compared with her £38 model from Amazon.One thing is certain, however. With robots helping Amazon to ship parcels within nine hours of them being ordered, the millions that we spend online every week are only going to increase. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/10/07/4EFB16CA00000578-0-image-a-70_1533883783858.jpg","title":"State Isa payouts slashed just weeks Bank England hiked rates","story":"    Phillip Hammond (right) was last night accused of abandoning savers as the Government\u0027s savings arm prepares to slash the pay out on its best IsaA decade ago its top Isa paid 5.8 per cent – £696. Experts have criticised NS\u0026ampI, which raises money for the Treasury and also administers premium bonds, for failing savers who have suffered a decade of poor returns. They are calling on chancellor Philip Hammond to throw more funding at NS\u0026ampI. The Mail has already revealed how major banks have failed to pass on the full 0.25 percentage point base rate rise to savers, despite being quick to hike mortgage bills.Savers sold down the river yet again: Banks are FAILING to...Share this articleExperts warn that if NS\u0026ampI cuts its rates there will be even less incentive for banks and building societies to give savers a boost.Conservative MP Simon Clarke, who sits on the Treasury select committee, said: \u0027NS\u0026ampI are one of the key benchmarks for savers – it is hugely disappointing they are cutting rates at the time savers have been promised greater rewards.\u0027Steve Webb, former pensions minister and director of policy at Royal London, said: \u0027Savers have been taking a hammering for a decade and it would be truly extraordinary if NS\u0026ampI cut their savings rates when others are starting to increase theirs.\u0027          Experts are calling on  chancellor Philip Hammond (right) to throw more funding at NS\u0026ampINS\u0026ampI accounts are popular because savers\u0027 cash is fully protected by the Government. At banks, only £85,000 is guaranteed under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if a firm fails.Each year the Government sets NS\u0026ampI a fundraising target, which it must not exceed. For this tax year – between April 1 and March 31 – the target is just £6billion (plus or minus £3billion each side). This is its lowest limit for five years, down from £8billion in the previous tax year. When the target is low NS\u0026ampI must avoid attracting too much cash so it does not overshoot it. This typically means offering lower rates or introducing stricter limits on how much people can invest.In June, NS\u0026ampI came under fire for slashing the amount new savers can invest in its Guaranteed Growth or Guaranteed Income Bonds from £1 million to just £10,000. Experts said if the Government increases NS\u0026ampI\u0027s target to nearer £20billion it would be forced to boost its rates to attract more savers\u0027 money.           The Bank of England (pictured) hiked rates, but the National Savings \u0026amp Investment (NS\u0026ampI) is poised to cut its easy-access Direct Isa rate from 1 per cent to 0.75 per cent on September 24 anywayAnd when NS\u0026ampI increases its rates, other banks and building societies often follow with more competitive deals of their own.Ros Altmann, former pensions minister and campaigner for older people, said: \u0027It seems unfair on savers that the safest savings accounts, backed by the Treasury, are cutting interest rates at the time the Bank of England has increased base rate.\u0027An NS\u0026ampI spokesman said: \u0027NS\u0026ampI sets its interest rates to balance the interests of its savers, taxpayers and the stability of the broader financial services sector.\u0027 A Treasury spokesman said: \u0027When setting the rates of NS\u0026ampI products, it\u0027s important we get the best possible value for taxpayers, while still offering a competitive rate for savers.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/17/10/4F2554BD00000578-0-North_Korea_s_Kim_Jong_Un_looks_cheerful_and_holds_a_cigarette_a-a-4_1534497593742.jpg","title":"North Korean leader sets vision tourist paradise","story":"    The hermit kingdom\u0027s dictator Kim Jong-Un speaks to officials as he inspects the constrution of the Wonsan-Karma site           North Korea\u0027s Kim Jong-Un looks cheerful and holds a cigarette as he visits a hot spring district in South Pyongan province           Kim speaks to the officials on the beach which he is intent on turning into a luxury resort in North Korea Emergency services seen at the scene on Hythe beach, KentMetropolitan Police work on the scene of stabbings in CamberwellChris Watts makes appeal over missing family before his arrestShanann\u0027s daughter sings about her father, and calls him \u0027her hero\u0027Controversial American pastor bitten by a deadly snakeCCTV helps teacher identify burglar as her own neighbourIranian woman removes hijab in front of cleric who threatened herItalian firefighters remove green truck from collapsed Genoa bridgeStudent opens A-Level results on TV and it didn\u0027t go to planShanann Watts surprises husband Chris with pregnancy before deathIt is scheduled to be completed by October 10, an important public holiday in the country which marks the founding of a precursor to the ruling Workers\u0027 Party of Korea. Kim wants to rebuild Wonsan by demolishing its centre and replacing it with five-star skyscraper hotels and department stores for his elite.Murder trial against two women accused of smearing VX nerve...Kim udders his demands!

I\u0027ve had friends come by who are really concerned.\u0027He admitted he had rounded up from $419 to set the possible price, offering an approximate 20 per cent premium over the market value, but said: \u0027Weed is not helpful for productivity. There’s a reason for the word ‘stoned.’ You just sit there like a stone on weed.\u0027 Describing his \u0027most painful year\u0027 Musk said he had nearly missed his brother Kimbal Musk\u0027s lavish wedding to environmental activist Christiana Wyly in Spain.Kimbal officially married Christiana, the daughter of billionaire Sam Wyly, on April 7, but celebrated the event with around 300 guests at Greco-Roman ruins near Girona. Elon Musk is estranged from his and Kimbal\u0027s father Errol, after he had a baby with his own stepdaughter - a woman who is 42 years his junior. Musk branded the 72-year-old \u0027evil\u0027 and \u0027a terrible human being\u0027 saying his father had done \u0027almost every evil thing you can possibly think of\u0027.          Elon Musk said he had nearly missed the wedding of his brother Kimbal (pictured in Spain)Musk\u0027s latest troubles began when he tweeted on August 7 to say: \u0027Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\u0027He said he wrote the tweet on the way to airport, saying: \u0027It seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419. But I was not on weed, to be clear.\u0027 He admitted no one had seen the post in advance. The sudden announcement sent Tesla\u0027s share price rocketing by 11 per cent in one day, leading officials to ask if he had violated securities law by misleading investors about the funding. The federal securities watchdog has sent Tesla subpoenas which typically indicates that it has opened a full formal investigation into a matter.The company did not comment on that report, but it did say it was forming a special committee to evaluate proposals to take the company private.  On Monday, lawyers said Musk\u0027s statement indicated he had good reason to believe he had funding but seemed to have overstated its status by saying it was secured.  In a separate report, The Wall Street Journal said securities regulators have been investigating if Tesla misled investors about production problems for its Model 3 car.

She says the internet is invaluable for household items, books and presents. \u0027Everything is there in one place. However, I\u0027d never buy clothes online — you can\u0027t try them on.\u00278.49amAnne identifies on Amazon an Aberg Best 21 megapixels camera, which can be delivered the same day. She\u0027s impressed by the price — £38 — and as a Prime customer there\u0027s no delivery fee. She clicks and buys.8.49am, MAN1, Altrincham, Gtr ManchesterSixty-five miles away from Anne\u0027s home in Garforth is MAN1, one of Amazon\u0027s 17 giant UK warehouses, or \u0027fulfilment centres\u0027 as the company calls them. Each is named after the nearest airport. MAN1 is a few hundred yards from Manchester Airport.General manager Neil Travis, 51, says being near the M56 and M6 means they are close to a large percentage of customers and allows them \u0027to do same day, next-day delivery\u0027.The warehouse is 780ft long, has nearly a million square feet of floor space arranged across four floors and holds \u0027many millions\u0027 of products.Neil says it is \u0027a matter of seconds\u0027 between Anne clicking and MAN1 receiving the order. \u0027When you click \u0027buy it now\u0027, the system will see which of the 17 buildings in the UK has that item in stock,\u0027 he adds. \u0027And it works out where the customer is located.\u0027The system then determines the quickest route to get the product out to the customer.\u0027The computer that controls the \u0027system\u0027 is \u0027in a cloud\u0027,\u0027 he says, referring to the nickname for where data is stored on remote servers.Explaining how products get from the warehouse to our door, he adds: \u0027Everything works backwards from the customer\u0027s home.\u0027It must leave MAN1 by 2pm, be packed by 1pm and selected for the start of this process by 12pm. \u0027It calculates it all the way backwards.\u00278.50am, MAN1The camera is located in the middle of the warehouse on the second floor — in a \u0027pod\u0027, Amazon\u0027s word for a four-sided fabric storage unit. There are more than 10,000 pods closely packed together.Each is 8ft tall and 2ft 6in wide. They have cubby holes on each side — storing, for instance, a Beast Gear self-moulding mouthguard, a Will Smith CD, two Katy Perry CDs and a plug-in pest repellent. \u0027Everything is randomly stored across all the floors,\u0027 says Neil. This allows staff to access separate pods if there is a sudden rush of orders for one product rather than all having to queue by one pod.10.29am          Ann Doughty\u0027s order is received at the Amazon Fulfilment centre in Manchester where a robot locates her camera  in a yellow \u0027pod\u0027 and bring to \u0027picker\u0027 staffA robot called No. 53721, one of 2,000 in MAN1, collects the pod containing the camera. The robots outnumber the human staff by 800 they are about the size of a large electric lawnmower and cost more than £10,000 each.They move like rooks on a chess board — going east to west or north to south. They can\u0027t go diagonally, but can spin around to move direction by 90 degrees.The robot whizzes under the pods until it finds the right one. A hydraulic lift in the top of the robot is released, which raises the pod an inch. It then carries the pod towards the edge of the floor.The robots are continually lifting up pods and putting them down. \u0027It\u0027s quite therapeutic just watching them move about,\u0027 says Neil.10.31am          Orders are scanned and labelled with the delivery address at this machineFurther down the conveyor, the parcel moves under another barcode scanner. The conveyor belt briefly pauses while a sticky address label for \u0027Mrs Anne Doughty\u0027 is printed and stuck onto the parcel.It flies down a chute to the floor below, then the ground floor.10.44amIt\u0027s still less than two hours since Anne clicked \u0027buy\u0027. The camera, having travelled along a fair chunk of the eight miles of conveyor belts, is (after another barcode scan) sent down a side-chute into a huge open-topped, 6ft-high cardboard box, called a \u0027gaylord\u0027. (They were first created by the Gaylord Container Corporation in the U.S.)Underneath the conveyor belt side-chutes, about 90 different gaylords are lined up, each one designated to a particular area of the country.Anne\u0027s camera is sent into a gaylord destined for DLS2, an Amazon \u0027delivery station\u0027 in Leeds, along with 181 other items.2.17pmThe camera has been sitting in the DLS2 gaylord for a short time. But at every stage, its barcode has been scanned to ensure it\u0027s on time and going to the right place.It is now loaded onto the back of an HGV lorry with other gaylords and leaves MAN1.The business rates bill Amazon had to pay last year for this vast warehouse outside Manchester was £919,370, according to the real estate adviser, Altus Group. This is less than £1.42 million that the financially troubled House of Fraser paid on its department store in the centre of the city.\u0027Is Amazon a good corporate citizen?\u0027 I ask general manager Neil. He replies: \u0027In an area that had reasonably high unemployment, we\u0027ve offered over 1,000 permanent positions to people in the local community, offering a lot of economic prosperity as a result of that.\u00273.52pmThe lorry arrives at DLS2, the Amazon delivery station near junction 45 of the M1, on the outskirts of Leeds. A far smaller building than the Manchester fulfilment centre, it is one storey high and about 240ft long. The gaylord is unloaded from the HGV.4.07pm          Operations associate Hassan Khan sorts parcels into delivery districts for delivery drivers at the Leeds based delivery station, West YorkshireAmazon has 38 different UK delivery stations, which act as sorting offices. Until 2012, products were collected by firms such as Hermes, Yodel and DHL, which sorted and delivered them.However, Amazon took greater control of this process after it started offering same-day and Sunday deliveries.The Leeds base opened in 2016 and employs 40 full-time employees. They sort the parcels into postcodes for areas from Huddersfield to Scarborough.Because Anne\u0027s camera is a same-day delivery, operations associate Hassan Khan sorts it into a yellow cage full of parcels being delivered this evening.4.58pmMornings tend to be busiest at Leeds. That\u0027s when one-day deliveries get sent out. Same-day deliveries — a far smaller proportion of Amazon orders — are picked up at about 5pm. Outside the delivery station, a trickle of cars and white vans arrive for the evening pick-ups.Amazon uses a network of courier companies, as well as a newer service called Flex, which is similar to online taxi service Uber.Anyone with a car and a smartphone can sign up to be an Amazon Flex driver, earning £12 to £15 an hour — though they pay for their own car, petrol and insurance.Cars — I can see a Seat Leon, a Vauxhall Astra, a Mercedes C2, a Nissan Note and a Citroen C4 — line up in rows.The Flex drivers, men aged 20 to 45, most speaking broken English, arrive in the warehouse and use their phone to scan a quick response code on a warehouse computer terminal. They are given a cage, with about 25 to 30 parcels, to wheel out to their cars.5.07pm          Alex Rabone,28, delivers Mrs Doughtys order to her home in Garforth, West YorkshireAnne\u0027s cul-de-sac is Alex\u0027s first stop. \u0027I like delivering around here,\u0027 he says. \u0027The best areas are high-density, suburban — all the front doors on the ground floor. Lovely.\u0027He rings Anne\u0027s doorbell. She answers and is handed her parcel — less than nine hours after she first pressed \u0027Buy Now\u0027.5.41pmAnne opens the package in her kitchen and is impressed at how lightweight and \u0027dinky\u0027 the camera is. \u0027I do worry about the High Street, but Amazon is so useful,\u0027 she says. And cheap.Her nearest electronics store is Currys PC World in Pontefract, 20 minutes away. Its cheapest digital camera is £69, compared with her £38 model from Amazon.One thing is certain, however. With robots helping Amazon to ship parcels within nine hours of them being ordered, the millions that we spend online every week are only going to increase. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/10/07/4EFB16CA00000578-0-image-a-70_1533883783858.jpg","title":"State Isa payouts slashed just weeks Bank England hiked rates","story":"    Phillip Hammond (right) was last night accused of abandoning savers as the Government\u0027s savings arm prepares to slash the pay out on its best IsaA decade ago its top Isa paid 5.8 per cent – £696. Experts have criticised NS\u0026ampI, which raises money for the Treasury and also administers premium bonds, for failing savers who have suffered a decade of poor returns. They are calling on chancellor Philip Hammond to throw more funding at NS\u0026ampI. The Mail has already revealed how major banks have failed to pass on the full 0.25 percentage point base rate rise to savers, despite being quick to hike mortgage bills.Savers sold down the river yet again: Banks are FAILING to...Share this articleExperts warn that if NS\u0026ampI cuts its rates there will be even less incentive for banks and building societies to give savers a boost.Conservative MP Simon Clarke, who sits on the Treasury select committee, said: \u0027NS\u0026ampI are one of the key benchmarks for savers – it is hugely disappointing they are cutting rates at the time savers have been promised greater rewards.\u0027Steve Webb, former pensions minister and director of policy at Royal London, said: \u0027Savers have been taking a hammering for a decade and it would be truly extraordinary if NS\u0026ampI cut their savings rates when others are starting to increase theirs.\u0027          Experts are calling on  chancellor Philip Hammond (right) to throw more funding at NS\u0026ampINS\u0026ampI accounts are popular because savers\u0027 cash is fully protected by the Government. At banks, only £85,000 is guaranteed under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if a firm fails.Each year the Government sets NS\u0026ampI a fundraising target, which it must not exceed. For this tax year – between April 1 and March 31 – the target is just £6billion (plus or minus £3billion each side). This is its lowest limit for five years, down from £8billion in the previous tax year. When the target is low NS\u0026ampI must avoid attracting too much cash so it does not overshoot it. This typically means offering lower rates or introducing stricter limits on how much people can invest.In June, NS\u0026ampI came under fire for slashing the amount new savers can invest in its Guaranteed Growth or Guaranteed Income Bonds from £1 million to just £10,000. Experts said if the Government increases NS\u0026ampI\u0027s target to nearer £20billion it would be forced to boost its rates to attract more savers\u0027 money.           The Bank of England (pictured) hiked rates, but the National Savings \u0026amp Investment (NS\u0026ampI) is poised to cut its easy-access Direct Isa rate from 1 per cent to 0.75 per cent on September 24 anywayAnd when NS\u0026ampI increases its rates, other banks and building societies often follow with more competitive deals of their own.Ros Altmann, former pensions minister and campaigner for older people, said: \u0027It seems unfair on savers that the safest savings accounts, backed by the Treasury, are cutting interest rates at the time the Bank of England has increased base rate.\u0027An NS\u0026ampI spokesman said: \u0027NS\u0026ampI sets its interest rates to balance the interests of its savers, taxpayers and the stability of the broader financial services sector.\u0027 A Treasury spokesman said: \u0027When setting the rates of NS\u0026ampI products, it\u0027s important we get the best possible value for taxpayers, while still offering a competitive rate for savers.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b44e08f0802cf4f6cba91888eda4382ecd9faaa/0_345_5201_3122/master/5201.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a210ea9478474feca8b7396f27fa69d","title":"australian geographic nature photographer of the year in pictures","story":"Professional, emerging and junior photographers have entered the 2018 competition with more than 100 photographs showcasing the natural wonder of Australia, New Zealand, Antarctica and New Guinea bioregions.

The vehicle, already overloaded with passengers, was caught in gridlocked traffic and sat static for nearly an hour. There was a heatwave, with a temperature of about 38C (100F) outside inside the bus it was 42C (108F). “At a specific moment, I just snapped,” remembered Ayari. “I got out in the middle of traffic to finally breathe.” Since then, he has been inclined to panic attacks if in confined, crowded spaces during hot weather.A month earlier, approximately 2,000 km (1300 miles) away in Bristol, UK, Adam Corner was on a bus with his partner and their new baby, heading across the city to visit friends. The bus was held up in traffic – not for long, but long enough. “It became a kind of inferno,” said Dr Corner, research director at Climate Outreach their baby, barely a month old, started screaming in a way Corner had never heard before. “We had a little insight into this immediate, visceral risk – you see it through the eyes of your newborn child.” He pulled the bus’s emergency cord and they jumped off into traffic.This tale of two bus journeys tells a story of rising temperatures and the pressure they are putting on cities and the people who live in them. Asked by  Cities to share their experiences for a week-long series on urban heat, readers from countries as disparate as Hawaii, the Netherlands, Australia, Denmark, Japan, France, Malaysia, Romania, South Korea and Canada expressed concern about the impacts already being felt.“When I moved here many years ago, we used to joke: ‘This summer happened on a Wednesday in Paris’,” wrote Mariann Gyorke. “That’s not the case anymore.” In an effort to preserve the cooler temperatures inside her family’s top-floor apartment, she had been cooking only cold dishes and shielding the windows with makeshift shutters made of cardboard.Around the world, people altered their behaviour and adapted their schedules to cope with the heatwave. In order to sleep, Michele Howie of Sydney soaked her nightwear in water and lay on a towel in front of two fans. Anna Mastersson in Mariehamn, of Finland’s Åland Islands, said her relative had been forced to buy a new car with air conditioning and a roof window: “In this weather and having to drive two small kids, she had no choice.” In her neighbourhood, dogs were being taken out later at night, for shorter walks. In Montreal, Frederic Hore had noticed people lingering in pedestrian passageways of the metro station to catch the pulse of cool air created by passing trains.Outside, green spaces dried up, with follow-on effects for agriculture and often the economy. Inge Kersten wrote of Nijmegen, this year’s European Green Capital, “Leaves are falling in our lovely green city”. On her family’s organic farm near Aarhus, Denmark, Jessica Tamminga had watched fields turn from green to brown: “The trees are turning yellow like it’s fall”. But for the impact on her business, she said, the heat was “rather pleasant – except for the disconcerting feeling that this California summer doesn’t belong in Scandinavia.”Britons, in particular, seemed more ready to take the warmer temperatures at face value. “We’re all enjoying a real summer at last,” wrote Regan Armitage. “Everyone seems uncharacteristically happy in Leeds.” Frank Holt in Brighton described the summer as “luxuriating, joyful, a little alcoholic, a summer you don’t need to go away for”. “It’s wonderful not moaning about the weather,” he wrote, adding that the ’s call-out had seem “designed to gain negative replies”.Holt expanded to  Cities by phone that, though he was concerned by climbing temperatures, he felt the onus was on scientists and the media to persuade politicians to act, he said in the meantime, the warmer weather “did have some enjoyable aspects”. “I think things sometimes should be enjoyed for what they are. This summer has been very good for Brighton.”And not all life was suffering in the heat. Jellyfish numbers had increased in the tropical seas around Jeju Island, wrote In-Gyum Kim from Seogwipo, its second-largest city. Helena in Columbia, South Carolina, said that judgin gby how often she was bitten, ticks and mosquitoes seemed to be thriving, as were “our famous Palmetto bugs” – cockroaches. In Kuala Lumpur, a bumper crop of the prized durian fruit saw prices come down to RM5 (£1) per kilo – but that had its own, unusual effect.The fruit is understood to raise the body’s temperature, said Vanessa Ting, a student in the Malaysian capital. “I ate three pieces and spent the rest of the day sweaty and uncomfortable, despite taking six showers.” At the pharmacy where she works part time, more customers had been reporting fevers, sore throats and coughs, attributed variously to the weather and durian. And she’d observed more retirees opting to meet at the McDonald’s where she regularly studied, rather than in more traditional coffee shops without air conditioning.  Cody Winchester had noticed more air conditioners being installed on more buildings in Honolulu. “People used to just open their windows and the fresh tropical breeze would pass through and cool the home. Now it’s unbearable to live in town without AC.” But many could not afford it, he added, as Hawaii has the most expensive electricity in the entire US.Many found their homes simply not built to cope with extreme temperatures. Adina wrote of Timisoara, Romania, that given its reliance on concrete and tarmac “the city becomes a frying pan in the heat”. Clive Warner, in Monterrey in northern Mexico, was opting to move 25km south to Santiago, Nuevo Leon, a greener area that is, on average, 5C cooler. “Having cardiac problems, I can’t tolerate it any longer,” he said of the 34-37C (93-99F) maximum shade temperature in Monterrey. “If it gets much hotter I don’t see how the place will be survivable in summer.”The electricity already sometimes fails in 39C (102F) heat, he added. “If that happens, I get in the car and drive to a shopping mall.”Air conditioning brought relief, but to a point that seemed drastically, even dangerously, at odds with ecology, said Tim Kelly in Naha, Japan. “Stores leave their front doors wide open, people enter and exit rooms without closing the door behind them – all the while blasting their air conditioning.” People even napped in their parked cars with the engines running.Not only was this dependance on air conditioning damaging to the environment, but moving regularly between radically different climes causes temperature shock, said Kelly. “Their bodies lose the ability to cope with the natural environment.” Johanna MacGregor said summer colds were common in Tokyo because shops, restaurants and the subway were often too cool, “while places like schools or community halls often have no aircon whatsoever – it’s one or the other.”It was in stark contrast to the picture painted by Patrycja Lickiewicz of Castalla in Alicante, Spain, as a society “in tacit compliance with nature”. There it is the norm to restrict activities to before 8.30am and after 8pm and to drink water, dress appropriately, and stick to the shade at all other hours. “No matter the temperatures people always behave the same way,” said Lickiewicz. “We do not complain, we just follow the same simple routines. When common sense prevails we keep ourselves and the environment in check.”But adapting is not simply a case of being sun-smart, Lickiewicz conceded, when at least the oldest buildings in Castalla are built of stone, with internal air flow directed through courtyards and shutters – which manages heat without the need for air conditioning.If cities are to cope with more extreme heat more frequently, there needs to be structural change across the board: building codes to ensure future housing stock is not only warm, but cool infrastructure that can cope and regulation to enforce safe behaviours. Harry May, in Fukuoka, Japan, wanted to see work shut down when the mercury climbs past 34C (“Think on that, the UK”) Monica Garcia-Galvan was in favour of introducing a water tax in Montreal to encourage people not to let taps run for minutes at a time (“if English people saw how Canadians wash dishes, they would faint”). Adina, in Timisoara, Romania, said authorities needed to enforce health and safety laws relating to working in unsafe temperatures: “We have them but no one respects them.” Alice Browning of Friedrichshafen, southern Germany, spoke for many with her desperate plea for more trees: “We really don’t want to be cooped up inside all day.”In many cities steps have already been taken. In Nantes, Patrick Brown said, boulevards cleared for cars were being redesigned to include plenty of green space, and art installations with water features had given people places in which to cool off in summer. The De Bastei centre operated a scheme in Nijmegen and elsewhere in the Netherlands where residents could swap tiles or stones from their garden for plants.Others saw opportunities to be grasped by tackling the rising temperatures. David Fraire said nothing could be done to ease the issue of heat in Chandler, Arizona. “This is Phoenix, valley of the sun – it comes with the territory.” But it could be better harnessed: “We should be using this heat to our advantage and convert all our power to solar source.” Frank Holt suggested that Britain could build its new, post-Brexit identity through investment in renewables.But even in amongst optimism there was a feeling of powerlessness, even fatalism. Washington DC residents would cope with the heat as they had done for decades, said Cara – but related issues, for example surrounding health problems and food insecurity, were a bigger unknown. “We’re already putting in more green, solar, or light-coloured roofs. We’re committed to keeping and increasing the tree canopy, too, to help lower temperatures.”But without greater commitment to addressing the root causes from regional authorities – for example, by shutting down the coal-fired power plants along the Potomac – Cara continued: “there is very little we can do”. Charlie in Redding, California, urged that the US “stop with the knuckle dragging” and return to the Paris climate accord and “thinking people” at once – if it was not already too late. The day he wrote, it was nearly 43C (109F): “Think that life as we have known it forever is on a collision course with a destiny that’s not beneficial for mankind!”Dr Adam Corner of Climate Outreach said adapting to climate change meant seeing its influence in every facet of life – not just the environment, and not just in high-profile periods of extreme weather. “It’s a really complex set of questions, but those tangible things are more relatable to people than ‘global temperatures are going to change by 2C’,” he said. “There are so many ways that climate change is with us now. It’s very much not a problem for the next generation – we need to be thinking about how we get to grips with it.”The effects and implications of rising temperatures need to be considered by doctors, urban planners, architects those working in business, transport, agriculture and food security. Yet even news stories about climate change were illustrated with photographs of polar bears and melting ice caps, or renderings of future cities. “It’s the human story of our generation, but you wouldn’t know it, from the way we visualise and present it. Where are the people in this?”In Nabeul, said Ayari, they were mostly indoors, sheltering in the air conditioning. Traffic had become unbearable and it was too hot even to go to the beach. His twin sister has a respiratory condition exacerbated by the heat and had been advised to stay indoors: “The doctors say it’s like an allergy to the weather,” said Ayari. “People are actually getting scared of going out and being confronted by the sun. You have empty streets in the daytime and huge crowds at night.“This heatwave we are witnessing is making me more and more concerned about our future in the city ... We have to talk more about the seriousness of this issue.” Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1372a9412e98444c29323fba275a13e2a58b88c7/0_0_5400_3587/master/5400.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa4ec2557ac03841eb53ef0cd4aa706f 700w","title":"instagram influencers advertising youtube vloggers kardashians","story":"When is an ad not an ad? When it works so well you don’t actually know that it is one? As in so many areas of life, regulators are scrambling to catch up with a digital world. The Competition and Markets Authority is investigating whether certain social media stars are properly declaring whether they are being paid to endorse products or services. This is mostly done by that mysterious elite level of sub-Kardashian mutants otherwise know as Instagram influencers who flaunt their curves, teeth whiteners, fitness programmes and posh herbs that give you “energy”.I, of course, am not influenced by any of these things. I am beyond all that, a superior being untouched by advertising, though only yesterday I clicked on a Facebook ad for something called a “Neck Wand” because I was bemused by what it would be. Mostly at my age the algorithms seem to think I would like to wear clothes that resemble floral burqas and shoes that medieval monks would refuse. Instagram is not my thing either. Since I lost my password I only follow two people: a friend who likes gardening and Sleaford Mods, so all I see is flowers and swearing, which is nice.Yet of course I know Insta is where it is at, and watching my teen and her mates it’s been clear for years that the vloggers of YouTube are the big stars. They sell themselves as a brand, reveal their hauls and make millions in doing so. If they dye their hair pink they don’t even need to mention the product.These old notions of branding and product placement have morphed into something that is everyday and ubiquitous. Social media is a world of advertisements for ourselves, for each other – it is just not called that. Asking celebrities to declare what they are paid to promote seems fair. Regulators, then, are looking for transparency – or that old-fashioned notion, accountability.But I fear it’s too late, as the ways social media has changed advertising have already happened. Old-fashioned adverting is in decline. The days of the memorable TV ad are gone, they are often very low-quality and basic. As TV channels proliferate, you can see they can hardly fill the ad spaces.Morally, yes, celebs and the banal influencers should be upfront about what they are doing, but that’s a bit like asking them to be honest about their no-makeup looks when they have heads full of Botox and self-promotion and profit margins. They are the product. We are the consumers. Yet social media means we are both the market and the content providers. It’s confusing out there. No wonder we are all selling ourselves short.The adage about advertising being the famous four Ps – product, place, price and promotion – has changed, according to Brian Fetherstonhaugh of the branding agency OglivyOne: it’s now the four Es: “experience, everyplace, exchange and evangelism”. The regulation of everyplace is, as we have seen with Facebook, proving difficult. The regulation of evangelism even more so. The duck pout, the long straight hair, the abs, the wellness loons, the appetite suppressants once promoted by Kim Kardashian – this is religious stuff. Do you believe you need to look like someone off Love Island? Well, here you go …As ever, what needs to happen here is not just regulation but education. Much derided media studies classes that taught us how to deconstruct adverts need now to be taught from very young, so that kids recognise when they are being sold to.Right now, the most effective advertising is advertising that denies that it is advertising. This is on a par with fake news. But too many of us buy it anyway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64f11a824d27657d1ecd2b3631c65f8de539cbe3/0_273_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae55d928d6b29da86d1568dd856c97e9","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"An anaesthetised polar bear, a surprising pine marten and a potty-mouthed parrot are among this week’s images "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bf9b1a341bb9135d0b2e9354ecf4cb8234fd40b/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d4684217813961dbba0352414c0799f","title":"helsinki fashion week to ban leather from 2019 as vegan fabrics catch on","story":"Vegan collections feature materials such as synthetic suede and B-mesh made from recycled bottlesFashion has been somewhat slow to mastermind viable – and desirable – animal-free alternatives to materials such as leather and suede, but this week the resolve picked up momentum.Established in 2003, the French label – which also sells trainers made from real leather – has proved to be one of the most covetable brands in the last two years, buoyed by ethical credentials that the fashion industry is increasingly seeking out. “Ultimately, brands still need to show great design and good quality, as well as sustainable credentials, so we’re very thoughtful about who we pick up. It’s a joy to come across Veja who have the whole package,” said Lisa Aitken, the retail fashion director at Net-a-Porter, which began stocking the label in January. The online retailer also stocks Budapest-based Nanushka, which was established by the London College of Fashion graduate Sandra Sandor in 2005 and introduced a £460 machine-washable quilted vegan leather jacket (£460) in its pre-autumnwinter 2018 collection.According to Rachael Stott, the senior creative researcher at The Future Laboratory, who notes “a global boom in plant-based lifestyles”, Gen Z is “a key driving force” in the demand for vegan alternatives. “They are conscious shoppers who want to know where and how their products are made and are actively using social media to cultivate a new dialogue around sustainability issues. As a result, they are voting with their wallets and are buying goods aligned with their ethics.”Several companies have made headway with vegan alternatives. Stott cites Pinatex, which has created a mass-market synthetic leather made from pineapple leaf fibres - a byproduct of the pineapple harvest - and Modern Meadows, which has developed bio-fabricated leather made from a genetically-engineered strain of yeast that produces animal collagen. She also notes that the material MycoWorks, which is grown from mycelium, the vegetative mushrooms tissue, “is not only sustainable, it can also be grown to almost any size and shape with a customised texture”.The trend should, however, be pursued with caution, she says. “Fashion brands should be commended for taking steps towards a cruelty-free supply chain, but the elimination of all animal products, regardless of whether they are ethically sourced, sends out a confusing message … It can give rise to low-value synthetic alternatives such as plastic-based PVC or ‘pleather’, which harbours its own environmental and ethical issues. “The manufacturing processes used to create these involve toxic chemicals and cause pollution in surrounding rivers and landfill sites. Currently there is no safe way to produce or dispose of PVC products, therefore consumers can be misled into thinking ‘vegan’ is entirely environmentally friendly.”Until now, Stella McCartney, who has never used animal products in any of her collections, has been the most famous advocate of vegan materials in the fashion industry. Her bestselling vegan-leather Falabella bag, which currently retails for £720, has remained on the top 10 must-have fashion lists since its inception in 2010. Other luxury brands, such as Barcelona-based M2Malletier, have also come up with alternatives to traditional materials. Its first vegan leather collection, which has just launched with prices starting at £475, aims to offer a “cruelty-free choice for the conscious shopper, as well as aiming to use sustainable leather-free manufacturing to curb deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions from farming cattle”, according to a spokesperson for the brand. NAK, which stands for No Animal Killed, has its shoes handmade in Italy by local artisans in a move to provide “opportunities for traditional craftsmanship to flourish in a new era of fashion design working with new materials”. They start at £200.

The bean stringer came out for a few weeks a year. Stringing beans would always be Dad’s job, because he loved them (still does). That bean stringer has now migrated to my kitchen and recently I’ve been stringing beans for dinner most nights. The two stand-out things I’ve made are a Keralan runner bean curry, and some buttery, soft runner beans cooked under a layer of olive oil, which a Turkish friend, Rosie, used to make us.This a quite a dry curry based very loosely on a thoran, but mine has a bit more sauce than a traditional thoran to suit British tastes. If you have the time and the inclination, you could use a fresh coconut and grate it, in place of the desiccated coconut – the resulting flavour will be worth it.1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped2 green chillies1 small thumb ginger, peeled and roughly chopped2 garlic cloves, peeledCoconut or vegetable oil1 tsp turmeric2 tsp cumin seeds3 tsp coriander seeds, bashed in a mortar1 x 400ml tin coconut milk50g unsweetened desiccated coconut, soaked in cold water for a minimum of 20 minutes 400g potatoes, chopped into bite-size pieces400g runner beans, destringed and sliced at an angle into 2cm lengths1 tbsp black mustard seeds1 handful curry leaves (optional)1 lemonTo serve1 green chilli, chopped1 small bunch coriander, choppedCooked brown or white rice4 roti or chapatisSalted dairy-free yoghurtPickles and chutneyFirst put the onion, chilli, ginger and garlic in a blender with two tablespoons of water and blitz to a paste. If you don’t have a blender, just finely chop everything.Heat a tablespoon of oil in a deep pan, add the onion mixture and cook for 10 minutes on a medium heat, until you have a thick, fragrant paste, adding a little more water if it’s beginning to stick before it’s cooked.Next, add the turmeric, cumin and coriander and cook for two minutes until they give off a toasted aroma, then add the coconut milk, desiccated coconut and potatoes. Fill the coconut milk tin with water and add this too, along with a good pinch of salt. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked.Next add the runner beans and cook for a further six minutes, until the runners are cooked and have taken on the flavour of the sauce.Heat a tablespoon of oil in a small frying pan on a medium heat, add the mustard seeds, curry leaves, if using, and a good grind of black pepper, and cook until the curry leaves are crisp and the mustard seeds pop. Take off the heat and drain on kitchen paper.Back to the curry: once the beans are cooked, taste, add salt and lemon juice to taste (I usually go for a whole lemon but you may prefer less), then finish with the chopped green chilli and coriander. Serve with rice and rotis, salted yoghurt, pickles and chutneys.I serve these for lunch or dinner with feta, crusty bread and some salad. You can buy stringless runner beans otherwise peel them along the sides with a veg peeler ... or use a bean stringer.150ml extra-virgin olive oil1 medium onion, peeled and finely chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped200g ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped400g runner beans, destringed and sliced at an angle into 2cm lengths2 tsp dried oreganoJuice of 1 unwaxed lemonHeat the oil in a deep, heavy-based pan over a medium heat, add the onion and cook for about five minutes, until softened but not browned. Add the garlic and cook for another minute or two, then add the tomatoes, green beans, oregano and a good pinch of salt. You are braising the beans, so you want them to be covered in the oil and tomato mixture if they are not, add a little water.Turn the heat down to low and cook the beans for 45 minutes to an hour. Check every now and then to make sure that the beans aren’t dry, adding more water if needed.The beans are done when they are soft and no longer squeaky, but not falling apart. Squeeze in the juice of half the lemon and grind in some black pepper. Taste, adding more salt, pepper and lemon as needed.

For years, it has been losing market share to prosecco, and people perceive it as cheap, so the logical answer is to up the quality and charge more for it. But you could also argue that cava is underrated – that it has a unique style, grapes and terroir, and that the best vineyards can produce quite special wines now labelled paraje calificado.The odd thing is that, having launched to great fanfare at the end of last year, these are practically impossible to find in the UK, other than in a handful of pricey London restaurants (Hedonism stocks Alta Alella’s Mirgin Opus 2013 if you put in a special order, while Tanners will have Freixenet’s seriously impressive Can Sala in the autumn, but that will be almost a year after the denomination was announced). True, there isn’t very much of it, and maybe cava producers are focusing on more lucrative markets than the UK, but it’s also possible that this is a case of snobbery: retailers just don’t think there’s a market for high-quality Spanish sparkling wine.This is a shame, because cava has something quite distinctive to offer. As opposed to most fizz that’s made in cool parts of the world, such as England and Champagne, cava is made in the hot, dry Penedès wine region south-west of Barcelona, where grapes ripen early (the harvest should be well under way by the time you’re reading this). This typically means they don’t have to add a “dosage” (the sweet liquor that rounds out leaner, sharper base wines), which makes for drier wines that are more versatile with food. You don’t normally get that degree of richness in champagne unless you age the wine on its lees for several years. And the growing conditions make it easier for producers to go organic.Basic cava, too, is increasingly decent and, now that prosecco prices have inched up, favourably priced as well. The slightly coarse, yeasty flavour of less expensive cavas has been replaced by an attractive creaminess that contrasts favourably with many cheap proseccos, which can taste unpleasantly thin and metallic. Also, the best examples have an impressive ability to age (I recently tasted a 2012 vintage of Cordoníu’s Jaume that was quite spectacular – the best deal on that I could find is a three-bottle case at €81.60 with free shipping, or £72.73 at time of writing), so you do feel that cava gets a bit of a bum rap. Try it again if you haven’t for a while.Well priced, with an appealing whiff of ice-cream soda. A good party alternative to prosecco. An elegant cava typical of the region’s new ultra-brut style. Cool label, too ...Rich, opulent, creamy cava with a luscious touch of oak. Try it with scallops.Another serious vintage cava: better than many champagnes at the price."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/276c1e0623d100d6d1d19b2a81bce3ffcf0446ed/0_92_2755_1653/master/2755.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56d1934bbfe2624370705489ee39c309","title":"eden hazard best in world chelsea maurizio sarri","story":"• Manager intent on holding on to Belgian playmaker• ‘I feared losing him for 20 days,’ says ItalianMaurizio Sarri believes Eden Hazard has the ability to establish himself as the best player in the world but has admitted he feared losing the Belgium forward in the three weeks after taking charge as Chelsea’s manager.Hazard, who came off the bench to set up the final goal in the 3-0 opening weekend win at Huddersfield, is expected to start against Arsenal on Saturday as Sarri oversees his first competitive fixture at Stamford Bridge. He was Chelsea’s top scorer last season and enjoyed an eye-catching World Cup, captaining Belgium to third place, only to suggest the time might be right “to discover something different”.Those comments were made in St Petersburg in mid-July, a few days after Sarri’s appointment and before the 27-year-old player’s departure on holiday, and it was more than three weeks before the manager met Hazard at Chelsea’s training base in Cobham.“I was concerned about this problem,” said Sarri, aware that the transfer window extends until the end of the month in Spain, where Real Madrid have long coveted Hazard.“But the first time I spoke to him, I was sure he would stay. So I was concerned for 20 days, no more. Hazard, technically, is really one of the best in Europe in this moment. He has to work from the physical point of view, of course.Sarri’s predecessor, Antonio Conte, had often suggested Hazard needed to contribute more goals if he was to challenge Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for the Ballon d’Or.“It depends on his position on the pitch,” Sarri said. “In the last five years, Cristiano has played like a striker, Messi like a striker, Eden sometimes like a winger. Eden can improve. We are talking about one of the most important players in Europe but he can improve more. He can be the first. It depends on him. The best for technical skill, the best for scoring but I think it depends only on him. On his mind.”While any belated interest from Real this month will be dismissed out of hand, no further progress has been made in talks over a contract. Hazard’s deal expires in 2020. Regardless, the playmaker remains a strong candidate to be named Sarri’s full-time captain at Stamford Bridge, with the manager still deliberating over who will wear the armband as he considers the squad at his disposal. César Azpilicueta will retain the honour against Arsenal, with Gary Cahill also among the candidates. A decision will be made only once Sarri has ascertained his first-choice lineup.“I think Arsenal, this season, can improve and be competitive, and can fight for a good position. They can be, for us, a direct opponent for the target of the club this season. A direct opponent for a place in the Champions League.“But, for now, all I want is my team to continue to improve their performances. In the first part of the season, it’s very difficult to gain points, so we need to improve performances. That is more important in this moment than the results.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9a7254e161bf306da538fd6f79950fde988abd2/0_38_2704_1623/master/2704.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=231e69d4892d631c42746beae451d780","title":"jose mourinho manchester united paul pogba happy","story":"• Manchester United manager says Pogba is ‘working well’ • ‘I cannot demand more from him, I cannot ask more from him’José Mourinho has claimed to be enjoying his strongest ever working relationship with Paul Pogba and the Manchester United manager praised the France midfielder for his application since returning from the World Cup – pointing in particular to last Friday’s display against Leicester City.Pogba continues to be an issue for Mourinho following the 25-year-old’s comments after that 2-1 win over the Foxes when he claimed he would be fined for “saying certain things”. Compounded by Barcelona’s rejected bid for him and Mourinho’s assertion that Pogba must treat each match for United with the same intensity as those he played for his country at Russia 2018 the pair have been reported to have a difficult relationship.Martial’s fine relates to the forward’s inactivity for over a week following the birth of his child in July. He is not expected to start against Brighton but Mourinho believes Pogba can turn in another impressive performance at Brighton, even if Valencia will resume the captaincy on his return from injury.“I am very confident but if he doesn’t that’s football,” said the 55-year-old. “If he doesn’t that’s football. If his objective is to play for the team, for the fans, if this is the objective – he has the right of a bad match, everybody has a bad day and has little ups and downs in the performance level.Mourinho also stated that Matteo Darmian is not expected to leave the club, with Italy’s transfer window closing on Friday.He said: “I don’t think he will go, and he cannot have any bad feeling towards us because we opened the door for him in case his desire was to go. But it looks like it’s not going to end in a transfer and for me is good news that Matteo is staying. He’s always an option for us, a reliable player, we know that his performance level is that one, we know he always does a job for the team.

That is the motto Arsenal chose\u0026nbspto accompany all\u0026nbsptheir messaging about the most pivotal of the five new recruits they have welcomed to try to help Unai Emery rework the shape of\u0026nbspthe team. Arguably, time for Torreira is long overdue in the sense\u0026nbspthat Arsenal have missed the kind of characteristics he possesses for aeons.It feels like a long time since Arsenal went to Chelsea armed with a midfield ready to compete seriously in that department. Once upon a time they used to approach this fixture with a feeling of superiority that came from years unbeaten at Stamford Bridge. A look\u0026nbspat the lineup towards the end of that era spells out why they felt able to walk so tall. A central midfield built around the muscular Patrick Vieira, Gilberto and Edu – all athletes over six feet tall who were as comfortable protecting the back four as projecting the game forwards – was a formidable obstacle for any team trying to make inroads of their own.Lucas Torreira does not obviously come from that lineage. One of the smallest players in the Premier League – he is the same size as the much-loved little marvel Santi Cazorla – he is more in the mould of intelligent screening midfielders Chelsea have specialised in, initially\u0026nbspwith Claude Makelele and currently with N’Golo Kanté. Torreira has a similar mix of instinctive knowhow to quickly get into the right places to intercept danger, with an accuracy of pass as the cherry on top.Arsenal’s great play-out-from-the-back debate has a greater chance of working with the arrival of a player who can receive the ball close to goal and is very efficient in small spaces. Torreira has that natural awareness of where to be and where others are to build the game more securely from the back.Emery has spoken of his “bright talent” and Torreira is ready to make his full debut at Stamford Bridge. “He is OK every day and is training well,” adds the coach. “He is now with the team, is learning English conversation with us and can understand all the things we want to do tactically on the pitch. I want to continue with him improving.”Torreira is expected to bring an injection of resilience. During the World Cup, in one of his most authoritative performances for Uruguay against\u0026nbspPortugal he actually made a clearance while the ball was rolling along the floor by jutting out his head while he was horizontal on the turf.The image seemed to encapsulate a dedication to the cause, an almost crazy bravery to stick his head among the boots, that was the opposite of the stereotype contemporary Arsenal midfielder who might be expected to back off or turn away or not even notice danger.In addition to the elements of his game that resemble a baseline player, he also naturally crafts a range of passes from the back because of his footballing education as a more creative playmaker. In his encouraging cameo against Manchester City he made a couple of important contributions and it was telling that he produced one of the few raking passes to find Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The striker was offside but it was a rare moment when Arsenal looked suddenly decisive and imaginative.The selection decisions that Emery makes for this game are intriguing in terms of the messages he sends out to his squad. A number of the established usual suspects were notably underwhelming last Sunday. Granit Xhaka and Henrikh Mkhitaryan could not seem to get any kind of foothold, while Mesut Özil and Aaron Ramsey looked out of sorts in unfamiliar positions – Özil very deep and Ramsey pushed high.So does Emery give them another\u0026nbspchance or shake things up? As well as Torreira’s strong case to start, Matteo Guendouzi deserves to remain in the conversation after his debut, and Danny Welbeck is also fit and could be used as one of the wide players – a player more naturally suited to pressing and engaging in physical work up and down the flanks. It will be interesting to see whether Emery feels it a safer bet in terms of his budding relationships with his players to favour the hierarchy of experience, or whether he has no qualms about giving out chances on merit.Emery admits he is seeking the right balance in the team, and not only from a defensive point of view. If\u0026nbspTorreira is able to control the reins at the base of midfield that may allow Arsenal to be braver going forward, able to pick their two main strikers, rather than starting with one and having the other as an option to come on.This is a challenging opportunity for Torreira to show his worth against a midfield of Kanté and Chelsea’s new signing Jorginho. It is a big chance for a little guy who Arsenal hope will turn out to be the most successful export from the Uruguayan town of Fray Bentos since corned beef."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0e0271d57ae9456dc90b056a259c91cc7e8ec94/0_301_5352_3211/master/5352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=485c7a6439221cb639cf647d021d7a0e","title":"super cup reaction and celtics champions league exit football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden and co on Atlético’s win over Madrid, European woe for Celtic and Bristol Rovers’ dubious half-time entertainmentRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

According to the latest accounts filed with Companies House, GetMeIn made a post-tax profit of only £1.4m in 2016, while Seatwave lost £3m.The chief cause of such lacklustre financial performance is the parallel success of controversial rivals StubHub and Viagogo, which will snap up any touts who were still using Ticketmaster’s secondary outlets.There is also a question hanging over the scale of Ticketmaster’s commitment to reasonable prices.Its premium Platinum service uses “dynamic pricing”, adjusting prices according to demand, much like airline seats or Uber rides, but in a far less competitive market.A leading market share in ticketing – coupled with parent company Live Nation’s global sway as a promoter and venue operator – gives Ticketmaster significant pricing power.In the case of Platinum, the company reserves some of the best seats in the house and, when the event “sells out”, drip-feeds them into the market at inflated prices.Paul McCartney’s upcoming UK tour appeared to have sold out within minutes. Seats at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, which had been on sale at £65, were later released via Platinum for more than £500.Ticketmaster says Platinum “takes touts out of the equation” because it makes top-quality seats available for a premium, but still for less than touts were charging.However, research by the  found that in many cases, secondary sites are offering nearly identical tickets to those available via Platinum but for less money.The company refuses to say whether Platinum customers have exclusive access to the best seats, or could end up sitting next to somebody who paid the normal price.The Labour MP Sharon Hodgson said Ticketmaster had “serious questions to answer about their business model”.She said: “To find Ticketmaster blatantly overpricing tickets that they deliberately hold back in order to do so shows just how broken this whole market is.”To be fair to Ticketmaster, the use of Platinum requires consent from the artist, who pockets the difference and must weigh up the risk of alienating their fans.Stuart Galbraith, the founder of Ed Sheeran’s promoter Kilimanjaro Live, said: “I’m not a fan of Platinum because I don’t think there’s any added value for the customer but it’s down to the inidual artist’s choice.”He said fans of artists who have experimented with dynamic pricing have seen the price of some tickets increase substantially. “For Taylor Swift and Jay-Z or Beyonce, you got prices that were £350 or £380.“For some artists, and Ed is an example, it was one price throughout at £75 or £80.”The choice may be in the hands of artists but Ticketmaster executives have been quick to blame artists who try to keep prices low for encouraging touting.Yet the company is a leading voice in an industry that has been too slow to develop technological solutions such as the digital ticketing systems offered by firms such as Dice, which offer ways to combat touting without capitulating to upward price pressure.Even if Ticketmaster’s withdrawal from secondary ticketing has no immediate positive effect on fans, it may at least sharpen the minds of lawmakers, regulators and businesses that still work with Viagogo and StubHub.Adam Webb, a spokesman for the music industry campaign group FanFair Alliance, said: “While it’s true that large-scale touts will continue to use StubHub and Viagogo, those two sites are currently under significant pressures. “In October this year, StubHub lost their partnerships at the O2 and the Wembley Arena. That’s a massive blow to their credibility. “Also, by January 2019 they must become fully compliant with UK consumer law and disclose details of any iniduals listing more than 100 tickets per year.  “Viagogo is under even heavier fire. It’s a toxic brand and facing enforcement actions worldwide, including from the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority and National Trading Standards. Those actions cannot come soon enough. “There will also be increasing demands on Google to stop taking their advertising. If that happened it would arguably be the most significant change of all. “Without their misleading dominance of paid search, Viagogo would likely be dead in the water.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb97eb1bd323d10ee1fa18e1a987f1ae101c1e3a/177_178_5420_3252/master/5420.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e64c2be320bfccf2270f867c230a51b","title":"the beggars opera review kings theatre edinburgh international festival","story":"King’s theatre, EdinburghAn updated version of John Gay’s classic features gags about the royal wedding and Brexit, but the music has missed a trickSeveral centuries before anyone thought of stringing together a series of pop numbers with a flimsy excuse for a plot and turning it into a hit musical, John Gay wowed 18th-century London with pretty much the same idea. The Beggar’s Opera was based on popular tunes cobbled together by a bawdy story populated with lowlife characters. The work satirised the conventions of contemporary Italian opera of which Handel was the master and lampooned famous figures of the age. It created a sensation and has been much imitated and reimagined by subsequent generations, most famously Brecht and Weill in The Threepenny Opera. Given that only the outlines of the tunes survive, it is a work that is ripe for reinvention by each successive age. This latest production from Robert Carsen and the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord is something of a curious hybrid. An ultra-modern setting and dialogue are paired with historical performance authenticity in which an attempt is made at some kind of faithful reimagining of the lost musical score. The result is cheerfully anachronistic. On the one hand there is Carsen’s slick, irreverent production, all gun-toting acrobatics, lots of swearing and a cast largely drawn from the West End stage, while on the other hand the musicians of Les Arts Florissants bring their period-instrument pedigree to the performance.  Much has been made about the updated satire in this new production, but despite a few topical gags about the recent royal wedding and politics, it’s all a bit underwhelming. In the age of the Panama Papers, who really cares about a little low-level bribery and corruption? Carsen’s production is largely an exercise in style over substance, and at this level it is enjoyable enough, except for one substantial drawback: the music simply isn’t that interesting. You can’t help feeling that Carsen and his team missed a trick in not being as adventurous in reinventing the music as they were the rest of the production."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/089c7260109ceb1b59a57f2458754ef6dfe00327/0_364_2765_1659/master/2765.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a9d425629d65979f0ab8bdf1a2c44b3","title":"the queen of soul aretha franklin a life in pictures","story":"The queen of soul for six decades, Aretha Franklin, has died aged 76.

Rinkēvičs said it was a “very considerable risk” but stressed he remained optimistic an agreement with Britain could be reached.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Jensen was asked about Rinkēvičs’s remarks. He said: “I also believe that 50-50 is a very good assessment because time is running out and we need to move really fast if we’ve got to strike a deal that is positive both for the UK and EU.”He said that everyone who wanted there to be a good deal “needs to put in some effort in the months to come, otherwise I’m afraid that time will run out”. He went on to describe Theresa May’s Chequers plan – which includes a pledge that the UK would apply domestic tariffs on goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs on goods heading into the EU – as a “realistic proposal for good negotiations”.“We need to go into a lot of details but I think it’s a very positive step forward and a necessary step,” he said.The discussion comes after the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, warned that a no-deal Brexit would be “a mistake that we would regret for generations”. Eurosceptics in his party accused him of weakening May’s hand by making such comments.Ministers have spent weeks emphasising that May is “not kidding” when she says she will walk away rather than accept a bad deal, but Hunt sent the opposite message, suggesting that Britain would make concessions.Jensen refused to say whether Hunt would be easier to work with than his predecessor, Boris Johnson, but said: “I do believe that we had a good cooperation with Boris and I’m sure that we will have good cooperation with Jeremy.”In an interview with ITV News, Hunt said the UK would find a way to “prosper and thrive” but a no-deal Brexit would be a “geo-strategic mistake”.He said: “We want a deal with the EU that means we really can have a deep and special partnership, a friendship, going forward, not just in terms of our economic relations but in terms of everything else that happens on the world stage, and it would be a mistake that we would regret for generations if we were to have a messy, ugly orce and that is what we all want to avoid.”Hunt’s comments drew criticism from Brexiter MPs. Conor Burns, a Tory MP, told the : “The thing that we want to avoid for ‘generations to come’ is being locked into a permanent orbit around the EU where we end up with a deal but don’t have a seat around the table.”The foreign secretary said later on Twitter his warning was intended for the EU, saying it would be “a big mistake for Europe because of inevitable impact on long term partnership with UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbb996adcf3f9fabb5d118cbe6a679767a26baa4/848_171_2652_1591/master/2652.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d490860a643233aca8b8465fe53ea32d","title":"jeremy corbyn foreign causes a blessing or a curse","story":"The Labour leader’s campaigns have provided inspiration for supporters and ammunition for his detractors. Ewen MacAskill takes a close look at the recordAndrew Murray, Jeremy Corbyn’s longtime friend and adviser, ticks off a list of foreign causes that the Labour leader has pursued over almost half a century: Chile, South Africa, Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, among others.For Murray, it is an honourable record, and one that has been distorted or lost amid the abuse and vilification Corbyn has faced since he stood for the Labour leadership in 2015.The Labour leader has been accused of racism and antisemitism of being too close to the men of violence. During last year’s general election campaign, the Daily Mail, under the headline “Apologists for terror”, said Corbyn “personally has spent a political lifetime courting mass murderers in the Middle East, Ireland and elsewhere in the world”.Returning to the theme this week, newspaper articles have implied – in a story subsequently disputed – that Corbyn had paid homage in 2014 to Black September, the Palestinian group responsible for the 1972 massacre of Israeli athletes.Since Corbyn became leader, there have been tensions within his office as well as within the parliamentary Labour party about whether his record on foreign affairs is a negative or a plus.One school of thought is that he should just shut up about it to avoid attracting the kind of controversy he has faced over the last few weeks, and that, anyway, general elections are won or lost on domestic, not foreign, policy. The alternative view is that Corbyn has a good story to tell and his foreign policy positions are more popular than the political classes believe.Corbyn has ended up somewhere in the middle, not hiding his record but not shouting about it either, making only a handful of speeches devoted specifically to foreign policy. He delivered one apologising for Labour’s role in the Iraq war, he did another in London during last year’s general election campaign, another in response to the Manchester bombing and one in Geneva in December last year.He is planning another in the next few months.For many rightwing commentators, the left lost the ideological battle when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. The left, however, counters with a list of foreign policy issues on which it has been proved right, going back to the Vietnam war, and Corbyn’s supporters see him as the personification of this.For them, he has been a consistent opponent of misguided western military intervention, a supporter of countries and people fighting for self-determination, an advocate of peace through dialogue, totally opposed to violence, and not in thrall to armed struggle.David Clark, who was a special adviser on foreign affairs to the late Robin Cook, arguably the most leftwing foreign secretary the UK has had, agrees Corbyn has been proved right on many issues. But this is heavily qualified, with Clark dismissing Corbyn’s “simplistic anti-imperialist stance” and what he sees as a reflex response of opposing every western military intervention.“If you oppose every intervention, you are going to be right from time to time,” Clark said. “Much like a clock that is stuck telling the right time twice a day, Corbyn has been right on some of the issues.”Murray does not see it like that. “Jeremy has called every major policy issue in the last 40 years – from apartheid to Iraq and Libya – right, when the establishment has been mostly or unitedly wrong,” Murray said.Corbyn’s interest in foreign affairs can be traced back to a trip that straddled 1969 and 1970, taking in Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile.These were heady days on a continent full of drama: military coups, liberation theology and the US secretly conspiring with the right to undermine leftwing governments and movements. In 1969, Corbyn took part in a student demonstration in São Paulo against Brazil’s military dictatorship.It was Chile, however, that had the greatest impact. He was in the country in 1970 when Salvador Allende, who was on the left, became president. He was overthrown three years later in a brutal military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet. Corbyn had found a cause.By contrast, Margaret Thatcher, on becoming prime minister in 1979, restored diplomatic relations with Pinochet’s Chile, which had been broken off by the previous Labour government. When Pinochet was arrested in the UK in 1998 in response to an extradition request over human rights violations, Thatcher treated him like an honoured guest, visiting him at his temporary home in Surrey.In his Geneva speech, Corbyn praised Allende and derided Pinochet for turning Chile “into a laboratory for free market fundamentalism”.Corbyn’s interest in Latin America has never waned. During internal policy discussions, he has often blindsided others by unexpectedly raising issues such as the recent election of the leftwing populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador as Mexican president.While there is a general consensus that Corbyn has been right about Chile, views are polarised over his unwavering support for the late Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, a persistent opponent of the US, and his reluctance to criticise his successor Nicolás Maduro.Corbyn was an early opponent of apartheid, serving on the national executive of the Anti-Apartheid Movement. One of the best-known pictures of him shows him being arrested in 1984 for protesting outside South Africa House in London.He was later exonerated and awarded compensation, which he donated to the Anti-Apartheid Movement and to Nelson Mandela’s African National Congress.While the late Mandela is now generally venerated, that was not the case in the 1970s and 80s, with Thatcher describing the ANC as a “typical terrorist organisation”.Corbyn recalled this in a tweet earlier this year opposing Theresa May’s invitation for Donald Trump to visit the UK. “Margaret Thatcher was on the wrong side of history when she supported apartheid,” he wrote.Thatcher’s position has undergone attempts at revision. Robin Renwick, the British ambassador to South Africa from 1987-91, said Thatcher had opposed apartheid and, behind the scenes, had pressed the South African government to release Mandela.One of the keys to understanding Corbyn is the Stop the War coalition, founded less than two weeks after the 911 attack. Labour MPs who joined included Tony Benn, George Galloway and Corbyn, who went on to chair it for four years. Murray was also a member.Stop the War helped organise the London march on the eve of the 2003 Iraq war, one of the biggest protests in British history, and opposed intervention in Afghanistan, Libya and Syria. Corbyn spoke at an estimated 1,000 events around the country, a dress rehearsal for his Labour leadership campaign.Setting out his opposition to the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, Corbyn put the blame for the rise of the Taliban on America: “The Taliban were formed with US weapons. Al-Qaida was founded by US trainers. What goes around comes around.”His interest in Iraq predated the invasion. In the 1980s, when the US and UK governments were backing Saddam Hussein in the war against Iran, supplying him with arms, Corbyn was opposed. As an MP, he was among the first to condemn Saddam’s chemical attack on Iraqi Kurds at Halabja in 1988.He opposed UK military involvement in Kosovo in 1999, Libya in 2011 and Syria in 2015, and described UK participation in airstrikes in Syria this year as legally questionable.Clark says not all military interventions are necessarily wrong, citing the Nato airstrike on Serbia to protect Albanian Kosovans and the subsequent invasion of Kosovo, which Corbyn opposed.Clark also argues that the Libyan intervention was well-intentioned, to stop a massacre, and the failure was in the subsequent lack of nation-building.Corbyn denies he is a pacifist and has said he does not rule out supporting UN military intervention, though the only example he will cite is UN intervention in East Timor in 1999.Corbyn’s support for the Palestinians has caused him more problems than any other foreign policy issue. A long-time member of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, he has been accused of being too close to Hamas, the elected government in Gaza, and to Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the anti-Israeli paramilitary organisation based in Lebanon.His involvement in the Palestinian cause is at the root of accusations against him of antisemitism, which have dominated Labour politics for the last two months. According to one of those close to him, Corbyn has been more upset by this than all the previous vilification campaigns he has faced, believing it is it much more intense and personal.Some of those around him will say privately they feel he has been the victim of a smear campaign. But even some of these find him culpable for allowing the row to drag on, citing the rewriting of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition.Newspapers this week carried stories about Corbyn’s presence at a Palestinian cemetery in Tunis in 2014.One story read: “A memorial wreath in hand, Jeremy Corbyn stands feet from the graves of terror leaders linked to the Munich Massacre … Buried in the cemetery in Tunisia are members of Black September, the terror group which massacred 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics.”A number of problems emerged with the story, not least that none of the members of Black September who carried out the massacre are buried in Tunis. Another is that the wreath-laying ceremony was to commemorate members of the Palestine Liberation Organisation who were killed in a 1985 Israeli air raid on Tunis, a raid condemned by Thatcher at the time.There have been other such stories linking Corbyn to armed groups in the Middle East and elsewhere, including Ireland.The writer Ronan Bennett, who worked as a research assistant for Corbyn at Westminster in the 1980s, said he had never heard Corbyn support the idea of armed struggle.“As a leader, Jeremy is not without flaws, and his ideas may not always be fully worked out, but he is principled. He said to me the whole point of engagement is to persuade people to put away the guns,” he said.Bennett, whose presence at Westminster caused a stir at the time, with him having been a prisoner at Long Kesh in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, said: “He really has only one speech, one theme: that we should all get together and be nice to one another. Jeremy is a kind of vegan, pacifist idealist, one with a clear understanding of politics and history, and a commitment to the underdog.”One of the charges against Corbyn is that he is hypocritical in presenting himself as an independent arbiter while in fact being an activist. That he is pro-Palestinian rather than neutral. His supporters see no contradiction, arguing it is possible to take a side and still promote dialogue.Corbyn came under attack from both Conservative and Labour MPs in March after refusing to blame Russia for the Salisbury nerve agent attack.He might have got away with such an expression of scepticism a week later. Instead, it created another row, another distraction, including accusations he is soft on Russia.Corbyn has never been one of those on the left who was close to the Soviet Union.George Galloway, a friend of Corbyn for 40 years who was also a parliamentary colleague and campaigned alongside him at Stop the War, said: “He was never, unlike myself, pro-Soviet. He is not an orthodox Trotskyist communist. He is more woolly Californian. He has more in common with Michael Foot than Karl Marx. He is a pacifist who will speak to anyone.”While not an adherent to the Soviet Union, Corbyn is opposed to Nato, which puts him out of line with party policy. He described the US-led coalition as “a danger to world peace”.He reflects a view common on the left that, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US and Nato had a chance to embrace Russia but instead expanded eastwards, taking in former members of the Soviet bloc.Clark, who has established a reputation as a Russia specialist, sees Corbyn’s instinctive hostility towards US dominance as problematic. “His simplistic anti-imperialist position leads him to be insufficiently critical of regimes such as Russia. People around him see Putin as a counter-balance to western imperialism.”Clark said the problem with such an approach was that Putin’s transgressions tended to be overlooked. “The Ukraine crisis is a point in question. Corbyn’s reaction was to blame the aggression on Nato rather than the aggressor. That is the conclusion you come to if you share Corbyn’s anti-western world view.”It is debatable whether Ireland should be on a foreign list, given Northern Ireland is part of the UK. But Corbyn has been a longtime supporter of a united Ireland.He courted controversy in October 1984 when he invited two former republican prisoners – Linda Quigley and Gerry MacLochlainn, the latter jailed on explosive charges – to the Commons just two weeks after the bombing of the Tory conference in Brighton.In May last year, Northern Ireland again dogged Corbyn. In what can be seen as a prelude to the Tunis cemetery controversy, the Labour leader was asked during a televised election debate about attending a meeting of the republican Wolfe Tone Society in 1987 at which there was a minute’s silence for eight IRA members killed by the SAS.He said: “The contribution I made to that meeting was to call for peace and dialogue.”Danny Morrison, Sinn Féin’s former head of communications and a former member of the Northern Ireland assembly, recalls Corbyn visiting them in west Belfast in 1984.“At no time did he express support or solidarity for the armed struggle,” Morrison said. “The point is, Jeremy Corbyn never ever supported physical force in Ireland. You can have this position and still sympathise with those who died like Bobby Sands. It is scandalous and ridiculous to suggest there is a link between Corbyn and the IRA.”Such meetings were controversial but Corbyn can claim vindication by revelations the British government was engaged in secret meetings in the same period, a dialogue which eventually brought about the 1998 Belfast peace agreement.Corbyn’s campaign team expected from the day he first put himself forward to be leader that his foreign policy record would be picked over by opponents.One of those close to him, reflecting on the last few weeks, acknowledged it had been tough, but said: “He has been through it before. And he will face it again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9901aa474a153ea9efdba3cb4c8fe8c8aa0be99/0_93_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd0785f4c854628ef497939d377e073a","title":"corbyn to criticise tech firms media influence in edinburgh speech","story":"Labour leader will give Alternative MacTaggart lecture at annual TV festivalJeremy Corbyn will use an appearance at Edinburgh television festival to criticise the role of billionaire owners, and large internet companies such as Facebook, in the British media.“A strong, erse and independent media is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy and society,” Corbyn said on Friday in a preview of the speech next week.“I hope to offer some perspectives on the UK media and its role today, discuss how good journalism challenges the powerful and what is holding it back in the digital age of tech giants and unaccountable billionaires.”The Labour leader has agreed to give the Alternative MacTaggart lecture, one of the major events at the British television industry’s annual get-together in the Scottish capital.His speech will be followed by a Q\u0026ampA session with the actor Maxine Peake, a longtime supporter of Corbyn who has promised to ask him about “life, policy, culture and which soap character he most identifies with”.Corbyn has been increasingly willing to directly criticise the media. This week, he decided to confront most of the British newspaper industry head on, formally complaining to the press regulator Ipso about how six national outlets had covered his decision to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony at a Tunisian cemetery where Palestinian activists are buried.He has generally had a better relationship with broadcasters than newspapers. During the 2017 general election campaign, Corbyn’s team focused on using TV news channels to get their message across to the public, in the belief that the heavily regulated world of broadcasting meant he would be guaranteed to receive more coverage.Despite Corbyn’s frequent battles with the media, the Labour party remains vague on what it would do to reform the industry. Its 2017 election manifesto pledged to hold a national review of the decline of local news outlets and the ownership of national media businesses. It also pledged to secure funding for the BBC and put in place clearer rules on who is fit and proper to own or run TV and radio stations.Media policy is still within the purview of the party’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who is also the shadow culture secretary. This year, he came close to forcing the government to hold a new public inquiry into the activities of the media industry and social media companies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5640faf561568dff80ff76aaffeb65fe9bcc790/119_0_5175_3107/master/5175.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14294faef89d93a98923b97b012fe2dc","title":"k2 spice synthetic marijuana new haven green overdose","story":"At least 95 people in New Haven overdosed on the drug in two days, as similar events become more common across the USWhen a raised voice breaks out above the downtown din in New Haven Green park, the shouts are often drawing attention to yet another person who has had a bad reaction to the synthetic cannabinoid K2, also known as spice.The drug users who frequent the 16-acre park in New Haven, Connecticut, which is just steps away from Yale University’s gothic campus, describe that reaction as a “fallout”, and so far it has happened to 95 people over the course of two days this week.This mass, rapid-fire overdose event was a sped-up version of what is happening across the US as local and federal governments struggle to reduce the colliding impacts of opioid, methamphetamine, cocaine and other addictions.Phil Costello, the clinical director for homeless care at Cornell Scott-Hill health center, works often in the Green from his temporary office under a tent. “That batch that came in yesterday, with all the people falling out, has just made this basically a mass casualty incident,” Costello said.He and a team of other nurses and addiction counselors stood by cots, ready with bottled water and the overdose reversal agent narcan, which has proved largely ineffective against synthetic cannabinoids.In 2017, drug overdoses killed nearly 200 people per day, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data released this week, a new record driven by the deadly opioid epidemic.Since K2 was first detected in the US in 2008, clusters of overdose outbreaks have become more and more common. About 56 people overdosed from K2 in Brooklyn in May 100 people overdosed in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, in July 2017 and 40 people overdosed in Dallas, Texas, in May 2014.Sometimes K2 is laced with the powerful opioid fentanyl, but investigators including the federal Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) said they have not yet found any in the New Haven sample.Officials said there have not been any deaths from this batch of K2, but they fear the long-term consequences of a drug that causes hallucinations, vomiting and a rapid heart rate.K2 is also known as synthetic marijuana because it interacts with cannabinoid receptors in the central nervous system to produce psychoactive effects. But K2 is much more potent and is an unpredictable mix of differing concentrations of different chemicals that are poured or sprayed on plant material.Despite the mystery of each batch, K2 is appealing to drug users because its cost is low, its chemicals aren’t detected on standard drug tests and its changing mixtures make law enforcement efforts more complicated than with purer drugs such as marijuana.“It’s just a daunting, daunting thought for the future,” said Costello. “This is a much bigger problem and a much bigger threat to national security than other things.”Costello, a nurse, is known as “Dr Phil” to the hundreds of homeless who frequent the green and when not treating patients this week, he was constantly greeted by people he has helped in the past. “Everybody knows each other and they try to take care of each other the best they can,” Costello said.The green has a manicured lawn and is surrounded by nice restaurants and cute shops, but it is also where people shoot drugs in the daytime and don’t hesitate to ask the stranger sharing a bench with them where to buy K2. It’s where hundreds of the city’s homeless spend their days, but the rest of the community doesn’t seem to linger.Costello said on a normal day on the green, one or two people might need emergency medical care because of drug use. But not so with this batch, which police suspect was distributed by two men, including one accused of handing out it for nothing to lure in clients.“With this particular version they have convulsions, psychotic episodes and become completely catatonic and barely responsive, which makes them very vulnerable to people who might want to take advantage of them,” Costello said.At the peak of overdoses on Wednesday, 46 ambulances were responding to calls.“People were dropping all over the green, it was just mass amounts of people,” said Daena Murphy, a clinical social worker at the community health center, Cornell Scott Hill Health Corporation, who worked alongside Costello this week.“Fallout” rates slowed on Thursday, though in one 15-minute period, police and health workers darted around the park to respond to three distressed iniduals.A bystander or friend would call out, wave their arms and point at a victim lying on the ground or silent and still on a bench. In seconds, someone with a stethoscope, stretcher or water bottle would be running their way and ambulances would surround the scene.Murphy warned that what had happened this week in this city of 129,934 people was happening across the US.“After the TV cameras leave, we are still here,” Murphy said. “It’s not just New Haven.”The dean of the Yale school of public health, Sten Vermund, said: “My fear is that the synthetic cannabinoids might be a new wave.”“It’s occupying the fire department, the emergency room at Yale, you can imagine the pain and suffering of the patients’ families, on the patients themselves,” Vermund said. “It’s quite a big burden on a small city. It would be a big burden on a big city.”Yale has been on the frontline of responding to the New Haven city green overdoses, with its emergency room caring for most of those affected and its pharmacologists analyzing the product and blood tests."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/924190e416055ab8fedf660afd674cb395aaf99b/0_0_5370_3223/master/5370.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b533cfa7244bdc1645b248bccd5c0fc1","title":"period poverty north ayrshire council scottish labour free sanitary products","story":"North Ayrshire sets up scheme in toilets of public buildings to help tackle period povertyA Scottish council will provide free sanitary products in all public buildings in a scheme aimed at breaking the taboo about period poverty.North Ayrshire council believes it is the first local authority in the UK to introduce the policy, which will come into effect in up to 100 libraries, community centres and other public offices from Friday.Joe Cullinane, the Scottish Labour leader of the council, said the move followed the success of a scheme that had been providing free sanitary products to all secondary schools in the area since last August.“When you’ve got that kind of momentum in schools, you think that periods don’t stop at the school gates, so what about their sister or mother?” Cullinane said. “How can we normalise this even further, so that it’s like providing toilet paper or handwash?”Cullinane estimates the initiative will cost £40,000, a large part of which will initially be spent on vending machines for women’s toilets.Research published by the Women for Independence (WFI) group last spring revealed that nearly one in five women in Scotland had experienced period poverty – the struggle to pay for basic sanitary products on a monthly basis – which has a significant impact on hygiene, health and wellbeing.Cullinane said: “It’s about dignity and respect, at the end of the day. It’s not just about the cost, but about normalising the whole subject, and that’s where the debate should be going nationally.”He stressed the importance of making the scheme universal. “Any scheme that relies on women asking for help still has a barrier,” he said. “Now a woman can be going into a library for any number of reasons, and then go to the toilet and use the vending machine discreetly without there being any taboo.”Scotland is leading the way in offering greater access to free period products. The government will provide free products in all schools, colleges and universities from this autumn, while the Scottish Labour MSP Monica Lennon has introduced a member’s bill at Holyrood to launch a universal scheme. Many businesses and organisations – including Celtic football club – have also started providing free products.Lennon described the North Ayrshire scheme as “a breakthrough for gender equality”. She said: “The ambition behind my member’s bill is for Scotland to lead the world on menstrual health and this is about changing our culture as well as the law, so I’m delighted that North Ayrshire council is leading by example and helping to change attitudes towards menstruation and access to period products.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c17d65d0ddf3c38e3b3dc2db1a1e3f35b15c327/0_132_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=158f0cb948b10f9b9b60919af80b33b1","title":"cases of type 2 diabetes among young people rise 41 in three years","story":"Leap brings calls for ministers to act to prevent so many children getting grossly obeseGrowing numbers of children and young people are developing type 2 diabetes, a disease usually seen in those aged over 40, in the latest sign of worsening childhood obesity.The sharp rise has prompted concern among doctors and led to renewed calls for tougher government action to tackle the relentless increase in the number of dangerously overweight youngsters. “Type 2 diabetes is a disaster for the child and their family and for the NHS,” said Graham MacGregor, a professor of cardiovascular health at Queen Mary University of London who is also the chair of the campaign group Action on Sugar.“If a child gets type 2 diabetes, it’s condemning them to a lot of complications of that condition, such as blindness, amputations and kidney disease,” he said. “These figures are a sign that we are in a crisis and that the government doesn’t seem to be taking action, or not enough and not quickly enough.”The figures have been collected by paediatric diabetes units at hospitals across England and Wales and collated by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH).“Type 2 diabetes typically develops in adults over the age of 40, so – while still rare in children – it is extremely worrying that we are seeing more young people develop the condition,” said Izzi Seccombe, the chair of the community wellbeing board at the Local Government Association (LGA), which obtained the figures from the RCPCH.The figures show that people from some ethnic minorities are much more likely than others to develop type 2 diabetes. Almost half of the 715 young people were black or Asian. “Much more needs to be done to reach out to black and ethnic minority groups over the disease,” said the LGA, which represents 370 councils across England and Wales. The figures come soon after it emerged that 22,000 children aged 10 and 11 in England are severely obese because their body mass index (BMI) is at least 40. For adults, a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 means someone has a healthy weight 25 to 29.9 denotes they are overweight 30 to 39.9 means someone is obese and 40 or above signifies severe obesity. “The rise in type 2 diabetes in young children highlights why bold measures are needed to tackle childhood obesity – and change won’t happen overnight”, said Eustace de Sousa of Public Health England (PHE).Ministers recently announced measures intended to halve childhood obesity by 2030, including:But much firmer action is needed, said MacGregor. “Appeals to people to eat more healthily won’t be enough. We need to ban the marketing and advertising of unhealthy foods altogether, not just limit it, as ministers are considering.Seccombe, a Conservative member of Warwickshire county council, criticised government cuts to councils’ public health budgets as “short-sighted” given the scale of the obesity epidemic. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “We know the damage obesity causes and are determined to halve childhood obesity by 2030. “We’ve invested billions in public health services and have already removed the equivalent of 45m kilograms of sugar from soft drinks every year. “Our new childhood obesity plan will now get children exercising more in schools and reduce their exposure to sugary and fatty foods.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2af9e7d36f1a21944a300f302c855804e49651d7/0_21_2718_1631/master/2718.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acab1ecb96414973511b6278c6a8319d","title":"dina asher smith role model european championships wins","story":"One small measure of how Dina Asher-Smith has catapulted into the mainstream came at her local Costa on Friday morning, when she was given a coffee on the house. “The lady was saying: ‘You come in here for six months and we chat about everything but you never mentioned you were an athlete!’” says Asher-Smith, smiling. “There has been so much interest since the European Championships, which is very humbling, especially from people who wouldn’t typically engage with the sport.”The 22-year-old estimates she has given 45 media interviews since arriving back from Berlin on Monday with three gold medals around her neck. There have also been plenty of selfies with fans as well as “a lot of love on social media”, including from global stars such as the grime singer Stormzy. But something else has twigged too. An understanding that she has begun to transcend her\u0026nbspsport. “Lots of people have been\u0026nbspreferring to me as a role model which I still find very odd. But at the same time I am rolling with it, because I do have a social responsibility to make sure young people have a positive person to look up to.”Certainly more people want a piece of her now – and that includes her sprint rivals. For when she returns to the track in a red-hot 200m at the Birmingham Diamond League on Saturday the world’s best sprinters will be desperate to claim her scalp. “The field is more like an Olympic final,” she says. “But that is what I love about female sprinters, we always turn up and give our A-game and there isn’t much ducking and ing.”Her biggest challenge will surely come from the world 400m Olympic and world champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo, who beat her over 200m in the Commonwealth Games in April. As she admits: “It is going to take more than a perfect race to take Shaunae down. She has run 48.9 for the 400m which is out of this world – she is so insanely talented.”But there are several other dangers lurking in the field, including the 100m and 200m world silver medallist Marie-Josée Ta Lou, Shericka Jackson – who beat Asher-Smith into bronze at the Commonwealths – and the reigning world 200m champion Dafne Schippers. However Asher-Smith is determined to lay down a marker before next year’s world championships in Doha and the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.“I am well aware the Europeans didn’t include the best sprinters or the best sprinting nations in the world,” she says. “That is why I am telling everybody to relax and chill out. My times are good but you don’t know how it is going to translate at world-level competitions.”After Birmingham, Asher-Smith plans to compete over 200m at the Zurich Diamond League and Continental Cup in Jamaica – before finally letting herself go. “I have quite a long off-season since we have\u0026nbspDoha quite late next year. I am going to sleep lots – and eat lots and lots of bad food.”While Asher-Smith will surely get\u0026nbspthe biggest cheer of the day, the most exciting race is likely to be a stacked men’s 100m which features the world 60m record holder Christian Coleman and the fastest man in the world in 2018, Noah Lyles, going up against the best of the British talent, including Zharnel Hughes and Reece Prescod.When the season is over Hughes, who won the European 100m title last week, intends to go scuba ing and swim with sharks. But it is clear that he expects plenty of blood in the water in Birmingham too. “These guys are going to be coming here to take me down,” he says. “Being European champion puts a target on my back but great competitors like this also equal great times.”Coleman, meanwhile, intends to make a statement having had an interrupted season after smashing the 20-year-old world indoor 60m record in February. “I have a lot to prove,” he says. “Not only to other people, but to myself, that I’m the best in the world. But I don’t know of many people that can take almost two months off of not being able to train fully then come back and go up against the best guys in the world. I don’t think there’s anybody out there that can beat me.”Many eyes will also be on the local lad Matt Hudson-Smith who is hoping to break Iwan Thomas’s 21-year-old British 400m record of 44.36sec. Hudson-Smith should be helped by the presence of Botswanan Isaac Makwala and the American Fred Kerley but he says he very nearly gave up athletics last year. “I was pretty close to quitting and I did quit at one point. I talked to my strength and conditioning coach and he said: ‘You don’t want to be that person who everyone says: ‘He could’ve have been.’ So I packed my bags, I went to America and it was the best decision I ever made.“I was so spoilt it was a joke. If I was hungry, I went to my nan’s, if my nan wasn’t in, I know for a fact my nan’s friend would feed me. Now I have to cook for myself. Now I have to do everything for myself. And my coach, Lance Brauman, says I have grown up.”Kelly Holmes’s British 1000m record of 2min 32.55sec could also be under threat with Laura Muir – who won 1500m European gold last Sunday – targeting another national record. “As long as the conditions are good, I feel like I am on target to go for it,” she says.But, as has been the case for much\u0026nbspof the past week, all eyes will be on Asher-Smith as she sets out on the path of turning European success into global domination. “The fact I am at home will also make it 10 times as intense,” she admits. “I am under no illusions about what is coming. But I am not going to put on a bad performance in front of a home crowd.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4eec0dc96f175ab6c76c964186279dc66425bd0/103_0_3691_2215/master/3691.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfe6b8fbcbcba867c3cfbfc48458118f","title":"england joe root virat kohli third test india","story":"Trent Bridge, some green grass, a first autumnal chill in the air plus the sudden appearance of news reporters who seldom show so much interest in Test cricket.Everyone knows what to expect. Ben Stokes’s every move, every grimace and smile will be minutely monitored so, too, the reception he receives when he comes out to bat. The ball will swing around deviously so that England’s seamers, including Stokes, overwhelm the India batsmen and the series will be secured.All of which may happen. But it is not guaranteed. Stokes has been this way before. His first “rehabilitation” Test was in Auckland in March this year and he was barely noticed. England were bowled out for 58, lost the match by an innings and 49 runs yet before the postmortems had started Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft selflessly deflected attention from England’s ineptitude – as well as Stokes’s return – with the spectacular collision of a cricket ball and sandpaper in Cape Town. “Ben Who?” said the news editors.This time it is closer to home in Nottingham, so often the haven of English cricket, where Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad combine effectively so that the home side prevail. But that cannot be guaranteed either.Twelve months ago England arrived here in good heart to play South Africa and lost by 340 runs. England batted for 96.1 overs in that match as opposed to South Africa’s 200.2. Some of the question marks from that game remain Alastair Cook and Keaton Jennings mustered 48 runs in four innings in that game the bowling was overreliant on Anderson Stokes contributed 18 runs and four wickets.However, it is clear that England have arrived here the more confident side, wondering whom to leave out rather than whom to pick. Once Stokes was added to the squad, a decision that Joe Root acknowledged was taken by those above, he was always going to play, though they dutifully went through the procedure of logging his fitness and his state of mind.Not since 13 August 1955 has a Test in England started on a Saturday, when Peter May captained a team featuring Brian Close, Denis Compton and Jim Laker against South Africa at the Oval (they would win by 92 runs). Fast-forward through 63 years of mostly Thursday starts – with a few Fridays, Wednesdays and, in 2014, a Sunday – and we are in the midst of a five-Test series being played over a breakneck 42 days.India were keen on a break after the ODI series in July and another before the Asia Cup that begins in the United Arab Emirates on 15 September. This spacing was felt fairest, with three days scheduled between the first and second Tests and four between second and third (as it happened, the early finishes at Edgbaston and Lord’s added extra rest to the schedule anyway). If we go the full five days at Trent Bridge there will be an eight-day gap before the fourth Test in Southampton.From a cricketing perspective the decision to reinstate Stokes straight away makes perfect sense. Just at the moment Stokes needs to relax, to be among his mates and to find a medium to express himself freely, and there is no better place for him to do that than in the middle of a cricket pitch. That is where he is most at ease.This is an attribute shared by some of the great figures of the game. Ian Botham, Shane Warne and Kevin Pietersen have all been able to produce staggering performances on the field when their life beyond the boundary was in some sort of turmoil. Geoffrey Boycott was never more relaxed than when he was batting the crease was his natural habitat. All of them welcomed being in the haven, where they could excel in their specialist subject.This is what encourages the notion that Stokes will be in the right frame of mind to perform well at Trent Bridge, a far more alluring venue for him than the one he visited last week. Once the decision to reinstate Stokes was taken, then Sam Curran was always the likeliest man to give way.It is tough on Curran, who was the man of the match at Edgbaston two Test matches ago. But it is a tough game he is a tough cricketer and a bright one, who probably recognises that the aim of the captain and his advisers should be to pick the best team rather than the fairest one.Moreover, as Root pointed out, the best time to get dropped is when you are playing well. Curran is blameless his stock is high, sympathy abounds and he will be back in the side soon, as well as being pencilled into the squad for the winter.If anyone deserves sympathy it is probably Jamie Porter of Essex, who awaits a Test debut after being selected in three squads. Even with a bit of rotation, which is often promised more frequently than it takes place, Porter may struggle to get a game this summer.The mere talk of rotation sharpens the minds of the bowlers eager to add to their tally of Test wickets against an India team who have exceeded 200 in only one of their last nine innings in England.Perhaps they should introduce this concept of rotation to the batsmen as well. Not that batting has been easy in this series and that may well be the case over the next few days. This concerns India more than England and the tourists may well shuffle the pack again in their desperation to provide more support to Virat Kohli.The pitch does not resemble one of the bare, shiny surfaces that are rolled out for ODIs here, which are liable to produce 700 runs in a day. There is a little live grass visible to ensure that a captain has to think at least twice about opting to bat first.Both Root and Kohli, who looked fit and phlegmatic on the eve of the match, will look at the skies as much as the grass before one of them makes his decision. If overcast, there will be the temptation for the captain winning the toss to throw the Dukes ball to his bowlers. This has been a series where there has been consistent deviation in the air and here a lush outfield will allow the ball to keep its shine. If there is movement off the pitch as well as in the air, the match may be over before Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4bc102181c348f8d6c5473f23c09c2367915a1b/0_102_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d331bec7ecb4097466b7d122fe265c02","title":"ambien elon musk roseanne celebrities blame sedative behaviour","story":"Elon Musk, Roseanne Barr, Tiger Woods and others have all claimed the sedative was at fault for their strange behaviorElon Musk’s erratic public declarations are reportedly worrying Tesla board members, and a main concern for executives is a sedative Musk says he has been using: Ambien.“It is often a choice of no sleep or Ambien,” Musk told the New York Times in an interview published on Thursday, which came after the Tesla founder claimed on Twitter that he was considering taking the company private.The tweet sparked a furore among both markets and media, while lawyers warned he could have broken a law prohibiting publicly traded companies from announcing plans to buy or sell securities.If Ambien is to blame, Musk would not be the only celebrity to act strangely under the influence of the sedative, or to claim that acting strangely was the fault of the sedative.In May Roseanne Barr memorably blamed Ambien for a series of racist tweets which led to her ABC sitcom being cancelled.“It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting,” was Barr’s defense for a message comparing former Barack Obama aide Valerie Jarrett to an ape. She also accused George Soros of being “a nazi”.The drug manufacturer Sanofi, which makes Ambien, issued a statement after Barr’s outburst saying “racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication”.Ambien, commonly prescribed for insomnia, was found in Tiger Woods’ system when he was arrested for a DUI in 2017. Police found Woods’ car parked on the side of the road with the engine running, the brake lights on and a right turn signal blinking. Woods said prescription medication was to blame.Charlie Sheen said Ambien was responsible for him allegedly trashing his New York City hotel room in 2010. The New York Post reported that “tables and chairs had been thrown around the room and a chandelier was also damaged”. In 2011 Sheen explained his behavior to the news show 2020:“Ambien, the devil’s aspirin! I think that led to that thing in New York. That was the one thing in the mix that was not part of my normal blend.”Appearing on the Late Show in 2017, Sean Penn pre-emptively blamed Ambien for any potentially disruptive behavior.“I’m doing well,” Penn told Stephen Colbert at the start of the interview. “You’ve inherited a little of the Ambien I had to take to get to sleep after a red eye last night.”A disheveled-looking Penn then started smoking a cigarette.Back in 2016 Paul Schrader, the screenwriter behind Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, pointed a finger at Ambien for a Facebook message in which he said Donald Trump’s presidency was “a call to violence” and “we should be willing to take arms”. The post earned Schrader a visit from the NYPD’s counter-terrorism unit.“A couple of cabernets and half an Ambien, and God knows what you’ll post,” he later told the Hollywood Reporter. “That is something that you have to be careful about because Facebook is not private correspondence.”Ambien’s pervasive influence in the world of celebrity is such that it even gets a mention in the Jay-Z and Alicia Keys song Empire State of Mind, in which the pair sing about New York City.“MDMA got you feelin’ like a champion,” Jay-Z says in the song.“The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9dcc2340fa7c80afe70ca4b9f4be94586832cd9/0_7_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fac15a72b3374b63592ad75f74a3ac6","title":"elon musk says past year has been excruciating and worst is yet to come","story":"Musk says he has endured ‘the most difficult and painful’ time in emotional interview as confession wipes billions off Tesla valueElon Musk has said the past year of his professional life has been “excruciating” and that stress over his business had caused his health to deteriorate. To make matters worse, the confession wiped billions off the value of Tesla, the electric car company he founded.In an emotional interview with the New York Times, the founder of electric carmaker Tesla also revealed that the pressures of work had caused him to spend his birthday stuck in the Tesla factory and almost miss his brother’s wedding.“This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,” he said in the interview.Musk, whose company posted a record $709.6m net loss in the first quarter of this year while struggling to manufacture large numbers of its Model 3 mass-market electric car, said he had been working up to 120 hours a week and his health had been “not great”. He said his friends had been worried about him.Musk said there were times he didn’t leave the factory for three or four days at a time and days when he didn’t go outside.He said he spent the entire 24 hours of his 47th birthday in June at work and flew directly to his brother’s wedding, where he was due to be best man, from work, arriving two hours before the ceremony and leaving immediately afterwards.Musk sparked a furore in the markets, the media and among investors earlier this month when he tweeted his intentions to take his publicly traded company private, with the assurance: “Funding secured.”Lawyers have warned that his tweet may have broken rule 14e-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which prohibits publicly traded companies from announcing plans to buy or sell securities if executives don’t intend to complete, don’t have the means to complete, or are trying to manipulate the stock price.In the interview with the New York Times, Musk blamed short-sellers, from whom he said he anticipated “a few months of extreme torture”.“I thought the worst of it was over,” he told the New York Times. “But from a personal standpoint, the worst is yet to come.”He denied “being on weed” at the time of the tweet and said he saw it as an attempt at transparency, but admitted in the interview on Thursday that no one had seen or reviewed it before he posted it. Observers puzzled over the price he cited.Musk explained that with an estimated premium over recent values, the share price should be around $419. He decided to round it up to $420, he said – a number that is slang for cannabis.“It seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419,” he said in the interview. “But I was not on weed, to be clear. Weed is not helpful for productivity. There’s a reason for the word ‘stoned’. You just sit there like a stone on weed.”Musk, who is a controversial figure, has drawn further criticism this year for his tweets. Last month he launched an extraordinary attack on one of the British ers involved in the rescue of 12 boys and their football coach who were trapped in a cave in Thailand, baselessly calling the er a “pedo” on Twitter.In June, Musk caused outrage when he responded to a tweet from a woman who claimed Musk had used her father’s unicorn artwork on Tesla merchandise without compensation or attribution, by telling her: “He can sue for money if he wants, but that’s kinda lame.” Musk later settled the dispute with the artist.Musk has also lashed out at both the media and analysts from large Wall Street banks in recent months, calling questions from analysts “boring, bonehead questions” and suggesting he would start a website to rank the credibility of inidual journalists, after Tesla received negative press coverage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12007a9d55bdcabfeff37f687e3bfc6eeb16d4bd/563_536_3287_1973/master/3287.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e83ac4671aeef136d00dfaf9dae145c","title":"the community space bringing scandinavian chic to glasgow","story":"For Fika Sake has become the centre of a thriving community in the heart of Scotland’s largest city, as part cafe, part learning space and lifestyle hubThe idea for an events space centred around coffee and cake was inspired by a place where so many good things originate – Scandinavia. Fika is the most recent Swedish tradition spreading across the globe. “It’s about taking time out of your day to actually sit down and maybe relax with someone or maybe yourself – usually over coffee and cake,” says Simon Forsythe, Glasgow-based owner of For Fika Sake.Forsythe’s space is part cafe, part community hangout and part creative workplace. Covering 185 sq m (2,000 sq ft) in the centre of Glasgow, For Fika Sake is drawing in everyone from students and freelancers to yogis and parenting groups who want to engage with other locals and like-minded people while learning something new.Forsythe brought the idea to life in January 2016, opening the doors after a year of planning. “It started when I was having fika at a cafe in town with a friend,” he says. “I was working a part-time job in a normal cafe and was fed up with that experience. She was running music workshops in Glasgow and wanted to work on a different project.” After bringing in one other partner, they came up with the name: For Fika Sake. “We thought up a funny, controversial title, a play on words and we stuck with that and went with it,” says Forsythe.The sense of community created by the cafe extends beyond its doors – the coffee, tea, and cake that give the space its name are sourced from local suppliers. On any day of the week you can walk into For Fika Sake to find people filling the space with music from an old piano donated by a local social enterprise, in pottery workshops run by local artists up on the mezzanine, discussing their latest reads during a book club, or catching up with friends.“It’s great to have this kind of community coming in and using the space for what it was originally designed for,” says Forsythe. “One in particular that stands out is the community for young parents. The big space means they can come in and store their prams in the corner and hang out with other parents and their babies.”After a challenging start, seeing the space come to life has been the big payoff for Forsythe. In December 2016, he had to take on the business himself after his two partners left to pursue other projects. “It was a bit of a shock,” he says. “But the business seems to have taken off since last January.” While he admits it was tough, particularly with the other stresses that come with starting a new small business – like big overheads – he says one of the perks to come out of it is being able to make decisions quickly and easily. “There was no compromise-with-partners involved, so I was able to get things done and out of the way,” he says.Now word of mouth has spread and the business is growing, and that quick decision-making is allowing Forsythe to try new ideas and systems to keep things running smoothly. He recently switched over to a new platform to help him get on top of his cashflow. He chose Square because he liked the “cool and simple” card machine – but also because he could access his funds the next working day.“It’s made a massive difference,” he says. “With this kind of business the most important thing for survival is cashflow, so being able to access your funds the next working day is a serious win. If it’s over the weekend you get your cash on Monday rather than Wednesday.”It’s also given him the time and freedom to focus on drumming up creative ideas for new workshops and events to help the cafe thrive. But if creating a community hub was the grand idea behind the space, it’s the cafe and fostering the tradition around fika that Forsythe reckons is the powerhouse of the enterprise. “It keeps the business going and it creates that space for people to use the workshop side of things,” he says.Using Square’s app, he can create a product button for a new kind of service on the spot – a convenience he appreciates, given the ever-changing use of the space and the introduction of new workshops and events. “Overall, it’s running nice and smoothly and going with that original plan, which is amazing to see.”Where does he see himself next? Hopefully with a second space, in a few years, although perhaps somewhere sunnier. “I’d love to see it grow and take on another premises in another part of Glasgow or potentially in another city,” he says. “But working on what we have right now and just gearing up more towards the community and growing it within this community is still number one.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fc65808ba5c259dfa635e60fd906d88014eb1a6/0_77_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b76c23e2462813892a24bdcd64737c2","title":"manchester city the football documentary all or nothing amazon","story":"Docu-series have ruined the reputations of many, from Malcolm Allison to Graham Taylor. Now the Premier League champions have let Amazon’s All or Nothing crew in to the Etihad In the autumn of 1980, Granada TV sent a documentary crew to follow the fortunes of Manchester City, then struggling near the bottom of the old First Division, and their manager Malcolm Allison. At the time, Allison was one of football’s great outsized figures, a cigar-smoking, fedora-wearing rent-a-gob who also happened to be a visionary coach – albeit one whose reputation for motivating players was very much on the slide by the time Granada’s cameras arrived at Maine Road.Aired in 1981, CITY! A Club in Crisis, is a sometimes toe-curling, entirely engrossing, all-access account of the end of Allison’s reign at the club. In the space of an hour of television, Allison watches his City side lose two crucial matches, is summarily sacked by oleaginous chairman Peter Swales, and then returns to the club for an FA Cup tie as manager of Crystal Palace, where the team are soundly beaten by his old charges. To make matters worse, his replacement at City is former teammate John Bond. In a post-match press conference, Bond issues a withering critique of Allison’s management style, all while Allison sits in silence a few seats away, cigar in gob, eyes fixed murderously on the middle-distance.More than three decades on from the broadcast of A Club in Crisis comes All or Nothing, another behind-the-scenes account of life at Manchester City, although one that, name aside, seems to concern an entirely different club. Long gone are the mahogany-panelled boardrooms of Maine Road, replaced by the gleaming glass-fronted offices of City’s Etihad stadium and new academy complex. In the place of Swales, who made his money through a TV rentals company, the club is led by member of a Middle East oil dynasty, and – most strikingly of all – the shambling, “cups for cock-ups” City of the 80s, 90s and 00s has been usurped by the serial winners of the Pep Guardiola era.All or Nothing, the latest instalment of an Amazon franchise that has so far profiled the All Blacks rugby union team as well as multiple NFL outfits, follows Guardiola’s side in the season where they amassed a record 100 points. Narrated by Ben Kingsley, it’s a glossy, behind-the-scenes look at the inner workings of a side at their peak. Ahead of its launch, its creators trumpeted the “unprecedented access” they had received from the club, and it certainly wasn’t an idle boast, with the footage taking in treatment rooms, transfer negotiations and everything in between.In truth, City have become the sort of outfit which should really run a mile from the all-access documentary. Because, historically, the medium has been one where reputations, rather than enhanced, are destroyed. Just ask John Sitton, former manager of Leyton Orient and subject of Channel 4’s 1995 doc Club for a Fiver. Ostensibly a film about the financial struggles of the-then second ision side, it is now more famous for the volcanic outbursts delivered by Sitton to his beleaguered squad, one of which ends with him offering to have “a right sort-out” with two of his charges. Sitton’s managerial career never recovered, and his career has since taken in stints as a martial arts expert, football data expert and taxi driver.Sitton’s is by no means the only legacy-shredding meltdown to have been captured for posterity by a no-doubt delighted camera crew. The England boss Graham “do I not like that” Taylor famously suffered the same indignity in Channel 4’s Cutting Edge doc An Impossible Job, a film that provided confirmation that dressing rooms are extremely sweary places: Taylor’s 38 uses of the word ”fuck” in the documentary was a record number for a British TV broadcast at the time.Taylor’s impressive effort was bested three years later by Peterborough boss Barry Fry’s 48 uses of the expletive in Anglia’s There’s Only One Barry Fry. Peterborough and Fry would return to the screen just under a decade later in Sky One’s Big Ron Manager, which saw the disgraced coach and pundit attempt to rebuild his career by mentoring Posh manager Steve Bleasdale. Things didn’t quite go to plan: annoyed by Atkinson’s incessant input, Bleasdale quit two games from the end of the season.For clubs on their uppers, such as Orient or Peterborough, which were reportedly paid £200,000 by Sky for the privilege of Big Ron’s presence, the promise of cash and the potential for exposure is worth the danger of embarrassment. That riskreward is less enticing for clubs further up football’s food chain, which is perhaps why bigger clubs have historically been more cautious in allowing access to their inner sanctums, choosing instead to release their own controlled behind-the-scenes footage on inhouse TV networks such as MUTV, or club websites.What seems to have changed things is the rise of US sports franchises such as HBO’s NFL series Hard Knocks and the earlier seasons of All or Nothing, both of which present a high-octane, access-all-areas form of documentary that – crucially – still seem to present the subject sport in a positive light. Such series, with their focus on narrative and personality rather than technical details, are also well-suited to international markets that might not be au fait with said sports.In recent years, a similar model of documentary has been tentatively adopted in football, beginning with the 2012 series Being Liverpool, which followed the club’s progress over the course of a pre-season. That effort was slated for lacking decent access, although it did at least provide some eye-opening footage of manager Brendan Rodgers’ curious motivational methods, which included warning his squad that he had the names of three players who will “let us down this year” in a trio of envelopes. Then last year came Netflix’s First Team: Juventus, which offered higher stakes, taking place as it did across a full Serie A season, but still received criticism for lacking “moments of vulnerability”.Certainly going by early previews All or Nothing is a sizeable upgrade on Being Liverpool and First Team. The series sets out its intentions at the start of its first episode, with footage of Guardiola delivering a manic team talk at half time of the League Cup final. Later in the same episode, the cameras are allowed to linger as the team’s left back Benjamin Mendy is told the extent of his ultimately season-ending cruciate ligament injury.At times, as when midfielder David Silva discusses the premature birth of his son, or Sergio Agüero is filmed alone at home, a continent away from his young son, the series proves genuinely moving. Indeed, the access granted All or Nothing is sufficiently unprecedented to have reportedly angered Sky, which in all its years broadcasting the Premier League, has never been given the opportunity to film half-time team talks or bust-ups in the tunnel.At the same time, City’s blanket promotion of All or Nothing on their various social media channels indicates that there’s nothing here that they’d prefer to keep buried. The club have said that they did not have editorial say on the final cut of the series, although were allowed to veto legally iffy or commercially sensitive scenes, and what is on show is less warts-and-all than charming imperfections. That’sunderstandable given that Amazon itself has a stake in the success of the Premier League and, by extension, its best club, with its rights to one of the league’s live broadcast packages beginning next season.Still as different as this thoroughly modern documentary might seem to its grittier, grubbier predecessors, one thing remains pleasingly unchanged: the swearing. Before the opening credit sequence has rolled, Guardiola has managed three fucks and a middle finger. It’s not quite Fry and Taylor levels, but at least a grand old footballing tradition remains unchanged.Six Days to Saturday (1963)The week in the life of a scarily young Swindon Town team is the focus of this early all-access doc, one that features the amusing sight of the County Ground’s caretaker shooing pigeons from the stadium’s rafters with a rifle.United (1990)Not every great football documentary ends with failure: this six-part BBC series follows Harry Bassett’s Sheffield United as they battle their way back to the top flight for the first time in decades. Each episode follows a different aspect of the club: players, fans, wives, board, apprentices and the manager.Premier Passions (1998)Blackly comic five-parter about Sunderland’s 1997 relegation from the Premier League, which came just as they were constructing the gleaming new stadium that they hoped would cement their status among the elite. A new film, following Sunderland’s relegation to football’s third tier, is due later this year.The Four Year Plan (2009)Described by the ’s Michael Hann as “the most vivid insight into the running of a football club committed to film”, this follows owners Flavio Briatore and Bernie Ecclestone’s “four-year plan” to get Queens Park Rangers into the top flight. They got there eventually, although not before sacking a staggering number of managers.All or Nothing: Manchester City is available on Amazon"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/736869b443e87efcacb0968724adf38b35bf0d2e/616_478_3303_1982/master/3303.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34bc0ad12fa185c93c57f4a129708168","title":"eamon martin ireland catholic primate priests need spread word home pope francis visit","story":"Primate of all Ireland calls for ‘new evangelisation’ ahead of Pope Francis’s visit to DublinCatholic priests in Ireland need to be missionaries in their own country to meet the challenges of a changing society, Eamon Martin, the most senior church figure in Ireland, has said ahead of the pope’s visit to Dublin next weekend.“We are in mission territory in many ways as Catholics in Ireland,” Martin, who is archbishop of Armagh as well as primate of all Ireland, told the .“Ireland was always renowned as a missionary country, sending priests all over the world to spread the Catholic faith. But there’s a need for mission here in Ireland now, a need for a new evangelisation.”In the four decades since the last papal visit to Ireland, that of John Paul II in 1979, the country has seen a steep decline in the numbers of people attending mass and the moral authority of the church has been shattered by revelations of child sexual abuse and mistreatment of vulnerable women in the Magdalene Laundries.Ireland was a “very different society” today, said Martin. “Actually, to be honest, it’s a much more exciting and challenging place to be a priest and a pastor than to be part of some kind of big systemic culture in Ireland in which everyone does everything because that’s what the church said they have to do. Those days are long gone.”Pope Francis has faced calls to address issues such as the legacy of sexual abuse and its cover-up, LGBT rights and the role of women in the church during his 36-hour visit to the World Meeting of Families.“Sometimes people ask me: ‘Do you think the church can draw a line under the issue?’ I really don’t think we can.“When you meet survivors of abuse, they never draw a line under it. It’s with them for the rest of their lives – the horrific betrayal of trust, the sins and the crimes of the church, our shameful efforts at avoiding scandal which in the end created more scandal … It’s a shadow that’s there all the time.”The “awful, heinous wound on the body of the church” was not just a matter for local parishes or dioceses to deal with. “This is a systemic issue for the whole church. This is not an isolated issue of a bad priest in a particular school or parish. This is an issue where the whole culture of our church wrongly facilitated abuse.“Pope Francis can offer something, speaking on behalf of the church universal, that could be extremely helpful for all of us – survivors and those of us doing our best to deal with the legacy, the awful hurt and trauma that this issue has left.”Although other institutions and organisations in society were also facing up to the legacy of abuse and cover-up, the Catholic church could provide a model of “how a worldwide institution can accept its responsibility and then become, please God, at some stage instrumental in the healing of the terrible hurts that have happened. Pope Francis is the sort of person who can lead us on that journey.”He added: “Francis, ever since he arrived on the scene, has been challenging for all of us. He’s pushed us to consider the marginalised, the disadvantaged, to reach out to migrants, the homeless, to those forgotten in the normal day-to-day discussions in the public square. A lot of what he has said has disturbed our comfort as a church.”The archbishop said there was a “clerical culture” in Ireland, in which leadership was seen to be priests or bishops. “There are a lot of women already playing central leadership roles. We have outstanding women leading up our Catholic schools, for example, but if they do not feel affirmed in their role then we are failing and I’m saddened,” he said.In response to criticism and claims of exclusion from LGBT groups, he said for the first time the World Meeting of Families will host two panel discussions on how the church can “reach out to families struggling with this issue”.“How can we be faithful members of our church and present our teaching in a truthful, yet loving and merciful, way to all our children? That for me is the challenge,” Martin said.“Many groups feel excluded, feel we are insensitive in our language and our approach. The WMF wants to be welcoming, but people must realise this is an event of the Catholic church.”Martin was disappointed that Francis would not be visiting Northern Ireland during his brief visit, but hoped the pope would address the situation there.“I think he should affirm our efforts for peace. People are still carrying the wounds and traumas of the Troubles. I would love Pope Francis’s presence to speak to these people who are suffering because of conflict, war and violence in Ireland and other parts of the world.”He expected “thousands upon thousands” of people from Northern Ireland to travel south to see the pope, and said he would continue to invite Francis to make a papal visit to the north."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Fianna F\u0026aacuteil deputy leader also calls for Fine Gael to be \u0026lsquohonest\u0026rsquo about its failuresArchbishop of Boston says change only possible with significant involvement of lay men and womenAhead of the CAO offers being released, it is worth noting that progression to college directly from school is not the only routeTeam of four barristers shared daily payment of \u0026euro10,000 by DPP on top of brief fee\u0026lsquoAstronomical\u0026rsquo incidence of E coli infection this summer with 715 reported casesPatient sought help after her eyelid became swollen and droopy\u0026lsquoThere was an entire lack of empathy for the concerns we were presenting\u0026rsquoAvoid food poisoning with four simple steps: clean, cook, chill and separateCrash happened near Monasterevin on Friday afternoonRed Hot Mommas have delivered objections to plans for facility with sea outflowCommission insists there is \u0026lsquorigorous standard-setting and high quality\u0026rsquo during gradingArchbishop Eamon Martin says he expects Pope Francis to meet victims during Irish visitIrish Government had asked the DUP leader to attend the pontiff\u0026rsquos speech in Dublin CastleMore than 100 road closures for Dublin as people urged to take public transport to Phoenix ParkResidential Landlords Association says Daft exaggerating rental increasesJoanna Jordan alleged irregularities in the conduct of the campaign and registration of votersRelative of person killed during Troubles says PSNI deputy chief lacks independenceRodgers is alleged to have made \u0026lsquonegative comments\u0026rsquo in the media about council staffA selection of questions put to our helpdesk about the 2018 Leaving Cert results and next week\u0026rsquos CAO first round offersGroup takes over house on North Frederick Street after leaving Summerhill properties"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3599443.1534532943!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"housing activists occupy second empty inner city dublin property","story":"A group of protesters who were occupying a house in Dublin\u0027s north inner city have vacated the property.

A “Homes for All” banner was hung from the building, and two iniduals, in Leo Varadkar and Guy Fawkes face masks, could be seen on the first-floor balcony.Earlier, the High Court told campaigners to leave 35 Summerhill Parade, Ballybough, which they had occupied since last Tuesday. An order, sought by PJ O’Donnell – a director of Pat O’Donnell \u0026amp Co machinery plant supply firm, which sponsors Clare GAA – required the occupants to leave the property by 8am on Friday.The Summerhill property was owned by the company’s staff pension fund, of which PJ O’Donnell is a trustee. The campaigners complied with the court order and vacated the property.An agent for the plaintiff and several private security staff gained access to the house shortly after 9am, and later, large steel shutters were placed over the first-floor windows and front door.On Friday afternoon a group of 50 supporters marched from outside the Summerhill property to North Frederick Street, where a small team of activists had occupied a four-storey Georgian building.In a statement the activists said the group, which includes activists with Dublin Central Housing Action, Dublin Renters’ Union and student protest group Take Back Trinity, had taken over the second building to “continue to highlight the need for organised action” to protest the housing crisis.The “outpouring of support” for the initial occupation of a vacant house in Summerhill, “has given us hope for a strong, organised housing movement”, the statement said.“The Government is not about to change this squalid housing crisis – the people are. Summerhill was only the tip of the iceberg. We’re ready to keep going,” the statement said.Representatives of the protesters are scheduled to meet Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy on Thursday. The activists secured a commitment for a meeting following a sit-in protest at the Department of Housing offices in the Custom House on Wednesday.The campaigners are calling for a total ban on evictions, for local authorities to buy vacant houses via compulsory purchase orders, and for all vacant land to be used to build public housing.The protesters said the North Frederick Street building has been vacant for several years. The last registered owner of the property was Orla McGreal, according to documents from the Registry of Deeds. Previously the property had been in receivership, deed records show.On the steps of the front entrance, activists passed a sign-up sheet around for supporters to volunteer to take shifts in the building. Inside the building, occupants blocked the view into the ground floor.One inidual inside the property said it was not clear what it had previously been used for, and the old building “hasn’t been modernised very much”, they said. “It was dirty, dusty, but we’ve cleaned it up and it’s habitable,” the occupant said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3599684.1534523974!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"artlene foster declines invitation to pope s speech","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader and former Stormont First Minister Arlene Foster said she would be away with her family at the time.

She accused the DUP of willingly ensuring that Stormont institutions are kept suspended because it suits the party’s agenda at Westminster and she said Sinn Féin was playing into its hands with its abstentionist policy. “These MPs matter all the more because since that disastrous snap election that Theresa May called where she lost her majority, their numbers are currently keeping May’s government in power,” she said. “The collapse of power-sharing in Stormont, with no imminent sign of its return, further adds to the imbalance in Northern Ireland’s democratic voice.” She accused the Government of “megaphone diplomacy” in relation to the backstop agreement that followed in the aftermath of the December agreement between the EU and the UK. There it was agreed that Northern Ireland would retain regulatory alignment with the EU if no deal could be reached between the EU and the UK. She said it created unnecessary tensions in Anglo-Irish relations and among Unionists. Speaking on the same platform at the Parnell School, former Siptu president Jack O’Connor, who will be a Labour party candidate in the forthcoming general election, said he too believed the Government had oversold the backstop arrangement agreed last December. Mr O’Connor said in his experience of 42-years as a union leader, he had learned the dangers of overselling deals. “The more you hype what you have achieved in negotiation, the more difficult it is for the people you negotiate with. The more you jeopardise the potential for the next agreement,” he explained. “This was a time for a more mature approach.” Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/17/16/waterworlds.jpg","title":"waterworlds common discovery alien life proof rocky exoplanets nasa","story":"Created with Sketch.Scientists expect to find much more about the strange worlds in the coming yearsClick to followThe Independent OnlineWatery worlds could be common throughout the universe, scientists have said in a discovery that could have major effects on the search for life elsewhere in the universe.Planets covered in large amounts of water could be far more common than we\u0027d previously realised, according to the new study.

By comparison, the Earth is only 0.02 per cent water by weight.It was a huge surprise to realise that there must be so many water-worlds, said lead researcher Dr Li Zeng from Harvard University.The worlds themselves might have water, and might even have life. But that doesn\u0027t mean they look anything like our home planet, or even a watery version of it.This is water, but not as commonly found here on Earth, said Li Zeng. Their surface temperature is expected to be in the 200 to 500 degree Celsius range. Their surface may be shrouded in a water-vapor-dominated atmosphere, with a liquid water layer underneath.Moving deeper, one would expect to find this water transforms into high-pressure ices before we reaching the solid rocky core. The beauty of the model is that it explains just how composition relates to the known facts about these planets.Previous studies have found that many of the 4,000 confirmed or potential exoplanets fall into one of two sizes: those that are about 1.5 times the radius of the Earth, and others that are roughly 2.5 times the size of our planet.The new research looks to explore how those planets might be structured on the inside. It found that the smaller of the planets tend to be rocky – but the bigger ones are probably water worlds, according to the researchers.Scientists expect to find more of those planets – and therefore more water worlds – in the coming years. Leading that search will be Nasa\u0027s TESS mission which will look out for more of the exoplanets, and the James Webb Space Telescope which is due to launch in 2021 and will analyse the atmosphere of those worlds.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/28/10/mi6.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/28/10/mi6.jpg","title":"final say brexit referendum steel union peoples vote eu uk petition","story":"Created with Sketch.Exclusive: Major union joins the campaign as The Independent also teams up with People\u0027s Vote\u0026nbspfor mass march in LondonClick to followIndy PoliticsBritish steelworkers join The Independent\u0027s campaign for a Final Say referendum on BrexitBritish steelworkers today throw their weight behind The Independent’s campaign for a Final Say referendum on Brexit. \u0026nbspThe Community union – representing some 30,000 workers in total – calls on Theresa May to “do the right thing” and allow the British public to determine their own future.In a further significant development in the drive for a new referendum, The Independent and the People’s Vote campaign are joining forces for a mass march through central London later this year.The alliance will see the two organisations mobilise activists and media across the country to capture the growing tide of opinion that a further referendum on Brexit must be held.Polls show fast increasing support for the idea amid deepening Tory isions, doubts that Ms May can secure parliamentary backing for her plans and meagre public support for her approach.Relations between UK and EU negotiators have also descended into a new state of paranoia this week, with Brussels not denying reports that its officials believe they are being bugged by British spies.It is against this backdrop that Community general secretary Roy Rickhuss writes exclusively for The Independent, saying: “In June 2016, the British public gave our government a mandate to go and negotiate a withdrawal from the European Union.“Exactly what that looked like was unclear, but Theresa May told us she would go in and negotiate a deal that is in the best interests of British workers and their families.“It now seems that such a deal is unachievable or may not exist. That is why my trade union, Community, is backing\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Final Say\u0026nbspcampaign, to secure a people’s vote on the final deal.”Contribute to the march of a generationAt the last People’s Vote March in June, well over 100,000 people marched on parliament.Community’s roots are in textile manufacturing and the steel industry – pushed to the brink of collapse in recent years as much larger economies such as China distort international markets.In 2018 the industry has faced new pressure in particular from steel tariffs imposed by Donald Trump’s US administration, which Brexiteers are relying on for a favourable future trade deal.Community also supports prison and justice workers, logistics, finance, politics and public affairs staff, the charity and freelance

“profoundly different to those presented in 2016”, branding the promise of £350m a week for the NHS “worthless” and the guarantee that European trade would not be harmed as “at best a mistake, and at worst a deliberate lie.”The general secretary added: “When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is\u0026nbspgood enough.When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is good enough.\u0026nbsp If that outcome is rejected, then all

away from asking our members to vote on important or difficult issues in the workplace our politicians must do the right thing and give the people a Final Say on their future.”The People’s Vote launched in April demanding a referendum on the deal agreed with the EU\u0026nbspand has a grassroots network of around 1 million people, holding rallies and action days across the country.The Independent launched its own Final Say campaign three weeks ago,\u0026nbspso far gathering 615,000 names to its petition along with a string of political endorsements.In June this year more than 100,000 people from all walks of life marched on parliament to demand their democratic voice be heard in a new Brexit referendum.But following the newly forged alliance, the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future, on Saturday 20 October\u0026nbspin London, is set to be much larger.Ireland is closer than ever to unification because of BrexitWhy hasn’t the NHS been prioritised in

gathering, with young people whose voices were not heard two years ago at its forefront, will constitute one of the most significant demonstrations in British history – just as Ms May returns from Brussels from a critical Brexit summit.Amatey Doku, vice-president of the 7\u0026nbspmillion-strong National Union of Students and a supporter of the For our Future’s Sake group that backs a new referendum, said: “This Tory government, unfortunately assisted by the Labour Party,\u0026nbspthreaten to harm young people’s futures.Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011“That’s why students across the country are coming together for the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future. Students and young people can no longer be ignored – and on 20 October, we won’t be.”The prime minister had once aimed to have a deal agreed with Europe earlier this summer, but with negotiations badly stalling and a major cabinet fallout, expectations turned to the October summit.British ministers privately admit it is now unlikely the UK will be able to agree a deal even by October, with a special summit potentially needed before Christmas – leaving just three months in the new year for the UK and the EU to ratify any agreement.It is also unclear if Ms May will be able to navigate any deal across her party’s deep isions, with the European Research Group of backbench Tory MPs drawing up alternative proposals highlighting the benefits of a no-deal Brexit.An exclusive poll carried out by BMG Research this week found that 48 per cent of the public would now back a vote on any deal struck between the UK and the EU – up from 44 per cent just four weeks ago.Just 24 per cent opposed the idea, down three points over the same period. Only 14 per cent of the 1,500 people surveyed supported Ms May’s chequers deal given a choice.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final

Fatah aged 17 and was nominated for military training in Syria.Dated December 2016, the post states: “He joined in the planning of the Munich operation.”The post also sets out how Bseiso worked with “security officials like Ali Hassan Salameh”, who was operations chief for Black September, the group behind the Munich attack which left 11 Israeli athletes dead.It then records how Bseiso was killed at The Meridian Hotel in Paris in 1992, with Israeli intelligence organisation Mossad accused of the assassination.The tribute to Atef Bseiso on Fatah\u0027s official Facebook pageLabour leader Jeremy

near a plaque honouring Palestinians linked to Black September, the terrorist group behind Munich.The Labour leader said he only laid a wreath in memory of victims of a 1985 Israeli air strike on a Palestinian base in Tunisia, and while he admitted being “present” while a wreath was laid in honour of those linked to Black September, including Atef Bseiso, he said he did not “think” he had done so himself.\u0026nbspLabour has since insisted that those who perpetrated the Munich atrocity are not even buried in the cemetery, and have used the argument as part of their complaint to

For many women and their partners, a miscarriage means the loss of a baby and the hopes and the dreams for that child,” she told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“It would give people the time out you need when you have been bereaved. It acknowledges a miscarriage is a significant event and this is even true for people who don’t take the leave.”She said the discussion the proposed bill had provoked\u0026nbspwas helping to reduce the taboo which surrounds miscarriages.\u0026nbspSome other countries have provisions for paid leave if a woman miscarries. Indian law instructs that women are eligible to six weeks’ leave if they miscarry a baby. However, the overwhelming majority of employees in the country carry out informal work so not many are entitled to it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/18/11/egyptian-agriculture.jpg","title":"old cheese egypt tomb ancient history curse ptahmes memphis","story":"Created with Sketch.Ancient cheese was\u0026nbspincluded in the feasts buried alongside wealthy Egyptians and\u0026nbspprobably had similar\u0026nbspconsistency to\u0026nbspgoats cheeseClick to followThe Independent Online The mysterious white substance discovered in a group of broken jars could be one of the oldest solid specimens of cheese ever foundA few years ago, a team of archaeologists cleaning sand from an ancient Egyptian tomb discovered a group of broken jars, one of them containing a mysterious white substance.A new analysis published in the journal Analytical Chemistry suggests that what\u0026nbspthey found during that excavation was an approximately 3,200-year-old piece of cheese, one of the oldest solid specimens discovered.“The archaeologists suspected it was food, according to the conservation method and the position of the finding inside the tomb, but we discovered it was cheese after the first tests,” Enrico Greco, the lead author of the paper and a research assistant at Peking University in Beijing, said in an email.The tomb in which the cheese was found belonged to Ptahmes, a high-ranking Egyptian official in the 13th century BC\u0026nbspand the former mayor of the ancient city of Memphis, according to the paper.His burial site was first unearthed in 1885, but was lost to shifting sands until its rediscovery in 2010.The ancient cheese, which was sometimes included in the feasts buried alongside wealthy Egyptians, was probably similar in consistency to chevre, or goats cheese, but with a “really, really acidy” bite, according to Paul Kindstedt, a professor at the University of Vermont who studies the chemistry and history of cheese.“It would be high in moisture, it would be spreadable,” he said. “It would not last long, it would spoil very quickly.”Black sarcophagus found in Egypt is finally openedEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesAnd while the sample retrieved by Mr Greco’s colleagues may be old, others have discovered traces of ancient cheese or yoghurt (the two can be difficult to distinguish) that long predate even the recent finding, Mr\u0026nbspKindstedt said.“Other groups have done a lot of work with extracting lipid residues, fat residues, from ancient pots going back as far as 7000 BC,” he said.In 1942, a team of researchers reported a finding not dissimilar to that of Mr Greco and his colleagues, Mr Kindstedt pointed out.In a journal article, they described finding a substance in ancient Egyptian jars that they suspected to be cheese dating back to 3200 BC. The samples, they wrote, had “no smell and only a dusty taste.”But even if the cheese Mr Greco tested isn’t the oldest ever found, the findings stand out for another reason: the application of a state-of-the-art protein analysis.“As I say to my students every year when I get to Egypt, someone has to go ahead and analyse these residues with modern capabilities,” said Mr Kindstedt, who added that he plans to use Mr Greco’s paper in his teachings this autumn. “This is a logical next step and I think you’re going to see a lot more of this.”In their analysis, Mr Greco and his colleagues found hundreds of peptides, or chains of amino acids. Most were human and represented skin and saliva contamination, but, crucially, nine were linked to bovine or ovine milk.Adventurous eaters be warned: The cheese may not be cursed, but the analysis found evidence of a bacteria that causes brucellosis, an infectious disease that can cause fevers, headaches, muscle pain and other symptoms that can reoccur or never go away at all.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/15/senator.jpg","title":"australian senator fraser anning final solution muslim immigration","story":"Created with Sketch.Crossbencher Fraser Anning widely condemned for his isive remarksClick to followIndy PoliticsAn Australian politician has provoked outrage after using the term “final solution” in an incendiary\u0026nbspspeech about immigration, in which he called for a plebiscite asking voters whether they want to stop\u0026nbspMuslims and those “from the third world” from entering the country.Queensland senator Fraser Anning’s provocative maiden speech called for an immigration program that favours “European Christian” values, claiming it would protect Australia from potential terror attacks.We as a nation are entitled to insist that those who are allowed to come here predominantly reflect the historic European-Christian composition of Australian society, the Katter’s Australian Party upper house MP said.Trump isn’t the only one whose immigration policy is doomed to failLaura Ingraham defends her immigration comments, disavows David DukeIf Trump got his way, Melania\u0027s parents would be illegal immigrantsMr Anning, who replaced Malcolm Roberts in the Senate back in June, called for “a plebiscite to allow the Australian people to decide whether they want wholesale non-English speaking immigrants from the third world, and particularly whether they want any Muslims”.“The majority of Muslims in Australia of working age do not work and exist on welfare. Muslims in New South Wales and Victoria are three times more likely than other groups to be convicted of crimes, he claimed.\u0026nbsp“We have black African Muslim gangs terrorising Melbourne, we have Isis-sympathising Muslims trying to go overseas to try and fight for Isis and while all Muslims are not terrorists, certainly all terrorists these days are Muslims.“So why would anyone want to bring more of them here?”He went on to state\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspmigrates should learn the English language and embrace Australian values.“Ethnocultural ersity ... has been allowed to rise to dangerous levels in many suburbs, he said.In direct response, self-segregation, including white flight from poorer inner-urban areas, has become the norm.World news in picturesMuslim pilgrims walk out after the Friday prayer at the Grand mosque ahead of annual Haj pilgrimage in the holy city of Mecca, Saudi ArabiaA man wades through flooded water in Kochi, Kerala state, India.

Best supplements for diabetes - three of the best capsules                Diabetes type 2: Why you should never ignore this \u0026lsquosurprising\u0026rsquo symptomConsultant cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra said: \u0026ldquoBritain\u0026rsquos junk food epidemic is killing our children.This should be a wake-up call for major Government intervention. Enough is enough.There needs to be a huge crackdown on the marketing of junk food across all platforms and a complete dissociation between celebrities and sports stars and the endorsement of crisps, chocolate and breakfast cereals, which has only exacerbated the crisis.Latest figures from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health show 715 people under the age of 25 received care for Type 2 diabetes in units in England and Wales, of which 78.6 per cent were also obese. The figures for 201617 are an increase of 41 per cent on the 507 cases from 201314.A host of supermarkets regularly advertise promotions aimed at children (Image: )Kathryn Kirchner, clinical adviser at Diabetes UK, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely worrying.We are seeing more young people develop Type 2 year on year. \u0026ldquoAlthough there are a number of risk factors which are out of our control, one of the most important is being overweight or obese, which we are able to influence.\u0026ldquoThese figures are a stark reminder that we have a collective responsibility to push for the actions outlined in the Government\u0026rsquos childhood obesity plan, including clearer and more consistent food labelling.There is already a sugar tax on some soft drinks but health campaigners say it should be extended to food, and those drinks not subject to the levy, such as milkshakes which can contain as much as 16 teaspoons of sugar.A host of supermarkets regularly advertise promotions aimed at children with a family pack of chocolate shakes available for just \u0026pound1.Despite there being 15g of fat and 4g of sugar in a Big Mac burger, McDonald\u0026rsquos has been a key commercial partner of the Football Association for 15 years.

Half of new diabetes victims are under 35Earlier this year the FA renewed its long-standing partnership with confectionary giant Mars, which is now the official supporter of the England men\u0026rsquos, women\u0026rsquos and disability teams.Campaigners want all labelling of added sugars to be marked in teaspoons rather than grams, all sugary drinks advertising \u0026ndash including fruit juice \u0026ndash on TV and internet demand services outlawed, and companies associated with sugary products to be banned from sponsoring sporting events. Birmingham is Britain\u0026rsquos diabetes capital, where one in 10 have the disease.Dr Jyoti Baharani, a kidney specialist at the city\u0026rsquos Heartlands Hospital, said: \u0026ldquoDiabetes ravages the system.It affects the heart, blood vessels, kidneys and is unremitting, unrelenting, it just carries on. \u0026ldquoYou always think patients have a limited life because there\u0026rsquos only so much you\u0026rsquoll be able to do for them. The Local Government Association revealed 22,000 children are classed as severely obese when they leave primary school.Last night it said ministers should reverse the \u0026pound600million cut to councils\u0026rsquo public health funding, which is used to fi ght obesity. LGA spokeswoman Councillor Izzi Seccombe said: \u0026ldquoThese figures are a sad indictment of how we have collectively failed as a society to tackle childhood obesity, one of the biggest health challenges we face.Type 2 typically develops in adults over the age of 40, so it is extremely worrying that we are seeing more young people develop the condition.\u0026ldquoThe Government\u0026rsquos childhood obesity plan sets out bold ambitions to halve the number of obese children by 2030. But we need urgent action now. \u0026ldquoThese figures will only multiply if we delay.Diabetes costs the NHS more than \u0026pound10billion a year.There are three times the number of diabetes cases as all cancer cases.McDonald\u0026rsquos has been a key commercial partner of the Football Association for 15 years. (Image: )Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: \u0026ldquoTheresa May\u0026rsquos recently published strategy is nowhere near as bold and ambitious as Councillor Seccombe would have you believe.It\u0026rsquos full of ambitions but contains little of the action that she demands. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos monstrous to consider but some of these children could be dead by the end of the decade. The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u0026ldquoWe know the damage obesity causes and are determined to halve childhood obesity by 2030.We have invested billions in public health services and have already removed the equivalent of 45 million kilograms of sugar from soft drinks every year.Our new childhood obesity plan will now get children exercising more in schools and reduce their exposure to sugary and fatty foods.

He says he was told that he couldn’t speak at the wedding and that Harry berated him on the phone for mishandling the Press while he was recovering from a heart attack.The official royal response to these outbursts has been, effectively, to shove their fingers in their ears and shout la-la-la (or lah-lah-lah).The snobby courtiers and hangers-on dismiss Markle père as fame-hungry.That’s not altogether wrong — he is clearly desperate, as he proved by posing for snaps with the paparazzi in the run-up to the wedding.But it’s not good enough to wish he’d just go away.Meghan is now one of the most photographed and sought-after women in the world. Her very well-paid PR flunkies should have seen these familial landmines a mile off and defused them.But they have failed.Thomas Markle is a difficult and proud man, no doubt. But that is why he should have been treated with care, not frozen out.Why did Team Windsor not find him a role and approach him long before the wedding to make sure he didn’t feel excluded.It’s hard not to feel for him.His ex, Meghan’s mother Doria, was hailed as one of the stars of the wedding.Because she’s a black woman, she invited lots of gushing commentary about the monarchy becoming more diverse and modern.Amen to that. But poor old podgy Thomas, an awkward-looking white bloke, has been shunned from his daughter’s nuptials. You can’t blame him for speaking out.The royal courtiers enjoy the adulation the monarchy receives because Prince Harry has been “brave” enough to marry a woman with a complicated background.But the Palace spin machine freaks out when it comes to confronting the reality of Meghan’s parentage.Perhaps they just find it too vulgar.Harry’s PR man is Jason Knauf, an American specialist in “crisis management” having worked for Royal Bank of Scotland. He excels at sending angry letters to journalists he feels have gone too far snooping into Harry and Meghan’s private lives.But he doesn’t seem to have a clue as to how to handle his clients’ grumpy relatives.As a result, the monarchy is facing arguably its worst crisis since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.We are often told how brilliant the Royal Family’s PR is. Part of the new royal spin, in fact, is about how great the royals now are at spin. They have “rebranded” the monarchy for the 21st century, and so on.Look at the blizzard of positive guff accompanying Prince William, Kate, and Harry’s campaign for mental illness last year.They were, it was said, making the younger Windsors seem more touchy-feely.At the moment, however, they don’t seem sensitive enough to speak to Meghan’s suffering in-laws.That’s not what you’d call a good look.The truth is, royal press officers have long got too much credit.The British admire the Queen because she is admirable.Overall, we prefer monarchy to any other system of government. That’s just common sense. It’s nothing to do with any ingenious branding and media strategy.The public also feels that the younger royals deserve a chance.At a time when our country is consumed by Brexit and political arguments, the wedding of Harry and Meghan came as a blessed relief — something we could all celebrate.The couple both came from broken homes, and nobody cared so long as they were happy. That’s all great.   But it’s obvious that Meghan has, as one royal expert put it, “background baggage that needs unpacking”.Insiders now say the treatment of the Markle family has been a “shambles”.This is before we consider the potential PR bombshells that could erupt if and when Meghan’s ex-husband, Trevor Engelson, decides to grant some interviews.The British don’t want to see the monarchy turned into a reality TV soap, as the Markles and Windsors wage a media war with each other.It’s trashy and embarrassing.But unless the Palace can tackle Meghan’s disgruntled kin, that’s exactly what is happening.Maybe we need a changing of the royal PR guard — before it’s too late.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the party will look at this I am sure extremely forcefully at the next conference.Lets wait and see what conference decides.“Theres always a rule in politics: if youre on the front pages for too long you become the story and thats not good because you miss all the good and effective things that the Labour Party is doing in terms of policy and holding this government to account.”Host Julia Hartley-Brewer asked her: “Do you think that a man who lays wreaths at the tombs of terrorists who have killed innocent people is fit to be the British Prime Minister?”But Ms Moon would only reply: “That will be a decision for the British people.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yesterdays employment figures revealed that the proportion of young people unemployed (and not in full-time education) is now at a record low of 4.7% for our country - and far lower than for many other developed countries.It sends a significant message out about the drive and innovation of our young people, and the opportunities that our economy offers to them and their future.With our welfare changes this country can now be powered forward by this young generation.Since 2010, youth unemployment has fallen by over 45%, giving 130,000 more young people a job, and a future.Add the fact that wages are on the up and there are more than 829,000 vacancies nationwide, it’s clear that young people are entering the best jobs market in a decade.On average, the number of vacancies has increased by 4,280 each month over the last year, and those vacancies span from construction to technology.So when young people this week are deciding on their next steps, they can think big as there are plenty of opportunities out there for them, from a job with career progression, to taking up an apprenticeship.Look at Daisy, who turned down five university offers to work at global engineering firm JCB designing new equipment, and she didn’t have to go to university to get there.I’m forever being told, and intrinsically understand, that people want to study at different times in their lives, often inspired to do so when they see the practical benefits of their studies.That’s why so many people prefer, and do better, getting a job first and then studying for exams while they work.Even over the last few decades, how the world of education and work are linked has shifted dramatically. People no longer have one job for life, and lifelong learning is becoming more and more commonplace as people dip in and out of education.Many more people up-skill and retrain throughout their career – and this is how the future jobs market will remain vibrant and strong.And when I speak to employers up and down the country, from manufacturers to marketers, what they want are young people with the right attitude, prepared to work and learn. As they say, ‘if you’ve the will, we can give you the skill’.So when young people this week are deciding their next steps, the academic route isn’t the only option.You can now become a solicitor, an accountant or even a nuclear engineer through the apprenticeship route, earning as you learn and without the cost of going to University. Studying a Higher Apprenticeship gives an average wage boost of £150,000 over a working life.When I speak to young people around the country, I’m impressed with the confidence and self-assuredness with which they look to the future, and the range of options they consider beyond traditional routes.Im certainly no job snob. Life teaches you its not where you come from, its where you get to, and work is exactly the same.You can start anywhere and get to the top as Im repeatedly being told by our countrys top entrepreneurs.Top performers in their fields such as Debbie Moore, Jean-Christophe Novelli, Deborah Meaden and Jo Malone, did not go to university and are just a handful of the individuals who show that with drive and determination you can succeed by treading your own path.Its all about getting a break and taking the opportunities that come your way.So best of luck to everyone today, but whatever your results, there are many opportunities and pathways into a successful career.    Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There could be something else going on.”Dr Lee ordered an MRI scan, which shows there is a deposit of fat inside Taylors spinal cord.She offered to remove some of the bump to make it more aesthetically pleasing, but warned the procedure could disrupt Taylors spinal cord.“Even tugging on this lipoma in any way could potentially disrupt the growth within the spinal cord, and I dont want to do that in any way,” Dr Pimple Popper added.“By staying as superficial as possible Im able to shape this well and make sure it looks good without really disrupting it.”When the removal is complete, Dr Lee sews Taylor up with two to three times the normal amount of stitches to make sure the incision heals correctly.Afterwards Taylor revealed she has decided to see a neurosurgeon to see if its possible for her lipoma to be completely removed.“Im ecstatic about my results. Since my surgery with Dr Lee I feel more confident,” she said.“When I lost a part of Lizzie, there was a lot lifted off my shoulders.”A lipoma is a benign, fatty lump that grows under the skin.Theyre harmless and can usually be left alone if theyre small and painless.They are non-cancerous and are caused by an overgrowth of fat cells.Lipomas can grow anywhere on the body, but are most common on the shoulders, neck, chest, arms, back, bum and thighs.They grow very slowly and dont usually cause any problems.Lipomas dont usually need to be removed unless theyre causing problems, such as pain, or if theres uncertainty about whether its a lipoma.However it can be removed if it is large or is in an obvious place and is affecting your self-esteem.You should always see your GP if you develop a growth or swelling on your body."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427138495.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"inside vietnams sickening bear bile farms where animals are kept in cramped filthy conditions before having their gallbladders removed for use in traditional medicine","story":"To add to their misery, many of the captive animals are being left to starve or killed outright as consumer demand swings towards bile from wild bears.Now the race is on to rescue as many bears as possible and take them to sanctuaries.In one instance, two moon bears were rescued from cramped cages where they have been held for 13 years.Rescuers checked their rotten teeth and matted paws before sending them to their new home in northern Vietnam.The animals are among the lucky few as hundreds of their fellows are feared to have been slaughtered as the cost of once-valuable farmed bile plummets.Bear bile is extracted, often continuously and painfully, in Vietnam, where the illegal practice remains widespread.Wild bear bile can cost 12 times more, and farmers can no longer earn what they used to from the illicit trade.If consumer demand for wild bear gallbladders continues to rise it could spell the end for wild bears, which are killed for the sought-after organ.The trend is also bad news for caged bears, whose owners can no longer afford to keep them alive.Brian Crudge, research programme manager at Free The Bears, told Channel News Asia: Farmers said it wasnt profitable to keep the bears any more so they started feeding them less and let them die off.The number of captive bears has dropped dramatically since 2005 from about 4,500 to less than 800 today, according to official data.With about 200 bears in Vietnams rescue centres, he said many likely starved to death or were killed off and sold for their body parts.Bear paws are popularly used as a delicacy in soup or liquor, while bones are used for cooking and teeth and claws for decoration or jewellery.Crudge said: Its quite urgent, we want to get as many of them as we can before its too late.Some farmers - who can legally keep bears as pets but are not allowed to extract bile - have started handing over their bears voluntarily.One farmer said he used to earn £8 for one millilitre of farmed bile, but now only makes about £1.50.The anonymous farmer said: People dont seem to like the bile anymore so its harder to find customers.He used to keep about a dozen bears in cages at his home and now has none, but just smiled when asked when happened to them, refusing to elaborate.Vietnam has come under fire for failing to crack down on the illegal trade, but in a landmark decision last year said it would abolish all bear farms by 2022.It is likely to meet that goal, but not all will make it into sanctuaries with death rates likely to remain steady.However, a fortunate few will, like Hoa Lan and Hoa Tra, who were sent to a rescue centre in Ninh Binh province this week.After being rescued from the farm where they have lived since 2005, they will spend a few weeks in quarantine before being allowed to frolic in the grass with their fellow rescuees - which will require some courage after so many years in a cage.Emily Lloyd, animal manager at Four Paws Vietnam, which runs the sanctuary, said: Its pretty scary for them at first.It can take several weeks until theyre brave enough to go around the enclosure."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427209741.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"teacher discovers burglar behind 7k raid on her home is her neighbour after turning detective","story":"Zoe Bloodworth, 32, caught Ross Peters after spotting him wearing a Superdry jacket she recognised from CCTV footage of the break-in in Kempston, Beds.Peters, 41, has now been jailed for 27 months at Luton Crown Court for the burglary in January this year.Following the sentencing, Zoe said she first realised his identity while asking neighbours for help in solving the crime.She said: It actually clicked as he was walking towards me -

claiming it would make them more loyal to Jeremy Corbyn.Mr Williamson, the MP for Derby North, is in the middle of a two-month tour of England speaking to local branches of hard-left pressure group Momentum.At every meeting hes been drumming up support for mandatory reselection - which would give local Labour activists an iron-clad veto over whether their MPs are allowed to stand for re-election.Speaking in Plymouth last week, he said that reselection would stop a repeat of the 2016 coup against Mr Corbyn by centrist MPs who tried to replace him with Owen Smith.Mr Williamson said: Why are people so fearful of democracy? If youre doing a good job, if youre responsive to your members, then youre going to get reselected, arent you?If youre not, if youre railing against your leader, if you are disregarding your members, then members might take a different view.He added: It leads to a coup where the leader has got the biggest political mandate of any leader in this country, theres an attempt by the Westminster elites to kick him out.If people were concerned about the possibility of maybe losing their nomination through an open selection, it might just concentrate their minds a bit.The veteran leftist insisted the purpose of his democracy roadshow wasnt to campaign for deselections - but went on to name four of moderate MPs hed like to see gone.Mr Williamson said: Theres a few people I would like to see deselected - but its not up to me.I mean, if it was theyd be gone tomorrow, in fact theyd be gone yesterday. But its up to the members in each and every constituency.He continued: Im not suggesting theres going to be wholesale deselections - its not a deselection tour, contrary to what some people are saying about it or trying to characterise it as.Even though we are going to people like Chuka Umunnas seat, and Chris Leslies, and Neil Coyles, and Wes Streetings constituency.The four MPs named are all fierce critics of Mr Corbyn who have recently savaged his stance on Brexit.Mr Leslie, MP for Nottingham East, mocked Mr Williamson and suggested he was just trying to curry favour with the Labour leadership.He told The Sun: Chris should spend less time trying to get a job in the Shadow Cabinet and more time in his own Derby constituency where the Tories have been doing well in his absence.Mr Williamson quit as shadow fire minister in January after repeatedly calling for Mr Corbyn to enact even more extreme left-wing policies.And he has repeatedly stood up for leftie activists whove been thrown out of Labour following anti-Semitism claims."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000159739694-e1534531485294.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"madonna best at being madge","story":"She might have had a bit of assistance to retain such a fresh-faced youthfulness, but the body is all her own work.Through hours of  gym graft and sheer willpower she’s even more bendy now than when she first burst on to the scene back in 1984 warbling Holiday in a Minnie Mouse falsetto.Madonna is the biggest-selling female artist ever, shifting 300million albums and is worth around 454million quid.She’s achieved success on her own terms and been a trailblazer for every other successful female act following in her wake. There would be no Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus or arguably Lady Gaga without Madonna.She might not be the best singer or dancer in the world, but she’s certainly the best at just being Madonna.You simply can’t imagine anyone ever telling her what to do. She’d laugh in their face.Madonna had always known how to grab attention, whether it’s publishing a book stuffed full of naked photos of herself, faking self-pleasure on stage, or kissing Britney Spears.And only Madonna could have bounced back from almost being strangled by her bright red Armani cape when she took a tumble and fell on her backside during the Brit Awards three years ago.She merely dusted herself down and carried on regardless, but I bet whoever was in charge of her wardrobe that night would have been given the b******ing of their life.Madonna is always in charge, professionally and personally. Even during her brief fling with aging lothario Warren Beatty, he was very much a bit player in the Madonna Show.That must have badly bruised the ego of a man who had always had the upper-hand in his relationships until then.It has to be said her love life hasn’t been anywhere near as successful as her career.There was a brief, destructive marriage to American actor Sean Penn in the Eighties and in 2000 she married Guy Ritchie, but the couple divorced eight years later.Since then she has dated a string of handsome and often young men, but they usually seemed to have the whiff of a photo opportunity about them rather than anything long term.She chews them up, spits them out and moves on to the next one.Madonna seems happiest as a single mum.She has uprooted the family to Lisbon, in Portugal,  because her adopted son David wants to play professional football.With her vast wealth she could easily have bought him a team such as LA Galaxy but she has always had a Calvinistic work ethic that she has tried to pass on to her kids.She has also made up with son Rocco Ritchie after a bitter custody battle and appears to be in a very good place.In an era where most young female vocalists all sound the same — bored, whiny and more than a wee bit yodelly — we really do need a one-off like Madonna.I hope she had a fabulous birthday on Thursday in Marrakech, Morocco, and danced until dawn to all of her greatest hits.Happy 60th birthday, ma’am, and I’ve no doubt you will still be in your fishnets and basques when you get that 100-year birthday message.Just when the royals and their advisers thought the whole fiasco between Meghan Markle and her dad had gone quiet, there comes a bizarre twist.Meghan’s rent-a-gob half-sister Samantha, who seethes with rage and jealousy, has announced that Thomas Markle is bringing out his own clothing range.This led to speculation as to what the brand might be called.  “Markle \u0026amp Spencer” or “Primarkles”  (thank you, Alan Carr). But joking aside, surely this can’t be a serious  concept.Apart from being a crass, money-grabbing exercise cashing in on a quasi-royal connection, who on earth would buy garments from a pensioner who dresses like a hobo?I’ve had a great deal of sympathy for Thomas  in the past. He was treated poorly in the build-up to the  Royal Wedding, when his daughter married Prince Harry.He should have been embraced by his new family and given guidance on how to deal with the  media attention.Instead he was cast adrift. The result? Those stupid paparazzi set-up photos and a series of interviews that painted Meghan in a poor light.Every time her dad talks on TV or to newspapers and magazines, her popularity is dented.The two of them obviously have a fraught relationship. It turns out Thomas didn’t attend Meghan’s first wedding in 2011 either.Thomas increasingly comes across as bitter, angry and dislikable.To gain media attention he keeps making more and more outrageous accusations.My advice would be to stop listening to his bitchy daughter Samantha and maintain a dignified silence.All thoughts of profiteering through a clothing range or any commercial activity must be abandoned forthwith.That just might mean there could be some  sort of reconciliation in the future.Otherwise he will lose his daughter forever.ONE of the week’s most astonishing stories involved a young US woman who has been given her life back with a groundbreaking face transplant.Three years ago, Katie Stubblefield, from Mississippi in the US, tried to take her own life and shot herself in the face with a hunting rifle. She was just 18.Doctors saved her life but she was left with a mass of scar tissue instead of a face.Katie, the youngest person ever to receive a face transplant, endured more than 30 hours of surgery.Of course, the operation requires a donor – and in this case it is  a very sad story.Katie received the face  of a mum who died of a drug overdose.She was a registered organ donor and her grandmother bravely approved the donation.That decision can’t have been easy and we should always salute those who are donors, and the loved ones who give their consent.Katie won’t look like anything like her donor because the “face” is moulded on to her new bone structure.She continues to heal and  make progress, but this kind of surgery is still in its infancy.She will always look “different” but she has a second chance of life and now wants to help others in anguish and with suicidal thoughts.It’s an incredible story of despair that turned to  hope.  The skill and dedication of the team of surgeons and medics that helped her is awe-inspiring.I’m always surprised to learn that Caroline Flack is 38 years old.The presenter looks a  lot younger – and at the moment she is acting like a lovesick teenager going through the agony and ecstasy of her first serious crush.Her off/on romance with red carpet fever victim Andrew Brady is becoming laughable.This week the couple apparently had yet another spat in a London ­restaurant.If these two are to have any chance of staying together long term, they need to get out of the public eye and spend some quiet time alone.I’m sure Caroline knows of a certain Love Island that isn’t being used right now. That would do very well.The ending of the second series of The Handmaid’s Tale had me shouting in despair at my TV.I don’t want to give away too many spoilers but this cliffhanger will break your heart.It also, however, sets up season three for long overdue revenge.As always, astonishing performances from Elisabeth Moss as  June/Ofglen and Yvonne Strahovski as Serena Joy.They will soon fight it out for real when the TV actress awards are up for grabs.I’ve lost track of the amount of slippers our border terrier puppy Angus has chewed up, but this week he surpassed himself by getting his paws on his Pet Passport and virtually destroying it when we were in Spain.Luckily a  local vet issued him with a Spanish version and he now boasts dual nationality.He’s suddenly developed a liking for an afternoon siesta, but at least we were able to get him back into the UK – although who knows what will happen to him after Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has to be registered and declared when he spoke. Paisley got 30 days for the same offence.”Mr Corbyn’s office did not respond to a request for comment last night.He has refused to come clean over the costs of the controversial trip.He said he didn’t declare it in the register of MPs’ interests because it fell below the then £660 threshold for which MPs must declare hospitality they’ve received.But revelations in The Sun earlier that he stayed in a luxury 5-star hotel during the trip challenged these claims.Last night a Labour party spokesman claimed Mr Corbyn was not obligated to disclose his trip in the Palestine debate.The spokesman said: “The cost of Jeremy’s trip did not meet the threshold requiring it to be declared.

Jeremy did not honour those responsible for the Munich killings”.Holding a wreath should not be reckoned to be any kind of endorsement of the wreath we know Jeremy deplores this kind of thing and, indeed, all other forms of wreath.Hark, though, at how quickly the approved line may shift. What was a “smear” yesterday is a forgotten truth today, airbrushed from history because, well, that’s the way these people do these things.The new line is Jeremy wants to see “a fitting memorial to everyone who died in every terrorist incident everywhere”.I dare say he’ll be visiting Enniskillen soon. Of course.And yet, in one sense there really isn’t very much to look at. Or, rather, very little that is new. This is who Corbyn is and who he has always been.He has never bothered hiding this, leaving one to assume he only does so now because there is some small, nagging part of his brain which accepts it might be sensible to do so, since failing to hide it might prove politically inconvenient.Even so, he cannot change. Anyone who has been at university will recognise Corbyn and all his fellow travellers.These were the people — some of them clever but not many of them intelligent — who fouled student politics for everyone else.The chiselling parsers and pedants and revolutionaries whose appetite for procedural minutiae bored everyone else into submission.And usually that would be that. They would, most of them, grow up eventually. But not St Jeremy and not his devotional disciples, either.They are greyer now but as instantly recognisable as they always were: Experts in room-clearing.They ought, by rights, to be confined to dingy rooms above down-at-heel pubs, where they could cut and paste their thuddingly dreary newsletters. Instead, mystifyingly, they have been given control of one of Britain’s great political parties.How much will this summer of anti-Semitism really cut through with the average voter? Less than you might think, I suspect.In the first place — and this may be a good thing — Twitter remains a niche platform and political Twitter a niche even there.Secondly, the public have already made up their minds about Corbyn and they think he’s a dud.Each month YouGov asks whether Jeremy Corbyn or Theresa May seems the best available Prime Minister and each month Corbyn trails.Sometimes he is also beaten by “Don’t know”. That’s Corbyn: He can come third in a two-horse race.But, they splutter, look at what a kind and gentle and decent man he is. Why can’t other people see that he’s a valiant activist for peace?Possibly because, for a decent fellow, he spends a startling amount of time with thoroughly indecent people.He keeps falling in with the wrong crowd while never being a member of the wrong crowd himself. There is no need here to document the long list of unsavoury people with whom Corbyn has been happy to associate himself because, really, what is now the point? He is who he is and we know who he is.In Corbyn’s world every-thing has a single, simple explanation. Colonialism is the root cause of all root causes.That insight — if we can call it that — dictated his views on Ireland just as it dictates his views on the Middle East, Cuba, Venezuela and everywhere else.From there it is but a short leap to the kind of deluded wishful thinking that animates what passes for his thinking. Once you have assumed that Northern Ireland should not exist, you absolve yourself of any and all need to think about what should happen next.You may ignore the inconvenient, and stubborn, reality that Northern Ireland — like, well, Israel — does exist and is not going to disappear.Practical politics means wrestling with things as they are, not as you think they should have been decades previously.But if you start with the theory, you may avoid practical reality. If this leaves you with nothing — precisely nothing — useful to say then so be it. You will at least remain pure in heart.If this means you are no kind of “peace campaigner” at all, that’s fine too, because you will be shielded by your own impenetrable sanctimony.As poses go, this is an awfully comfortable one but it’s not serious politics.Perhaps Corbyn really is just unlucky. But it seems more probable that he’s not. And that, far from being the decent man of legend he’s actually thoroughly indecent.The only possible alternative is that he’s thunderously, crushingly, toe-curlingly thick.On balance, however, it seems more probable that he is, in fact, both.Enough of this. Enough, already.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250 or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Retailers and producers would be hit for using or making “virgin plastics”.The crackdown comes after a record 162,000 responses from the public to the Government’s consultation on how to reduce single-use plastics and boost recycling.Treasury minister Robert Jenrick said: “There was clear support for a new incentive for businesses to use recycled plastics over new plastics when producing packaging — such as takeaway boxes or water bottles.“This is about using the tax system intelligently to encourage manufacturers and retailers to take more responsibility for the products that end up in shops.”Campaigners welcomed the move to place the burden for recycling on businesses.GOT a story?

Well, you must have been getting your news from the BBC, then.This was the latest example of Corbyn simpering around terrorists. Honouring scumbags who massacred 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich.The Black September gangsters castrated their male victims while they were still alive.But then, Corbyn was happy to attend the funerals of dead IRA terrorists. That’s the kind of chap he is. Actually, I say that was the “latest” case of Corbyn simpering around terrorists.Not quite. A day or two later a photo emerged of him giving the salute of the Muslim Brotherhood, a foul organisation proscribed as terrorists in six countries.And it’s all part of the anti-Semitism scandal which is tearing the Labour Party apart. An important story.Good people have left Labour as a consequence. The Jewish community in the UK is in uproar.Frightened of the far Left’s support for vile Islamists and its loathing of Israel and its right to exist.Scared of the morons who now lead Labour and its retinue of lefties who have said the most appalling, racist, stuff about Jews.Jeremy Corbyn, a genuine halfwit, thinks it is all “fake news”.He rolls his eyes when asked about it and gives different answers every time he is questioned.And guess who agrees with him? Yep, the BBC.The corporation refused to touch the story for a whole day, when it was first reported by blogger Guido Fawkes. Ignored it.Everyone else — including the left-wing  — thought it important.Instead, the front page of the BBC’s online news carried no fewer than SIX stories about former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and the allegations of Islamophobia made against him. Six!Boris had likened women who wear the burka to letter boxes or bank robbers.The vast majority of the country agreed that he wasn’t being racist. The vast majority want the burka banned here — as it is in Denmark, France, parts of Germany, Belgium and . . . Morocco.His comments were not much of a story at all. And the moves to sanction him solely a case of his enemies in the Conservative Party gleefully hammering the bloke.But the BBC became obsessed by it. It is always obsessed when the word Islamophobia is mentioned.And it loves to stick the boot into the Tories. Yet was utterly silent on the latest example of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.It took them a full day to even mention the story.It’s another shocking case of the BBC’s bias. A left-liberal prejudice which runs right through the corporation from top to bottom.The same prejudice you hear whenever it deals with immigration (bloody marvellous!) or Brexit (absolutely ghastly!).Haven’t we had enough of this? Enough of paying £150.50 every year to have these credulous dupes pipe liberal propaganda into our homes every day.Get rid of the licence fee. Let the BBC survive through the subscriptions of those who are willing to pay. And on that deal, I’m out, Evan.Heres a photo of Rhian Sugden dressed as a plum.I’ve included it this week so that Tess Daly can enjoy it.Her husband, the uniquely interesting Vernon Kay, had a long sexting relationship with Rhian, apparently.And Tess was a bit hacked off.So maybe this will cheer her up.I’m on a diet. One of those low-carb things. God it’s boring.My favourite kinds of food are fat and carbohydrates, preferably mixed together.At night I dream of mashed potato and steak and kidney pudding.How can people enjoy life on a diet of bloody stir-fry?And the worst thing is it doesn’t seem to have done much for my weight. I still look like a pregnant middle-aged lesbian in a Boris Johnson wig.If the pounds don’t fall off soon I’m going to give it up. And BINGE.There’s a restaurant round my way that does a chicken parmo with a pizza on top.That’s where I’ll be heading.Freda Jackson, aged 81, did not enjoy her holiday and is demanding that the tour company refund her the full cost.Freda went on holiday to Spain and found herself surrounded by Spaniards...who wouldnt complain?Her complaint? The hotel she was staying in was “full of Spaniards”. Well, fair enough. They can be annoying. They get over-excited and spoil everyone’s fun.Where was Freda on holiday? Spain. Freda thinks she should have been warned about the possibility of being surrounded by Spaniards in Spain.She added that they should go “somewhere else” for their holidays.Brits are flooding to Turkey to take advantage of the crashing lira. You can get a holiday for two-fifths of nowt, apparently.All well and good. But you would have to pay me a lot of money to go anywhere near Turkey.The reason it’s cheap is because the moron who runs the place, Recep Erdogan has wrecked the economy. And there will be big trouble there soon.Fancy a change in your career plans? There’s a new job just come available – head of the Islamic State.The post is open to male psychopaths with very large beards. Must be able to scream “Allahu Akbar” in a very menacing manner. Salary negotiable.Small print at the bottom probably says: “The Islamic State is not an equal opportunities employer. So, no women, gays or Jews, please.”This job has come up because the previous leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi (Bob Baghdad to his mates) got hit in a drone strike. According to the Islamic State, he is now brain-dead. Hmmm. How could they tell?A year or so back I was in a minicab at night on my way home when we approached the level crossing near my house.The gates were open and the driver, a foreign bloke, drove into the middle, stopped and said: “Sorry, left or right?” I looked at him to see if he was joking.He wasn’t. I said: “I would go straight on if I were you.“This what we, in this country, call a ‘railway line’.” I assume it’s his wife, then, who was caught driving her car along the Newcastle  this week.And only noticed she was actually on a railway when she pulled up at a station.An art student decided to do something about the bright light coming in through her window.There are a number of solutions, aren’t there?Curtains, for example. Or maybe some nice blinds.But nope, instead she covered her window with a painting. It was called Double Anal Penetration and was quite, um, graphic.The neighbours kicked up a bit of a fuss.There was also the suggestion the police could be called. The student’s name, incidentally?

Stefanie Boyce looked on with profound honour as her beautiful nine-year-old daughter, Brooklyn, took her final breath last week after battling a rare condition. Just eight months earlier, she had watched her 11-year-old son, Jayden - Brooklyn\u0027s beloved older brother - pass away peacefully as he lay between her and her husband. The siblings had both lived courageously with the same rare and terminal disorder. And as Brooklyn neared the end of her short life, Stefanie found herself asking an unimaginable question that no mum or dad should ever be faced with. What parent has to think these thoughts, \u0027I wonder if my daughter\u0027s death will be as beautiful as my son\u0027s?\u0027, said the 37-year-old writer, from Illinois, US.  Referring to Brooklyn as \u0027B\u0027 and Jayden as \u0027J\u0027, she added: My greatest fear was B’s passing would be sudden and tragic. A seizure. A morning I’d find her not breathing. Some way that I couldn’t say good-bye. Some way not as holy or sacred as Jayden’s. But since her daughter\u0027s death, Stefanie has experienced a form of peace, knowing her two brave children are together again, playing in Heaven. B is probably dragging him around Heaven giving him the tour even though J knows his way around, she said in an emotional tribute to the pair. And I bet J is chuckling and going along with it as she does. It was on Monday, August 6, that Brooklyn received her crown of life, surrounded by her loved ones, including her dad, Justin, 38, and six-year-old sister, Ellie.  Also known as Beeba, the youngster had a contagious laugh and lit up every room with her personality - which was as big as her beautiful blonde hair. The same day of the week, on November 13 last year, her brother and best pal Jayden had gained his own crown, while lying peacefully between their parents. A gentle little boy who had a vibrant smile for everyone, he had loved dancing with his mum, playing with his dad and holding hands with Brooklyn and Ellie. Brooklyn and Jayden had both been \u0027brave warriors\u0027 against Sanfilippo Syndrome, a regressive metabolic disorder that affects around one in 70,000 children. Youngsters with the condition progress for a couple of years, before slowly losing the ability to walk, talk and eat. They typically pass away before they reach 20.  In Stefanie\u0027s tribute, which she gave  permission to share, she described how her and husband Justin\u0027s routine has all disappeared in one breath. We are no longer a special needs family, said the mum, whose youngest, Ellie, does not have the genetic disease. Our membership to the club got revoked. Expired. And although we never wanted to join, once we did, we didn’t want to leave. Beauty is found in its members. God is found in its meetings. Don’t get me wrong, we will stay connected as honorary members, but honorary none the less. But she added that there’s a peace now that comes as I envision J and B together. Maybe they’re laughing together because B just had to pass on the 6 and J on the 13, so they could share the Monday, she said.  But in true Beeba fashion, her Monday would be first. She concluded: I always wondered why two, but not anymore. Although their lives were short, Brooklyn and Jayden both helped to raise awareness of Sanfilippo Syndrome and the desperate need to find a cure. An obituary for Brooklyn describes how the little girl navigated the condition with strength, grace, and a smile as genuine as they come. She did so while impacting the lives of others. On the day of her daughter\u0027s death, Stefanie said it was her profound honour to have watched the youngster take her first and her last breath. Mourning and sadness feel just as right as joy. Brooklyn, you have brought joy to our life and to every life that has ever been touched by yours, she said.  Even in your last few breaths you made me smile in my tears. May I always strive to live as beautifully as you have. She added that she would be forever looking for her sweet girl. The day after Brooklyn\u0027s passing, Stefanie and Justin marked their 14th wedding anniversary. They spent part of it at a funeral home, planning their daughter\u0027s funeral. Brooklyn\u0027s life will be celebrated at Immanuel Church in Gurnee later this month. Although she and Jayden had suffered from Sanfilippo, the syndrome was not all of them and they didn\u0027t allow it to stop them from smiling and having fun. Their parents say their legacies will last for an eternity.  Stefanie\u0027s full tribute Together. There’s a weird feeling I have that my grief feels complete. There had been an anticipation of having to do this again and fear of what it would be like. My greatest fear was B’s passing would be sudden and tragic. A seizure. A morning I’d find her not breathing. Some way that I couldn’t say good-bye. Some way not as holy or sacred as Jayden’s. What parent has to think these thoughts, “I wonder if my daughter’s death will be as beautiful as my son’s?” I do. But, I’m not the only one. There was an incompleteness to my grief. Maybe that sounds wrong but it isn’t meant to. I certainly would have chosen another day of anticipation if it meant I could have B. It’s just J and B were always, J\u0026ampB. A package deal. It was always hard to separate them, even google photo gets it wrong. Of course they were individuals, too. J was sweet, B was spicy. J was patient, B was ...me. J was a runner, B was a singer.

That\u0027s the only word I can find to describe how her life panned out, what she achieved and what she meant. She lost her mother at 10, was pregnant by a school friend at 11, a mother at 12 and again at 15, daughter to a perverted superstar preacher who ran drug-and-sex orgies, and wife to a pimp who beat her. Singer Sam Cooke, a friend of her father\u0027s, is thought to have had sex with a 12-year-old Aretha when he was 23. Etta James, who died six years ago, was in the same congregation and said: I can understand Aretha not wanting to talk about that . . . Who wants to admit that you’re praising the Lord at the 8 p.m. service and servicing some drop-dead gorgeous hunk of a singer an hour later? Today, it\u0027s called child abuse. It\u0027s abandonment, vulnerable girls, predatory men, the most troubled and turbulent background it\u0027s possible to imagine. Yet through it Aretha reached - in the period after her mother died, she learned to play the piano by ear.  She went on the gospel circuit with her father, had her first two children and signed her first record deal. She almost signed to Tamla\u0027s motown label, which worked wonders for Diana Ross but would have buried Aretha\u0027s talent. She did better at Columbia, but in 1966 signed to the soul label Atlantic and hit the heights.  In February 1967 she released first single I Never Loved A Man. The B-side was Do Right Woman, Do Right Man. The B-side. In April she released her version of Otis Redding\u0027s Respect and in the space of just 3 months she was a megastar.  She did all that by the time she was 25, and with two children. She did it with a crappy childhood, sexual exploitation, and at a time when women and black women in particular were segregated, sidelined, and dehumanised. She did it because she reached back into her life, found the love and the pain, and hauled it up like Jonah wrestling his whale. Listen to her quiet, sad, dignified request for men to treat her kindly, and ask yourself who else could perform the same feat.  Aretha became a star for the same reason as Elvis Presley - she reached across the race divide. But while Elvis made black music acceptable by being a sexy white boy, Aretha showed that black and white both hurt the same. There\u0027s not a woman on the planet who doesn\u0027t want a Do Right Man, and after listening to that song, no man who doesn\u0027t want to do better. She sold 75million records to people who were not born in a wooden shack, weren\u0027t raised by perverts, had no interest in Baptist gospel and who nevertheless felt at one with her. When I was a teenager, she whispered in my ear about unrequited love. When I was a woman, she and I belted out songs about freedom and joy. When I fell in love we sang of our sweet, sweet baby, and when I was heartbroken, she raged with me about The House That Jack Built. And she winked at me and nodded when I changed our lyrics to demand he never came back. She was us. They were all our songs. And if she reached through it all, then we knew we could find the strength to do the same.  There is a moment in every one of her songs where you think she\u0027s given it all she can. Then she takes a breath, reaches, and finds some more. I don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s her diaphragm, her voice, or just plain magic but it elevates whoever hears it. Douglas Adams described Mark Knopfler as a man capable of making his guitar hoot and sing like angels on a Saturday night said there was a moment in every Dire Straits song where it is possible to fly. Well, Aretha sings like the angels\u0027 jaded, yet hopeful barmaid, and there is a point in every song where she lifts the weight of the world from everyone\u0027s shoulders. Her loved ones said she never sought help for her demons, never truly dealt with her drinking, gorging, and trips to mental clinics. Instead she went on stage. Perhaps if she had the help she deserved she would not have helped the rest of us realise we were not alone. She kept back the careers of her sisters, raged at friends, threw strops that would have embarrassed Henry VIII, but I don\u0027t care that she must have been hell to live with. With her, the rest of us had heaven on Earth.  She played piano like it was a percussion instrument. She arranged many of her own songs, and had the same natural talent for music that the rest of us do for breathing. But there\u0027s one story that tells you more about her than anything else.  In 1998 she was at the Grammys to perform her Blues Brothers version of Think, with John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. Her friend Luciano Pavarotti was due to perform Nessun Dorma, and despite rehearsing it perfectly he called in 30 minutes after the show began to say he had a cold and could no longer sing.  Aretha was asked to fill the gap, perhaps do one of her signature tracks. She asked instead to hear Pavarotti\u0027s rehearsal. Producer Ken Ehrlich said: In those days we had a boombox with a cassette. And I brought it to her and played it for her. When she heard it, she said, ‘Yeah, I can do this\u0027. She went out on stage, for a live, worldwide broadcast, with an orchestra she\u0027d not practised with, a choir she didn\u0027t know and a nervous conductor, and sang, in Italian, one of the most iconic and powerful songs in the world. One minute in, she reaches. Then reaches again, and again, and you\u0027re wowed, and somehow she reaches twice more and hits the final high note. Those final words, translated, are: At dawn, I will win. I will win, I will win!  At 16 Aretha had toured with Martin Luther King, and 10 years later sang at his funeral. She was rightly honoured and lauded throughout her later life, in 1987 she became the first woman inducted into the Rock\u0027n\u0027Roll Hall of Fame, and she even had an asteroid named after her. She\u0027s been called the greatest singer of all time, the voice of the civil rights movement, and much else besides. She was a spendthrift, a diva, and had a mink coat that she loved so much it used to have its own seat. Through it all, she remained an insecure little girl who thought she wasn\u0027t good enough. Still she reached for something more. More food, more drink, more men, more, more, more than this. And that\u0027s where her magic lay - the ability to show hope amid pain, to see potential in a poverty of experience. That is, after all, the thing that makes us human. We can rise, and when her voice soars it makes you feel that you have, and you can. If that\u0027s not soul, I don\u0027t know what is. In 2015 at a ceremony honouring songwriter Carol King, Aretha performed Natural Woman. She thumped those piano keys like they were in trouble, her voice hit the song at full speed, and Barack Obama wept 20 seconds after she\u0027d opened her mouth. Halfway through, she stands up and reaches for a high note as the auditorium gives her a standing ovation. She throws that mink coat to the floor, and finds more. She goes on, and up, and up, and there\u0027s nothing the audience can do but clap harder. She was a natural woman. She made us feel what it was like to be her, and to be us, and to be human. She showed us what soul was, and she\u0027ll never stop because that voice will never be silent. My daughter will grow up with Aretha in her ears, feeling that they two alone share a secret. You make us feel, Aretha. You always will.

But she has no idea how long her new husband Daniel will recall their happy day. Dad-of-two Daniel, 31, has early onset dementia.  The couple planned their wedding in just three months to ensure he could remember as much as possible, for as long as possible. They also had a videographer film the ceremony and reception last Saturday, while their family and friends took hundreds of photographs to help Daniel cling to his memories as his mind fades.  Jordan, 30, says: “I was worried Dan would be really emotional and forget what he wanted to say in his vows, but he spoke from the heart. He was so clear and calm, he didn’t falter once. “He told me to remember how he feels about me and that he will feel that way forever, even when the disease takes hold and he can’t show me anymore. It was wonderful to hear those words. “It was me who got quite emotional towards the end of my vows.  I tried to hold my breath so I wouldn’t cry, but I ended up sobbing the last few words. I couldn’t help myself. Thankfully Dan understood me.  “The next day we sat down and looked through all the photographs. If his memory starts to fade, we will have all those photographs and the video to show him how perfect our day was and how happy we were.” The couple from Hucknall, Notts, had another reason for bringing forward their wedding.  As the disease progresses Daniel tires more easily, his speech slurs and his co-ordination deteriorates. They wanted to make sure Daniel could enjoy the day, share a magical first dance with Jordan, and speak clearly and confidently with his family and friends. The plan worked. Daniel and Jordan were the last ones on the dance floor and although his medication means he can’t drink much alcohol, he was able to enjoy a glass of \u0026shychampagne and a pint. ● Vascular dementia is the second most common type of dementia (after Alzheimer’s), affecting around 150,000 people in the UK. ● Symptoms can include memory loss and difficulties thinking, problem-solving or with language. ● 5.2% of under-65s in the UK have dementia – that’s over 42,000. ● Some people have both vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease – this is called mixed dementia. ● Dementia affects about 10% of those aged over 65, with 20% of those over 80 years suffering from severe dementia. They even had a special guest in the form of Nottingham actress Vicky McClure, best known for her BAFTA-winning role in This Is England and for cop show Line of Duty. Daniel and the actress became friends while raising awareness for the \u0026shyAlzheimer’s Society.  They’ve also worked together on a new BBC \u0026shydocumentary, My Dementia Choir, as Vicky’s \u0026shygrandmother died from dementia. And they will complete the charity’s annual Memory Walk together next month. Daniel says: “Everything went so fast, it was like a twilight zone, but it was the perfect day.” Daniel was diagnosed with early onset dementia in September last year.   It is caused by a genetic mutation called PSEN1 inherited from his dad Adrian, who died from the condition when he was just 36 years-old. Fewer than 600 people worldwide have been diagnosed with it. At the time doctors suspected Adrian had vCJD, the human version of mad cow’s disease.  They only discovered he had dementia 25 years after his death when they tested a sample of his blood and brain, which had been preserved at a laboratory in Edinburgh, after Daniel started showing the same symptoms.  First Daniel started suffering from depression, then his memory and \u0026shycoordination deteriorated and he started suffering from headaches.  Soon Daniel lost his engineering job because he was “under performing”. The couple discovered he could have inherited an aggressive form of dementia when Jordan was three months pregnant with twins Jasper and Lola, now two. Their worst nightmare was confirmed when they received Daniel’s blood test results last autumn. As the disease is hereditary, there is a 50% chance the twins will develop it too. If the couple had known before Jordan was pregnant they could have used IVF to ensure they used embryos without the faulty gene to avoid passing it on.  Daniel says: “The news was so bad I put my head in my hands and went into shock. Everyone was in tears.” His mum Lorraine fights back tears as she recalls the heartbreaking conversation that followed. “Daniel said to me, “If I ever end up like my dad did, please don’t let my children see me in that way.” “The last time Daniel saw his dad he was in bed and couldn’t speak. That is Daniel’s last memory of his dad. So I told him that no matter what, I will never let that happen.” Daniel can no longer carry his \u0026shychildren to bed, though he still reads them a bedtime story.  And he cannot look after them by himself because he cannot remember whether they have eaten or had anything to drink.   Losing his job and social life has left him isolated, raising his risk of \u0026shydepression, a common symptom of dementia. He is on medication to slow the disease, but it only works for one third of patients. The family have had to move to a new home where Daniel can have a ground floor bedroom and bathroom when he can no longer manage the stairs. Jordan has just returned to her job at an NHS diabetes clinic to support the family after taking time off to care for Daniel and the twins. Jordan says: “All the support for dementia is designed for older people whose children are grown up and can help care for them. They don’t have young twins. We’ve had to fight for everything.  Whenever we tell people Dan has Alzheimer’s they are confused because he is so young. It’s frustrating but we can’t be angry because a couple of years ago we didn’t know it was possible.” Determined to make their remaining time together happy, the family have drawn up a bucket list for Daniel. The talented drummer has performed live in a pub, playing Sweet Child Of Mine by Guns N’ Roses, and they have booked a holiday to Disneyland in Florida in November. Daniel has also set himself a goal of walking the twins to their first day of school. After 12 years together, Jordan proposed to him shortly after he was diagnosed – but he refused. Daniel says: “I wanted to be the one to ask her, I wanted it to be special. She deserves that.”  Given a free family cruise in Scandinavia by a relative, Daniel took Jordan for a walk on deck one evening as the sun set. Jordan says: “Then Dan’s mum came up to him. I thought she was straightening his jacket, but she was actually telling him to get the ring out. He forgot which pocket he put it in. The next moment Dan proposed and a bottle of champagne appeared. It was perfect.” With just three months to plan the wedding, they delegated much of the responsibility to friends and family.

The Bradley Foundation was set up to continue the legacy of the Sunderland superfan who lost his fight against neuroblastoma last year at the age of six.  In a passionate Facebook post on Thursday afternoon, the charity defended itself against social media claims relating to the misuse of funds raised in Bradley’s name, reports Chronicle Live .  One highlighted comment suggested the Lowery family were enjoying a “luxury lifestyle” and suggested “the truth will be out soon”.  Bradley\u0027s mum Gemma hit back at the accusations and said all the money raised in her son\u0027s name was given to the foundation. She said: “We have had a few people writing silly comments saying the charity money is not going to the charity. “Anybody in their right mind knows every penny donated to charity stays with the charity. Everything that was raised for Bradley, we donated it all. “I don’t think they realise everything that goes on behind the scenes. People don’t know we’re sometimes up till midnight messaging parents about treatment options. “It’s a shame we have to justify ourselves when we are working 16-17 hour days.”  The Foundation’s lengthy response also revealed the charity is in the process of its annual audit and the results will be published online. Gemma, from Blackhall Colliery, added: “We are getting punished because we have not published everything we do with the money. “They will be free for every single person to look at.” Lynn Murphy, head of communications and fundraising with the Foundation, confirmed the charity will not have a definitive figure on the money raised until the annual audit is completed.  The accounts will show funds was spent on four rounds of last-ditch rounds of immunotherapy treatment for Bradley in the last months of his life. Lynn said the Foundation received numerous trolling messages, but the accusation of a “luxury lifestyle” prompted the charity to respond. She added: “Cremating a child is not a life of luxury, it’s a life of torment and grief. Gemma’s emotional state at this time is not great - she should not have to put up with these messages. “We have had messages from every single one of the families we have worked with saying how sorry we are we have to go through this. “We thank everyone in the local community for their support. These comments are few and far between.

But public loos are being wiped out at a staggering rate as councils struggle with government budget cuts. More than a QUARTER of public toilets have disappeared since the turn of the century, according to data obtained under Freedom of Information laws. According to the new information - supplied by council areas across the UK - the total number of public toilets across the country has dropped from 3,084 in 2000 to 2,290 in 2018. That is a fall of nearly 800. And authorities in Bolsover, North East Derbyshire, and Wokingham admitted they no longer had ANY council-run loos. In London, of the councils that provided information, the number of public loos was down from 197 in 2000 to just 132 today. The rest of England saw a fall from 2,400 to 1,534, while in Wales numbers had more than halved from 504 to 243. Scotland was down from 759 to 421 while Northern Ireland dropped from 95 to 84.  Campaigners say the problem leaves people with nowhere to go when they need to go and it is affecting everyone from outdoor workers such as builders as well as pregnant women and parents with children. Toilets that can be easily found and used are essential for the elderly and disabled. And with one in five people above 40 suffering from an over-active bladder, the lack of public facilities can make some reluctant to leave their homes due to the risk of being caught short. It is not a legal requirement to provide public lavatories and so when councils aren\u0027t feeling flush, toilet blocks are often targeted first when it comes to cuts. A typical toilet block is estimated to cost between \u0026pound12,000 to \u0026pound15,000 a year to maintain. But Domestos believes that clean, safe toilets should be within everyone’s reach. That is why it is launching the nationwide Use Our Loos initiative to tackle the demise and unlock loos in local coffee shops, cafes, restaurants and bars across Britain’s towns, cities and villages.  The scheme is urging local shops and businesses to sign up, throw open their cubicles and make their toilets available to non-customers. As part of the initiative, Domestos is also partnering with The Great British Public Toilet Map – an interactive street map that shows users where their nearest public toilet is and which businesses have signed up to the scheme. The map will be regularly updated as new businesses join. Domestos also plays a role in the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan’s aim to get 25 million people across the world access to a clean and safe toilet by 2020. Domestos has partnered with Unicef, the world’s leading children’s organisa\u0026shytion, since 2012 and has already helped 10 million people around the world get cleaner, safer toilets.  Raymond Martin of the British Toilet Association which campaigns for better public facilities, has praised the initiative, saying it will increase visitors to Britain’s high streets. He says : “As human beings we all have to eat, drink, sleep, breathe and go to the toilet,” he said. “Having access to a clean hygienic toilet is absolutely vital for our everyday life and activity. Rebecca Light, Domestos Senior Brand Manager, says: “In the UK the problem is locating a public toilet. An estimated 2.3 billion people worldwide lack access to clean, safe sanitation. This comes with significant health risks, including diarrhoea, which kills one child every two minutes. It’s vital we change this – and quickly.” "},{"url":null,"title":"house fraser owed nearly 1bn","story":"NewsHouse of Fraser owed nearly £1bn to creditors when it went bust before Mike Ashley swooped in to take overBusiness tycoon Mike Ashley, who paid £90m for the department store chain, is not thought to be liable for outstanding debtsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByGraham HiscottHead of Business19:52, 17 AUG 2018Updated20:17, 17 AUG 2018NewsHouse of Fraser had racked up debts of almost £1bn (Image: Publicity Picture)Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email House of Fraser owed nearly \u0026pound1 billion when it went bust, documents reveal.

David Jones was found guilty of one count of stalking and a separate charge of assault on Stacey Buckley following a confrontation at her home. Jones, 37, from Rochdale, suspected Ms Buckley may have found new love after they broke up and hid the device in the boot of her vehicle to track her movements. But when he monitored Ms Buckley who had been on an apparent shopping trip to Bury, Greater Manchester, he discovered she had made a detour to a house and decided to follow. He later found her holding hands and laughing with her sister\u0027s ex-girlfriend Laura Flynn, in a cafe at the Trafford Centre shopping mall, a court heard during the trial.  Ms Buckley found out about the device when Jones sent a bragging picture of the tracker after he kept inexplicably showing up in the same place as her. He wrote: I’ll find you wherever you are!. In a victim statement read to court, Ms Buckley said: “I am half the person I used to be. I no longer want to go out anymore. “My relationship has suffered with my children. I want to get on with my life but this is proving difficult. “It was in front of the children. I am upset it happened and the children had to see this.  “I do think he will come back and do not know what he would do. I do not know if he would talk to me or go for me again. “He left me feeling very scared and vulnerable. I am worried he will come to the house again and attack me.” The trial heard how Ms Buckley was attacked by Jones during a confrontation at her home in December 2017. She said: \u0027\u0027He pushed me back into the door, and then closed it behind him and began shouting at me saying he knew where I had been that day. \u0027\u0027He saw red.

If they hear anybody say anything they just lock the doors. They need to speak up! “They are cult-like —– like Scientology — because they are secretive.

Timothy Philpott stabbed her several times in the chest and her life was only saved by concerned neighbours who heard her screams and knocked on the door of the home in Cannock, Staffordshire. The victim told police how she had argued with Philpott, 29, in the early hours of February 19 after he accused her of having an affair. The Express and Star report that Philpott was paranoid his partner was seeing someone who lived across the road. At first the thug had punched and kicked his partner and when she told him he would not be able to see his children he replied: I may as well kill you. I\u0027ll stab you, and fetched a carving knife from the kitchen.   A neighbour told Stafford Crown Court they’d heard the victim shout shortly before 2am: “Help me, help me, he’s trying to kill me.”  With his savage attack stopped by the neighbours Philpott left the knife embedded in the victim\u0027s chest and fled the scene with police called. Officers entering the property found the victim, aged 26 at the time of the incident, on a sofa with a knife blade protruding from her chest. There was blood on the walls and all over her hair and body. They were shining a torch into a coal shed at the rear of a property nearby when they heard a sound in the garden.  They saw a man matching Philpott\u0027s description and shouted for him to get on the floor warning him they had a Taser. They handcuffed and arrested him. In a police interview Philpott told detectives he had argued with his partner and had only realised the extent of the assault when there was banging at the door and he ‘snapped out of his red mist.’ Philpott was sentenced to 12 years in jail with a further four years on licence. He pleaded guilty on May 22. The victim underwent emergency surgery at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, having the knife removed from her chest by surgeons. She is still receiving treatment for a hand injury as she severed tendons when she tried to take hold of the knife, Staffordshire Police said in a statement.

Katy Jackson, 44, from Peterborough began to use topical steroid creams 25 years ago to combat psoriasis that would leave her face raw and swollen. But little did she know that her skin would become addicted to the treatment, resulting in short bouts of clear skin followed by psoriasis flare ups that would be twice as bad as before. In 2014 she started using the ointment every day for three months after becoming stressed by her dad needed a triple heart bypass. But this only made her skin worse, resulting in her refusing to leave the house because she was so upset by her appearance.  After realising that the her skin had become addicted to her constant use, she decided to stop using the cream all together. Since then she has been battling agonising cycles of her skin burning, swelling and oozing, then scabbing and peeling off. She described the last three and a half years as a ‘living hell’ but thankfully her skin is now starting to clear-up and she believes she will not have another flare-up. Katy, a beauty therapist, said: “When I realised there wasn’t anything I could do but go cold turkey, I didn’t imagine for one second that three and a half years later I still wouldn’t be cured. “The first four months was hell on earth, my life was a misery and I didn’t leave the house – I was so tired that I slept all the time. “I would wake up so swollen, I looked like I had been beaten-up, I couldn’t eat at times as the skin was falling off my lips and anything touched it would burn. “When it was red, raw and oozing, I looked like an acid attack victim, once client recoiled when she saw me opening the door to her, and said ‘Sorry, I thought you were in a fire.’ “Then it was tight and plastic feeling where I couldn’t move my face. It was bright but not as red, but looked shiny and swelled up my eyes and lips.  “Now I can finally say I’m healing. It’s taken a long time, but my neck has been clear for a year now, so I can safely say that’s done, my face looks nothing like it did before. “I’ve gone a long time with clearer skin, I can’t see it coming back, but you never know. “I am so anti-steroids now, I wouldn’t advise anyone using them for a long period of time.” Katy started using steroid creams at the age of 19, to treat patches of psoriasis that developed on her face. She said: “I have used steroid cream on and off over the years, I was never a heavy user but would use it when parties or events would come up.  “I knew that when I used it the psoriasis would go away be it would be short-lived and would come back twice as bad.” Katy increased her steroid cream usage to every other day during a stressful period, when her father was undergoing a triple heart bypass. While the medication cleared her skin, after reducing her usage her face began to burn and swelled drastically. Katy said: “After three months using it, I noticed my face was full of psoriasis with small gaps of normal skin and it had never been to that extent ever. “I wondered if it was a something like a different make-up remover, but I couldn’t pinpoint anything different, then suddenly I wondered if it was the steroid creams. “ Katy was referred to a dermatologist who prescribed a five-day course of another steroid cream and an oral steroid. A couple of days after her final dosage her symptoms came back worse than ever, leading her to research online and find the International Topical Steroid Addiction Network (ITSAN). She quit steroid treatment and embarked on the now three-and-a-half-hear journey. Kat said: “It was hell on earth to live with and it felt like I was constantly crying until the eight-month mark, when my skin seemed to get a little better.

Brian Lord OBE says a successful attack on its infrastructure could cause “unprecedented damage” and “unrest across the world”. With a complex ecosystem of computation, networking, and physical operational processes spread around the world the industry has a large attack surface with many attack vectors. A typical large oil and gas company uses half a million processors just for oil and gas reservoir simulation and stores petabytes of sensitive and competitive field data as well as sharing and drilling and production control systems across geographies, fields, vendors, service providers, and partners.  The topic will be high on the agenda for industry leaders at this year’s ADIPEC conference in Abu Dhabi. Lord says: “The oil and gas industry is the second most susceptible to cyber-attacks, with the potential to cause unprecedented damage and unrest across the world. “The primary cyber threat to oil and gas infrastructure comes from hostile states who are developing disruptive capabilities in order to deliver power projection for their own long term geo-political and politico-military ends. “Such is the severity of a threat from a relatively small disruptive attack at the right part of an unprepared oil \u0026amp gas system, the issue will be a key topic at this year’s ADIPEC conference, the premier global energy forum for oil \u0026amp gas experts, where industry leaders will be sharing best practice and new developments in order to ensure they always remain one step ahead.” "},{"url":null,"title":"passport forged edith cavell helped","story":"NewsPassport forged by hero nurse Edith Cavell helped soldier escape German imprisonment in First World WarThe fake document has emerged 103 years after the death of the war heroine and helped Louis Mossini to escape to the NetherlandsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAdam Aspinall18:28, 17 AUG 2018Updated18:38, 17 AUG 2018NewsBritish nurse and patriot Edith Cavell (Image: Mirrorpix)Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA passport forged by war heroine Edith Cavell to help a soldier escape German-occupied Belgium has emerged 103 years after her death.

As this year has rolled on, I’ve been hoping for a similarly uplifting image because there’s been far too many depressing stories about race, \u0026shyreligion and nationality.   The Windrush scandal exposed how our politicians had been attempting to deny citizenship to Caribbean immigrants invited here in the 1950s to re-build post-war Britain.

Convicted racist Tommy Robinson is now a feted martyr, with Steve Bannon, the architect of Trump’s brutal anti-immigration policies which saw children ripped from their mothers at the Mexican border, hailing him a hero. Indeed a rally in support of the jailed Nazi poster boy saw the largest fascist gathering in Britain since the days of Oswald Mosley.  A far-right group called the Football Lads Alliance has marched in cities attempting to seduce working-class fans to join their white \u0026shysupremacist crusade.

Zoe Bloodworth, 32, turned detective after raiders wrecked her home and stole her late grandmother\u0027s treasured jewelery. The following day she stopped neighbour Ross Peters, 41, in the street to ask him if he\u0027d seen anyone acting suspiciously in the area. While they chatted Zoe realised his zip-up was an identical match to the one worn by the \u0027lookout man\u0027 filmed during the crime. Police were called in and Peters has now been jailed. Assistant primary school headteacher Zoe said: It actually clicked as he was walking towards me - I didn\u0027t let him know I knew because he is a dangerous man.

When we were talking he acted completely like he hadn\u0027t heard anything and said \u0027let me take your number if I hear anything I will call you\u0027. He looked me in the eyes, shook his head and told me he knew nothing. There was no remorse.

Zoe returned to her trashed home and discovered \u0026pound7,000 worth of sentimental items had been taken. This included jewellery left to her by her late grandmother, who died last year. CCTV outside her home in Kempston, Beds., showed Peters lurking outside for 45 minutes as \u0027lookout\u0027 while another unknown man went inside and carried out the raid. Zoe added: Ross was someone I would have waved to as I drove past or I would have said ‘Hi’ if he had walked past me in the street.

The 55-year-old dad was on duty overnight at the supermarket in Gorton, Manchester last Friday when he was the victim of the horrific unprovoked attack.  The dad-of-three from Gorton told the Manchester Evening News : I saw on the camera that he had not paid for a bag.  “I just told him ‘you have not paid for the bag’. “He went out and then came back.

Chantelle Grace had been in labour for 12 hours when her younger sister, Natasha Palmer, was rushed in to the hospital maternity room next door, having also gone into labour with her first child.  Miss Palmer gave birth to her daughter Phoebe at 2:15am, just 45 minutes after arriving at hospital .  Mrs Grace then gave birth three hours later, with her son Lennox arriving at 5.20am.

Her younger sister, a 27-year-old nurse from Ryde, on the island, was due a day later on July 30.

In the latest instalment on the TLC channel, Dr Sandra Lee, 47, treats a patient known as Taylor who comes to the clinic looking to get rid of a tail-like growth she has in between her buttocks. She has even nicknamed the growth \u0027Lizzie the Lipoma\u0027. The patient explains she has had the lump on her bottom since she was born but it grew bigger in her teenage years. A doctor removed it in 2016 claiming it was a benign fatty tumour called a lipoma but it grew back.  Lipomas are harmless lumps that can grow anywhere on the body. They don\u0027t normally need to be removed unless they cause a problem or a doctor suspects the lump could be something more sinister. But in Taylor\u0027s case, the lump was seriously impacting on her self-image.  Desperate to have it removed and her self-confidence restored Taylor comes to Dr Lee for help. But the worried doctor refuses to operate after her first consultation. She said: There\u0027s two warning bells. One is, why did this doctor remove this and then it came right back? And then the other big thing for me is, a regular lipoma does not appear at birth. You get that over time. There could be something else going on. Doctor Lee orders MRI scan which shows there is a deposit of fat inside Taylor\u0027s spinal cord. When Dr Lee offers to remove some of the tissue on the bump to make it more aesthetically pleasing, she warns that the procedure could disrupt Taylor\u0027s spinal cord.

Leston Lawrence, 35, who had been an employee at the bank for seven years, was sentenced to 30 months in prison last year .  He sold 17 of the golden \u0027pucks\u0027 through Ottawa Gold Buyers.  According to the Ottawa Citizen , the reasoning behind the steep reduction in his fine was on the basis that the gold that he stole was not as valuable then as it was when he was ordered to pay it back.  The court said that he had stuck the golden nuggets up his rectum and \u0027walked straight out of the door\u0027.  He was only caught when he set off metal detectors after his shift and by staff noticing strange behaviour. He asked to cash two checks worth $15,200 from the local gold buyers. When they asked where he had got this money from, he very simply stated that he had sold gold nuggets. Despite setting off metal detectors, no pieces of gold were actually found up his bottom by hand-held detectors. Police seized a gold puck that Lawrence had sold and found four more in his safety deposit box.  They put two and two together when they discovered a pot of Vaseline and latex gloves in his locker. At the time of his sentencing, he was jailed for 30 months and fined $145,900 to pay the bank back for their shortages, but this has now been slashed by nearly $60,000. The weight of the 17 laundered pucks ranged from 192 to 264 grams per piece and sold between $6,800 and $9,500 each in 2014 and 2015. He had three years from the end of his full sentence to pay it back, and if he failed he would be re-incarcerated for another 30 months. When he stole the precious metal it was worth around $165,000, allowing him to sell it for around $130,000.

I’m pleased we stuck to our guns and we got what we deserved.”There was plenty to be happy about including an impressive display from winger Cammy Dow.Jimmy said: “Sam Jackson did great, he’s a confident big boy and I thought Cammy Dow was excellent – he’s a massive Dundee fan as well, which is great.”The second-round draw is today at 1pm.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba proud of his dundee united players for handling pressure at queen of the south","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United’s players might have been feeling the pressure according to boss Csaba Laszlo but he was proud they didn’t show it in their their 2-1 victory at Queen of the South.An impressive first-half display put the Tangerines in a winning position as Sam Stanton and debutant Pavol Safranko gave them a two-goal lead.The second period saw United have to defend their lead as the Doonhamers came at them with Stephen Dobbie knocking in after 67 minutes – Csaba’s men, though, held them at arms length for the rest of the contest and grabbed their first victory of the league season.The manager said: “I am proud of the boys because they did a good job.“We were under pressure because we knew against Dunfermline we lost an important game and now the second game of the season we had to perform and to win.“This was definitely a very good team performance and I am proud of the boys, they worked for each other.“We had a really bad start at home against Dunfermline and I think the players felt there was pressure.“We don’t want to disappoint our fans again and you saw there were a lot of our fans at the game and they celebrated also.“The fans made the noise against Dunfermline that it wasn’t good enough and we heard that.“I said after that Dundee United can play better football and our fans deserved more spirit, more fighting spirit and better results.“That pressure is always there if you have the jersey of Dundee United, if you are the manager of Dundee United, work for Dundee United you are the biggest club in the Championship and everybody wants to beat you.“People think it is easy to win a game, it is not easy – you have to respect the opponent, you have to know in this league it is not always nice football, it is more fighting and desire.“You could see Queen of the South didn’t give up, in the second half they put I don’t know how many balls up front.“I am really pleased with the first-half performance, I am a little bit angry we don’t close the game out but I’m happy with the three points and the performance from the team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/SNS-15302518-DUFC-V-ST-J.jpg-503x564.jpg ","title":"dundee colts and united drawn at home in irn bru cup","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee Colts and Dundee United have been awarded home ties in the Irn Bru Cup.The second round draw has seen the Dark Blues youngsters host Motherwell Colts.Meanwhile United will welcome Alloa Athletic to Tannadice.

I just didn’t get my game-time.“When I did play at Dundee, I think I did well, but I thank Neil McCann for giving me the chance to come out to Dunfermline on loan.“The system we played at Dundee didn’t help me. We were playing just one up front and I was playing as a second striker and on the left and the right wing.“I was happy to play, I was happy to get a game but I don’t think it was my right position.“All my goals I scored with Dundee came when I was in my right position, in the middle, and I’m happy to get the chance to play there with Dunfermline.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b729b44b349c-463x564.jpg ","title":"new boy safranko hopes debut goal is only the start at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIT’s been a “non-stop” start to life at Dundee United for Pavol Safranko and he’s hoping an impressive debut is just the beginning of a successful spell at Tannadice.The Slovakian international was officially signed on Friday, despite having trained with the Tangerines through the week, and was quickly thrust into the starting XI at Queen of the South.Despite not having much time to settle, the 23-year-old quickly opened his scoring account for United as he looped the ball over Queens keeper Alan Martin for a goal that eventually gave his new side three points.He said: “I arrived five days before the game. It has been non-stop.“It was only five days and my first game so I need to know how my team-mates play.“I had four training sessions so it was a little bit crazy but it was good to help the team to win by scoring.“I’m happy with the start but the three points were the most important thing.“We have to start to win games but when I score it is always nice.“It was a good pass from Frederic Frans and I saw the goalkeeper went down so I just wanted to put it behind him and I think it was a good strike.“I think the first half was a good performance and we need to build on that.“The second half wasn’t perfect so we need to change something there.”Safranko joined the club on a year-long loan deal from Danish side Aalborg last week.He was well-known to manager Csaba Laszlo, though, as they worked together at Dunajska Streda (DAC) in Slovakia.There, Safranko knocked in six goals in 12 games after signing for the second half of the season as DAC went on an extended unbeaten run.And the chance to work with Csaba once more was a big draw for the striker once he heard Aalborg were happy to let him leave.He said: “I played under Csaba Laszlo in Slovakia at Dunajska Streda.“There we were unbeaten for 16 games in a row so I know what I can expect from him and I’m looking forward to playing for him again.“Csaba was the big part of why I joined Dundee United because I had a really good relationship with Csaba. I want to work for him.“I can honestly say that in Denmark there is a bit more combination football but here it is a little bit more fighting which will, hopefully, suit me better.“I can say every player dreams to play football in the United Kingdom so this was also one of the reasons I came here.”Safranko certainly knows the Scottish Championship is about “fighting” as he was given a welcome by the Queens backline.The makings of a black eye was clear in the Slovak’s face during and after the game as he battled with the Palmerston defenders.“I heard the Scottish league is quite hard – now I can feel it!” he added.“It is my style and how I play. We will see, I don’t want to speak too much because it was just my first game.”The Tangerines now have the best part of two weeks before their next Championship fixture – time Safranko thinks they can use to their advantage.“We will have time to train and I’m sure with this squad we can be much better in our next game.“The first half was our good phase because I had Nicky Clark close to me. He is a good player, and we can build on it.“Everyone fought and we have to continue with that because if just one person loses a battle, we will have problems.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7540a9bb2e3-846x564.jpg ","title":"organisers of scottish independence march give assurances as thousands more set to walk dundee streets than expected","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOrganisers of a Scottish independence march have given assurances that Saturday’s event will go off without a hitch \u0026#8211 despite potentially thousands more people turning up than originally expected.The March for Independence, organised by All Under One Banner, will see protesters take to the streets in support of breaking away from the UK.A list of notifications on Dundee City Council’s website states 1,000 marchers are expected to descend on the city.But organisers now expect anywhere between 10,000 and 20,000 people to show up.

I once asked him how it came about and he said ‘well, I kind of led my men into a minefield and I had to get them out of there and the best way was to go forward’.“We were incredibly proud of them and he was incredibly proud to be a Gordon Highlander.“So much so that years later he helped form the Old Comrades’ Association.“It’s great.

A long ball was flicked on and McDONALD was in behind the defence and, with Leask slightly off his line, the striker produced a brilliant lob to score from the edge of the box.The lead didn’t last though, two minutes later the Broch got a free-kick on the left, Graham Johnston drove the ball in, Euan Storrier parried but straight off Michael CLARK who diverted it into his own net.Huntly led again on 65 minutes when Napier slipped the ball through for McDONALD, who had evaded the offside trap, 12 yards out, Leask got a touch to his shot but couldn’t keep it out.Fraserburgh responded with Paul Campbell heading sub Sean Butcher’s cross from the right against the left post on 75 minutes.With eight minutes to go Huntly had Gary McGowan sent off for a gesture towards the crowd.And on 86 minutes Barbour flicked Greg Buchan’s cross on to the right post – but despite Fraserburgh’s best efforts they couldn’t equalise.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"gallery broad street and provost skenes house through the decades","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThis week we’ve searched our archives for some of our favourite images of how Broad Street and Provost Skene\u0026#8217s House have changed over the past few decades."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/07/18, 3:43 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.It was a case of \u0026#8216all\u0026#8217s well that ends well\u0026#8217 for young Adam in the Furnace hills last week.Police officers and his mum left him in no doubt of how narrow an escape he had.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities. In front of the parade was musician Pat Kenny playing haunting tones on a carnyx, an Iron Age Celtic war horn.On the green there were stands selling everything from soap to artwork and woolly bunnets to garden shrubs.As well as battle re-enactments and weapons demonstrations there were living history demonstrations and workshops where adults and children tried their hand at traditional crafts such as spinning, weaving, metalworking, woodwork, dressing up and blowing the carnyx.Children took part in the Lughnasa Games, featuring various tests of Celtic warrior skills.Brian MacLennan of Lochgilphead Community Council said: \u0026#8216The day was a massive success and I\u0026#8217ve had lots of positive feedback. Having a full programme of events in the arena as well as lots workshops for adults and youngsters to take part in throughout the day, has really made a big difference this year.\u0026#8217He added: \u0026#8216I would like to give a special mention to the 19th Argyll Scouts, the MS Centre and Lochgilphead Parish Church, without whom I\u0026#8217d have had no marquees, tables or chairs, and to Bluestone Gift Shop, the Grubs Up Recovery Cafe and the new Scottish Canals Steamer Terminal in Ardrishaig who all stepped in on the day before the festival with the additional funding and sponsorship that I needed to ensure the full scale festival could go ahead as planned.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217d also like to thank all the performers, providers and other contributors for making such a great day and would especially like to thank the volunteers who helped set up the site on Friday night and took everything down and away on Saturday evening.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m already thinking of ways to make the festival even bigger and better next year.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"imagination and colour at lochgilphead lego show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/08/18, 6:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA vast array of imaginative models were on display at the two-day Lochgilphead Lego Show.Lochgilphead Community Centre was the venue for the weekend of plastic brick magic on Saturday August 4 and Sunday August 5.Interactive workshops with Glasgow-based Bricks4Kids gave an insight into basic engineering using Lego, while the imagination room did exactly what the name suggests.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

The pitch at the school is too small to host even an under-13 game.‘For Mid Argyll Rugby Club to grow, it needs to have a home to create an identity. In recent years, plans and promises to create a rugby facility have always come to nothing and the game in Mid Argyll has suffered for it.\u0026#8216We have a Scottish School cup game on Tuesday August 28 and at the moment we are still looking for a venue. How can we compete with central belt schools, or even our neighbours in Oban, who have facilities provided by the council?’The club has steadily been developing fresh talent for more than five years, but with nowhere to play it cannot field a first 15 despite plenty of willing players.The pitch project, supported by Scottish Rugby and Argyll and Bute Rugby Development Officer Allan Wright, hopes to be open by autumn 2019.Another supporter of the project is Councillor Dougie Philand, who said: ‘I have been involved with senior rugby previously and having our own pitch was always a problem.\u0026#8216I would fully support any development or plans that would promote a permanent pitch and changing areas especially now when there is a resurgence in junior rugby. I would also be happy to be involved in any negotiations to obtain the land from the council.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"russell voices opposition to inveraray rbs closure plans","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 17/08/18, 5:48 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowArgyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell has written to the external consultants considering the future of key Royal Bank of Scotland branches to express his continued opposition to closure of the Inveraray Branch.Along with nine other rural branches, Inveraray was given a stay of execution earlier this year – but if the figures do not stack up by December 2018 the busy tourist town will be left with no bank to serve residents, businesses or visitors.Mr Russell said: \u0026#8216I have been against the slew of closures in Argyll and Bute and still am, but all those threatened have now gone with the exception of Inveraray.\u0026#8216Inveraray is a tourist magnet with a need for services for those who don’t live in the area, while tourism and other businesses require banking services.\u0026#8216Argyll and Bute Council along with other agencies are working hard to reverse the depopulation of rural parts of Argyll and Bute and the removal of such a vital service can only work to undermine this.\u0026#8217Mr Russell added: \u0026#8216It should be acknowledged that as RBS is state owned, it should have a duty of care to those who rescued it from bankruptcy.

The big bird was scoffing the chips close to the Gaiety Theatre in Ayr. A grainy image of the pointless attack has only now emerged. The man is wearing what looks like a white short sleeved shirt, black trousers and white training shoes. He is seen lifting his right leg back and then battering the chip-loving gull. Any kick to a creature like this would have left it in a very painful condition or at worst cause it to die from internal injuries. The chips had already been dropped on the ground close to the junction of Carrick Street and Boswell Park and it is not been regarded as a case where the gull actually stole the grub. Ironically the bird’s attacker was also eating his own portion of takeway food. The grainy image looks to have been taken from mobile phone footage. It appears to be right outside a late night food takeaway. The bird-brained incident took place on Saturday July 28 and only yesterday (Tuesday) was it able to be made public. An undercover inspector from the charity’s special investigations unit has been working on the case. He said: “We are being assisted by Police Scotland in our investigation and we would like to trace the individual involved. “I would urge anyone who recognises him to get in touch. “ Any information given to our animal helpline is treated confidentially and can be given nonymously. “Recently we have been made aware of a number of incidents involving attacks on seagulls and would like to remind the public that gulls, like all other birds, are protected by law. “We’d encourage the public to clear up any rubbish as gulls are attracted to it as they look for food.” Anyone who thinks they know the lout or remember him from that Saturday should call the Scottish SPCA animal helpline on 03000 999 999. Ayr is in the middle of a seagull crisis at the moment with some of them attacking people including a prominent lawyer who had to fight off the attack using a rolled up copy of the Ayrshire Post. He was pecked on the top of his head in Burns Statue Square and the attack drew blood.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsPolice Scotland"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13080662.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_090818LABOUR_07JPG.jpg","title":"scottish labour leader richard leonard","story":"NewsScottish Labour leader Richard Leonard stops off in Doon ValleyHe made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet13:53, 14 AUG 2018NewsLabour leader Richard Leonard visited Dalmellington (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRichard Leonard went on a charm offensive in an area that was once a Labour heartland. And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre.  Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

Four examples of these keeps survive in a ruinous state around Innerleithen and Traquair.\nThe walls themselves cannot speak so I have turned to Innerleithen \u0026amp Traquair, Past and Present, with an Angler\u0026rsquos Guide to the Tweed and its Tributaries (Second Edition \u0026ndash 1867), commonly called Smail\u0026rsquos Guide as it was published by Innerleithen printer Robert Smail.\nElibank Castle: \u0026ldquoAbout a mile east of Bold is Juniper Bank, near which \u0026ndash a considerable way up the hill \u0026ndash is the ruin of Elibank Tower, the ancient seat of the Murrays of Elibank, and famous for the story of Muckle-mouthed Meg, in which young Scott of Harden figured so conspicuously. (Smail\u0026rsquos Guide, pp. 96)\nCardrona Tower: \u0026ldquo...Cardrona was for many ages...the property of a family of the name of Govan, chiefs of the name, one of whom, Laurence of Govan, was Sheriff of Traquair in 1358. They resided in the old Tower on the hill, which is now in ruins. The Govans continued in possession of Cardrona until the latter end of the seventeenth century, when it was purchased by Mr Williamson, writer in Peebles, and Town Clerk of that burgh. (Smail\u0026rsquos Guide, pp. 104-105)\nHorsburgh Castle: \u0026ldquoAccordingly, as it was then uninhabited [1775], and, from its condition, not likely to become again a family residence, he [an unnamed neighbour who wished to buy the castle] requested permission to improve it according to his taste. This was granted, and the work of demolition was soon begun. The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey. (Smails\u0026rsquo Guide, pp. 15 \u0026ndash 16)\nNether Horsburgh Castle: \u0026ldquo...we find that the lands of Easter Horseburgh, then called Schelynelaw, together with lands of Traquair and Innerleithen were, in 1634, in the hands of John Stewart of Traquair, who in that year was served heir to his brother Robert. The tradition in the family [Horseburgh] is that this part of the property was sold to defray the expenses of a lawsuit which had arisen between two brothers.\nAt Nether Horsburgh there are the remains of an old tower or keep, which used to be called Shillinglaw Tower. Tradition is silent respecting it, but it was probably built about the time the lands came into the possession of the Stewarts [sometime after 1550].

restructuring in the UK, said: \u0026ldquoHigh street estate agents are presently facing an unprecedented set of challenges.\n\u0026ldquoThe rise of online-only\u0026nbspagencies have combined with falling house prices, a general slowdown in sale activity and a raft of legislative changes, all of which have generated headwinds for your average high street agent.\n\u0026ldquoI would therefore not be surprised to see operators across this sector struggle over the second half of the year and beyond.\nHouse of Fraser      \nMaplin      \nToys R Us      \nNew Look      \nCarpetright      \nMothercare      \nJamie\u0026rsquos Italian Byron      \nProfits at the likes of Foxtons have come under intense pressure recently, with the London property market slowing considerably since the

funding.\nIt comes as the rise of online firms such as Purplebricks, Emoov and Tepilo has eaten into the market share of bricks and mortar firms.\nThe high street has been pummelled this year by several high profile retail administrations and store closure programmes.\nHouse of Fraser, Maplin and Toys R Us have all gone bust, while New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare have all shut stores.\nThe casual dining space has also come under pressure, with Jamie\u0026rsquos Italian and Byron among the firms to close restaurants.\n\u0026ldquoWe continue to see companies in the casual dining and retail spaces battle hard in the face of changing consumer attitudes towards spending, coupled with increased costs as a result of the living wage and business rates pressures, Mr Nimmo said.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst a number of chains have survived through the implementation of successful CVAs or via pre-pack administrations, inevitably there have been site closures and job losses across many parts of the country.\nBut a study by KPMG of notices in the London Gazette shows the total number of companies in England and Wales entering into administration during the second quarter of 2018 fell sharply.\nA total of 302 companies went into administration between April and June 2018, compared with 347 in the previous quarter, a fall of 13%.\nYear-on-year, the number was up from 297 administrations seen during the same period in 2017.\nMr Nimmo added: \u0026ldquoThe latest figures reflect a relatively positive picture for most businesses.\n\u0026ldquoFor the most part, adopting a long-term cautious approach appears to be paying off for the majority of firms, although sectoral-specific challenges and broader global economic changes will inevitably force some businesses to reconsider their operations and potentially restructure their organisations to improve efficiencies.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new

motorists (43%) say driving is less stressful on the Continent than in their own country, a new survey suggests.\nBetter road conditions, fewer traffic jams and cheaper fuel were among the reasons given for people preferring to drive on the other side of the Channel.\nThe survey of 1,070 UK drivers commissioned by RAC Europe revealed that 69% think major roads are better maintained in mainland Europe, with 54% believing that is the case for minor roads.\nThe majority of people think major roads (63%) are less congested on the Continent, while (56%) feel minor roads suffer from fewer queues.\nSome 16% say drivers across the Channel are friendlier, compared with 10% who believe those in the UK are.\nRAC Europe spokesman Rod Dennis said: \u0026ldquoOur research reveals just how keen many of us are about getting behind the wheel on continental roads which drivers tell us are quieter and better maintained with friendlier and better-behaved drivers.\n\u0026ldquoWith high levels of frustration over the quality of road surfaces, the sheer volume of traffic and poor driving standards, it is little wonder that Brits appear to be enjoying their motoring experience abroad.\nA recent

years to more than 700, figures show.\nThe condition, most commonly seen in adults, occurs when the body cannot produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels and can be linked to obesity.\nCouncil leaders described the increase as \u0026ldquoextremely worrying and called for a boost in local funding to help tackle the public health crisis.\nThe figures, from an audit published by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), reveal 715 people under the age of 25 received care for Type 2 diabetes from specialist paediatric units in England and Wales in 2016/17.\nOf those children and young people, 78.6% were also obese.\nThis is an increase of 41% from 2013/14, when there were 507 cases.\nThe data only includes young people treated in paediatric units and not by their GP, and it is believed the true number of young people affected could be much higher.\nProfessor Russell Viner, president of the RCPCH, said: \u0026ldquoA rise in Type 2 diabetes of this magnitude is alarming and shows that the childhood obesity epidemic is starting to bite.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos also concerning that we might not be seeing the full picture.\nThe

the Government to boost investment and to provide specialist support for the most severely obese children.\nIzzi Seccombe, chairwoman of the LGA\u0026rsquos community wellbeing board, said: \u0026ldquoThese figures are a sad indictment of how we have collectively failed as a society to tackle childhood obesity, one of the biggest health challenges we face.\n\u0026ldquoType 2 diabetes typically develops in adults over the age of 40, so while still rare in children, it is extremely worrying that we are seeing more young people develop the condition.\nShe added: \u0026ldquoWe need urgent action now. Type 2 diabetes can be a lifelong debilitating illness and these figures will only multiply if we delay.\n\u0026ldquoCouncils with their public health responsibilities are on the frontline fighting obesity but for this to work effectively they need to be properly resourced.\n\u0026ldquoCutting their public health funding is short-sighted and undermines any attempt to help our children live healthy and fulfilling lives.\nAlmost half of those treated for Type 2 diabetes in paediatric units in 2016/17 were black or Asian, the figures also show, and the LGA said greater support is needed for ethnic minority groups.\nKathryn Kirchner, clinical advisor at Diabetes UK, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough there are a number of risk factors for Type 2 diabetes which are out of our control, one of the most important risk factors is being overweight or obese, which we are able to influence.\n\u0026ldquoThese figures are a stark reminder that we have a collective responsibility to push for the actions outlined in the most recent chapter of Childhood Obesity Plan, including clearer and more consistent food labelling.\nType 2 diabetes can lead to a range of health problems such as heart disease, strokes and kidney problems.\nEustace de Sousa, from Public Health England, said: \u0026ldquoThe rise in type 2 diabetes in young children highlights why bold measures are needed to tackle childhood obesity \u0026ndash and change won\u0026rsquot happen overnight.\n\u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why we\u0026rsquore working with industry to make food healthier, we\u0026rsquove produced guidance for councils on planning healthier towns and we\u0026rsquore delivering campaigns encouraging people to choose healthier food and lead healthier lives.\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe know the damage obesity causes and are determined to halve childhood obesity by 2030.\n\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove invested billions in public health services and have already removed the equivalent of 45 million kilograms of sugar from soft drinks every year.\n\u0026ldquoOur new childhood obesity plan will now get children exercising more in schools and reduce their exposure to sugary and fatty foods.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By Sally Wardle, Press Association Health and Science Correspondent\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u00274aa3dc93-a3ba-4b1d-b688-8dbd37b31761\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:uk\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Figures show \\u2018alarming\\u2019 rise in children with Type 2 diabetes\u0027})\n"},{"url":null,"title":"delays-help-spark-dip-in-airline-passenger-satisfaction","story":"Airline passenger satisfaction has declined over the past two years amid disappointment with in-flight experiences, new figures show.\nThe percentage of people satisfied with their last flight dropped from 90% in spring 2016 to 83% in spring 2018, according to Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) research.\nThe latest survey found that many passengers are unhappy with how common problems are handled, including delays waiting for luggage (58%), long queues at immigration (56%) and flight delays (37%).\nJust 77% of passengers were satisfied with the on-board experience during their last flight, down from 81% in spring 2016.\nThis is the most important factor in determining satisfaction with the overall process from arriving at an airport to collecting baggage on arrival.\nPassengers flying from the North East (90%) and the North West (89%) were the most happy, while those from the East Midlands (77%) and Wales (78%) gave the lowest ratings.\nCAA director Tim Johnson said: \u0026ldquoAlthough satisfaction remains high at 83%, our last two surveys have shown a reduction from 90%.\n\u0026ldquoDelays and disruption can be caused by a range of different factors.

volunteers are leading the tours, which begin at 10.30am and do not need to be booked, with those wishing to take part meeting at the cinema\u0026#8217s front desk.A Courier reporter joined 14 people of all ages \u0026#8211 and a dog \u0026#8211 on Tuesday\u0026#8217s tour, led by Geraldine Davey, and learned a few new things.The tour began by heading back outside to look at the exterior of the building, which was designed by Glasgow School of Art alumni and architect Albert Victor Gardner, at its original entrance.The tour continued into the cinema\u0026#8217s screen one, with its iconic two \u0026#8216wee hooses\u0026#8217 either side of the stage, one of which used to be a broom cupboard and the other allegedly the manager\u0026#8217s office.It was revealed that in 1960 it cost 3s to sit on the balcony and 1s 6d to sit in the stalls.People said that it was actually quite expensive at the time, with one commenting: \u0026#8216It cost a lot of pocket money to come to the cinema.\u0026#8217A few people tested the comfort of some of the 193 seats from French firm Quinette Gallay, with one gentleman who was reluctant to get up again commenting: \u0026#8216Just give me a shout when you\u0026#8217re leaving.\u0026#8217The tour continued upstairs to the balcony, where Mrs Davey pointed out the clouds painted on the roof, fitting in with the cinema\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216atmospheric\u0026#8217 status.\u0026#8216This is supposedly the closest we can get to the original,\u0026#8217 she said.She said that the cinema, once nicknamed the \u0026#8216flea pit\u0026#8217 due to its inferior stature compared to the Rex cinema, employed a pianist, Adam Ritchie Greig, when it first opened in 1913 to accompany the silent films.When \u0026#8216talkies\u0026#8217 started to become popular and his playing was no longer required, Mr Greig founded an orchestra which proved very popular for social events and functions.The tour continued into the new, second screen, which has 52 seats, with many comments on its intimate setting.The cinema operated continuously from when it first opened its doors until it closed in 2014, for three years, for £3.5 million of renovations.To find out even more take the next tours, on Tuesday August 14 and Thursday August 16, at 10.30am.Geraldine Davey, in the centre of the balcony of screen

nostalgia your story on the Dalintober Beach Regatta.Before leaving the town, some 17 years ago, I lived on High Askomil for 25 years and before that about eight years on Low Askomil, both overlooking the beach.Long before when I was a teenager I lived in one of the prefabs on Hillside Road.My friends and I would often head for Dalintober beach, commonly known as Banana Beach, where we would spend some pocket money on Jock Shields\u0026#8217 kayaks.There were about six or seven kayaks to hire for a shilling or two and go just about anywhere, in all weathers, for an hour, not a life jacket to be seen.Jock or John Shields ran a bicycle shop on Longrow but was into many things and also had a ship carousel at Banana Beach.The carousel wasn\u0026#8217t unlike one at the fair but consisted of seven or eight little cargo ships and cruise boats, all home made I think, for one child in each boat.They were attached to a centre spindle with one ship only having an outboard motor making the whole assembly rotate.I\u0026#8217m not sure if it was Jock or someone else who hired out rowing boats from the slipway in the harbour.We would hire two seater or four seater boats, the former being cheaper and we could always pick up another crew member when out of sight of the hirer.Rowing  to the large mooring buoy in the middle of the loch was no big deal, neither was accepting a dare to ride out the wake from the Duchess of Hamilton or Montrose sideways on.I\u0026#8217m sweating thinking about it as there were no lifejackets, we must have been crazy.Other memories of Banana Beach were the toilets and shelter at the top of the pier now long gone, and the push button drinking fountain at the wall near the beach slipway.Happy days indeed.  Good luck to those trying to restore it for today\u0026#8217s generation where I\u0026#8217m certain lifejackets will be in abundance for boating adventures.Ronnie Gay,Hunters Quay.The queue to have a go at Dalintober Beach Group\u0026#8217s

And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

The proposal to turn the library, which as built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0027s Aldhammer House, were first put to the public in June 2016.  But they were criticised by Prestonpans Community Council, which said merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation the local authority announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year stating \"the majority of respondents said that they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the Library building.\"  However the council has now said that following a service review\u0026nbspit will move a wide range of services into the library from Monday, August 27.  Housing services will continue to be dealt\u0026nbspwith at Aldhammer House.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \"As more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.\u0026nbsp  \"Meanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint Library/Area Office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.\""},{"url":null,"title":"council-staff-look-after-family-of-ducklings","story":"  The mother duck arrived at the courtyard at John Muir House and found an enclosed area where she was able to keep her young safe from predators however, it was lacking a pond.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed. I recognise the council is under pressure to make cuts but they should say that it what is about: saving money."},{"url":null,"title":"catriona-matthew-brings-solheim-cup-to-north-berwick","story":"  Matthew will captain the European team for the event \u0026ndash the female equivalent of the Ryder Cup \u0026ndash and was in her home town on Monday to start the countdown.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

Not only will it increase the availability of childcare, but it will create a significant number of new jobs in the town too.  \u0026ldquoThis is now a highly qualified and professional sector, and Pear Tree has a great track record on staff support and training, so these are excellent opportunities for local people.  \u0026ldquoWith childcare entitlement expanding and Haddington also increasing in size, this is a much-needed and welcome facility."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created.

Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.  The consultation runs to October 2, with drop-in sessions held at both schools next month.  Prestonpans Infant School hosts a consultation event on September 4 from noon to 5pm, with the primary school event taking place a week later between the same times.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.  The 20mph speed limit starts to the west of Edinburgh Road\u0026rsquos junction with Shore Road and Beveridge Row.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington.

Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoI found when I was at Trinity Academy, the headteacher and the senior leadership team were in the middle of the school.

She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.  Currently the school is undergoing a large-scale expansion, which is due to be fully complete in early November.  Ahead of the new term starting, a section of the extension has been opened, which will give access to six new classrooms.  More than \u0026pound10 million is being spent on the extension, which includes a new two-storey L-shaped block to the east side of the school.  It will not only be home to new classrooms but also a home economics department, new library and learning centre with a dedicated IT space, and additional PE changing rooms.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see.

Blair Nimmo, KPMG\u0026rsquos head of restructuring in the UK, said: \u0026ldquoHigh street estate agents are presently facing an unprecedented set of challenges.  \u0026ldquoThe rise of online-only\u0026nbspagencies have combined with falling house prices, a general slowdown in sale activity and a raft of legislative changes, all of which have generated headwinds for your average high street agent.  \u0026ldquoI would therefore not be surprised to see operators across this sector struggle over the second half of the year and beyond.  Profits at the likes of Foxtons have come under intense pressure recently, with the London property market slowing considerably since the Brext vote.  Britain\u0026rsquos biggest listed estate agency\u0026nbspCountrywide, which is behind Hamptons and Bairstow Eves,\u0026nbspis also in full-blown crisis as it seeks to raise emergency funding.  It comes as the rise of online firms such as Purplebricks, Emoov and Tepilo has eaten into the market share of bricks and mortar firms.  The high street has been pummelled this year by several high profile retail administrations and store closure programmes.  House of Fraser, Maplin and Toys R Us have all gone bust, while New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare have all shut stores.  The casual dining space has also come under pressure, with Jamie\u0026rsquos Italian and Byron among the firms to close restaurants.  \u0026ldquoWe continue to see companies in the casual dining and retail spaces battle hard in the face of changing consumer attitudes towards spending, coupled with increased costs as a result of the living wage and business rates pressures, Mr Nimmo said.  \u0026ldquoWhilst a number of chains have survived through the implementation of successful CVAs or via pre-pack administrations, inevitably there have been site closures and job losses across many parts of the country.  But a study by KPMG of notices in the London Gazette shows the total number of companies in England and Wales entering into administration during the second quarter of 2018 fell sharply.  A total of 302 companies went into administration between April and June 2018, compared with 347 in the previous quarter, a fall of 13%.  Year-on-year, the number was up from 297 administrations seen during the same period in 2017.  Mr Nimmo added: \u0026ldquoThe latest figures reflect a relatively positive picture for most businesses.  \u0026ldquoFor the most part, adopting a long-term cautious approach appears to be paying off for the majority of firms, although sectoral-specific challenges and broader global economic changes will inevitably force some businesses to reconsider their operations and potentially restructure their organisations to improve efficiencies."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8281061.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"43-of-uk-motorists-prefer-driving-on-the-continent-survey","story":"  Better road conditions, fewer traffic jams and cheaper fuel were among the reasons given for people preferring to drive on the other side of the Channel.

Council leaders described the increase as \u0026ldquoextremely worrying and called for a boost in local funding to help tackle the public health crisis.  The figures, from an audit published by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), reveal 715 people under the age of 25 received care for Type 2 diabetes from specialist paediatric units in England and Wales in 2016/17.  Of those children and young people, 78.6% were also obese.  This is an increase of 41% from 2013/14, when there were 507 cases.  The data only includes young people treated in paediatric units and not by their GP, and it is believed the true number of young people affected could be much higher.  Professor Russell Viner, president of the RCPCH, said: \u0026ldquoA rise in Type 2 diabetes of this magnitude is alarming and shows that the childhood obesity epidemic is starting to bite.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos also concerning that we might not be seeing the full picture.

Izzi Seccombe, chairwoman of the LGA\u0026rsquos community wellbeing board, said: \u0026ldquoThese figures are a sad indictment of how we have collectively failed as a society to tackle childhood obesity, one of the biggest health challenges we face.  \u0026ldquoType 2 diabetes typically develops in adults over the age of 40, so while still rare in children, it is extremely worrying that we are seeing more young people develop the condition.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe need urgent action now. Type 2 diabetes can be a lifelong debilitating illness and these figures will only multiply if we delay.  \u0026ldquoCouncils with their public health responsibilities are on the frontline fighting obesity but for this to work effectively they need to be properly resourced.  \u0026ldquoCutting their public health funding is short-sighted and undermines any attempt to help our children live healthy and fulfilling lives.  Almost half of those treated for Type 2 diabetes in paediatric units in 2016/17 were black or Asian, the figures also show, and the LGA said greater support is needed for ethnic minority groups.  Kathryn Kirchner, clinical advisor at Diabetes UK, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough there are a number of risk factors for Type 2 diabetes which are out of our control, one of the most important risk factors is being overweight or obese, which we are able to influence.  \u0026ldquoThese figures are a stark reminder that we have a collective responsibility to push for the actions outlined in the most recent chapter of Childhood Obesity Plan, including clearer and more consistent food labelling.  Type 2 diabetes can lead to a range of health problems such as heart disease, strokes and kidney problems.  Eustace de Sousa, from Public Health England, said: \u0026ldquoThe rise in type 2 diabetes in young children highlights why bold measures are needed to tackle childhood obesity \u0026ndash and change won\u0026rsquot happen overnight.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why we\u0026rsquore working with industry to make food healthier, we\u0026rsquove produced guidance for councils on planning healthier towns and we\u0026rsquore delivering campaigns encouraging people to choose healthier food and lead healthier lives.

The council said it is the first local authority in the UK to offer free sanitary provision in all of its public buildings.  It comes after the local authority introduced free sanitary products in its secondary schools last August, with young women accessing more than 13,000 free sanitary towels and tampons while at school in the last year.  Council leader Joe Cullinane said: \"Sanitary products are a necessity, not a choice.

In the meantime the campaigners say that the SFA should withdraw from the international matches.  The SPSC said in its petition: \"While the state of Israel continues to violate Palestinian rights with impunity...\u0026nbspthe SFA could make a significant contribution toward the goal of freedom for the Palestinian people and equal rights for all in Israel/Palestine.\"    But the SFA has said it has no plans to comply while the Israeli Embassy in London has said allegations made about Israel\u0027s actions were \"hate-laden\".  An SFA spokesman \u0026nbspsaid: \u0026ldquoWe are aware of the situation in the West Bank territory.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoWe have consulted with UEFA, under whose jurisdiction both competitive UEFA Nations League ties with Israel fall, and with FIFA as the world governing body of the game.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoWe note and agree with the positions of both organisations that interference, even in a football context, could potentially aggravate the situation and that football should remain politically neutral.  In June, Lionel Messi\u0027s Argentina called off a pre-World Cup exhibition match with Israel following political pressure and claims of threats towards players, sparking outrage from Israeli officials.  The head of the Palestinian football federation Jibril Rajoub had called on Arab and Muslim sports fans to burn photos and T-shirts of Lionel Messi if he attended the friendly.    The Palestinian FA said in a statement after the friendly had been called off: \u0026ldquoThe president of the Palestinian Federation of Football General Gabriel Rajoub confirmed that the Argentine Football Federation cancelled his game with Israel\u0026rsquos team... on the land of Jerusalem, as a result of the efforts of the Palestinians with the assistance of regional and international federations.  \u0026ldquoThe will of values, ethics and the message of sport had triumphed today, and the red card had been lifted in Israel\u0026rsquos face by cancelling this match.

The paper by Jewish Human Rights Watch, based on a study of comments made on social media by core supporters of the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign, claims that almost as many deny the Holocaust and liken it to a Jewish conspiracy theory.

He argued it would mean \"getting into bed with the billionaires\" by letting capitalism off the hook and entrenching power inequalities.  It comes after Nicola Sturgeon pledged to fund research into a universal basic income (UBI) last year, with \u0026pound250,000 set aside for potential pilots in four council areas. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also said pilots could be included in the next Labour manifesto.  Mr Kibasi was debating the issue at the Edinburgh International Book Festival with economist and basic income campaigner Annie Miller and economist and journalist Stewart Lansley.  Ms Miller, co-founder of Citizen\u0026rsquos Basic Income Network Scotland, suggested every adult could be paid \u0026pound162 a week. This would be funded by hiking income tax to at least 45%.  The IPPR previously said such a scheme would cost \u0026pound20 billion a year in Scotland and would risk making child poverty worse.  Agreeing the economy is in crisis and in need of fundamental reform, Mr Kibasi said a basic income was seductive \"precisely because it\u0027s a big idea, but the problem is that big ideas aren\u0027t necessarily good ideas\".  He added: \"My real objection to UBI is that it lets capitalism off the hook. It is giving in, it is embracing defeat.\"  He said the policy was widely supported by Silicon Valley tycoons such as Elon Musk, former Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg \u0026ndash as well as Richard Branson.  He continued: \"In politics you always get strange bedfellows \u0026ndash that\u0027s absolutely the case. But if you\u0027re going to get into bed with the billionaires, you\u0027ve got to ask yourself, \u0027Why are they in favour of it?\u0027  \"The reason is that UBI actually maintains unequal power relations.\"  He said introducing a basic income risked leaving 20 or 30 per cent of the population as a \u0026ldquodependent class, and insisted it was \u0026ldquotrying to attempt a form of kind of euthanasia for the working class as a political category and a political concept.  Dismissing the idea as \u0026ldquomagical thinking, he argued money should instead be spent on building good homes, boosting the budget of the NHS or improving schools.  He also insisted UBI would \"solidify and reinforce\" gender inequality, because women would come under pressure to stay at home and look after their children.  He added: \"UBI is to our economic problems what snake oil is to medicine.\"  Glasgow, Edinburgh, Fife and North Ayrshire councils are all considering basic income pilots.  They will be ready to begin their trials in March 2020 \u0026ndash subject to a final decision on whether or not the proposals are feasible.  Supporters deny the scheme is being held up as a \"silver bullet\" that will solve all of society\u0027s problems.  Ms Miller said UBI would help \"emancipate\" people and prevent poverty, and branded the current social security system \u0026ldquovery cruel.  But she said it would need to be introduced gradually to prevent disruption and allow the system to settle in.  She said UBI would live up to the four words engraved on the mace in the Scottish Parliament: justice, integrity, compassion and wisdom.  \"I can\u0027t think of a better foundation for a society than a basic income, bringing about some of these changes that I hope will happen,\" she added.

Isolated from each other, but connected with a communications network, the monitoring posts were built as an insurance policy against a day it was hoped would never come.  But as the threat of an atomic exchange receded, they fell into disuse and were abandoned as relics of a darker time, with few remaining intact today.  Yet now the secrets of one of the last nuclear monitoring post\u0026rsquos left in Scotland are to be revealed for the first time in more than 20 years through a project being undertaken to uncover the lost history of a remote part of the North East.    Little can be seen of the bunker above ground  At first glance, the fields of Inverharroch Farm on the Cabrach are an unlikely place for a stronghold from the height of the Cold War.  But it was from here that a three-man squad would watch mushroom clouds spreading from the ruins of Aberdeen, Dundee and other population centres if ther Soviets had ever launched their missiles.  There used to be ROC monitoring posts every 10-15 miles, with the Cabrach, which has been closed since 1992, site neighbouring those in Findhorn and Elgin.  George Anthony from Keith was a former group officer for the ROC and worked at the Drummuir site. He explained what the organisation was tasked to do.  He said: \"Ten thousand observers were part of the Royal Observer Corps around the country and I started out as an observer at a monitoring post in Drummuir. When I was promoted to group officer I looked after four posts in Moray.  \"If we came under attack, our job was to plot the flash going off and the pressure of the nuclear burst.  \"Even in peacetime we had to take readings from instruments every five to 10 minutes so each shift was very busy.  He added: \"There was no heating, though, and the only air was via a small vent and the access shaft, so you had to be hardy.\"    Access is provided through a deep shaft  Sunk 20 feet under the ground, the reinforced concrete bunkers were designed to survive an atomic blast, with access provided by a single ladder descending from a turf-covered steel manhole on the surface.  Inside, there was enough space for three servicemen to live for a period of up to three weeks after a nuclear attack, although conditions were cramped.  Each bunker comprised only a single room, with mapping and monitoring equipment crammed into the living space, along with an adjacent chemical toilet.  From here, the ROC officers would trace the shifting patterns of deadly radioactive fallout blowing on the wind and relay the information to larger underground centres, such as the Troywood bunker in Fife \u0026ndash a 24,000 sq ft facility now open as The Secret Bunker tourist attraction.    Conditions inside were cramped  Andy Fairgrieve from Dufftown, who also manages the arts programme of a nearby Speyside distillery, has visited more than 200 decommissioned nuclear bunkers around Scotland, Northern Ireland and the North East of England.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf you were on duty when the bombs dropped then you had to stay in the bunker. The data you provided would have helped the government to establish the effects on the country and to help any survivors.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe nuclear posts were located around 10 to 15 miles apart and were organised into clusters which communicated between themselves.  \u0026ldquoThe Cabrach bunker, or \u0026lsquoPost 32\u0026rsquo, was part of the Aberdeen Section. The UK\u0026rsquos network of bunkers were reorganised from 1968 onwards, with a number of them being closed down, although Post 32 remained operational until the early 1990\u0026rsquos when the Royal Observer Corps was stood down.  \u0026ldquoMost are now flooded, burned out or permanently locked by the landowner but this one remains in remarkably good condition and I\u0026rsquom really looking forward to showing people around it.  The bunker, which will be opened for one day on Saturday 18 August, is under the care of the Cabrach Trust, which plans to work with historians to convert the existing farm steading into a historically-accurate distillery, heritage centre and cafe as a significant new tourist attraction. All profits will be reinvested locally in jobs, housing and infrastructure.  \u0026ldquoHeritage isn\u0026rsquot just all about ancient history, said the Executive Director of The Cabrach Trust, Sue Savege.  \u0026ldquoThe nuclear bunker is part of the Cabrach\u0026rsquos very recent history and is a fascinating chapter in of the area\u0026rsquos long and interesting heritage. The story behind this bunker will eventually be documented alongside the rest of the history of the Cabrach in our new heritage centre.  \"The Open Day will give us an opportunity to give an update on how work is progressing on the heritage centre, and we\u0026rsquoll be offering a \u0026lsquovirtual tour\u0026rsquo of the site."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8251269.jpg?type=article-full","title":"fans-take-high-road-for-last-runrig-gigs","story":"  Tens of thousands of fans are this weekend making one last pilgrimage to hear Runrig play Loch Lomond.

I think we\u0026rsquore very proud of what we\u0026rsquove accomplished and we\u0026rsquore ready to give Scotland the show of a lifetime.  The Canadian, who has been touring with Runrig for 20 years, said of his time with the group: \u0026ldquoAll of it has been special. It\u0026rsquos almost impossible to pick certain highlights - it\u0026rsquos just been a great journey.  \u0026ldquoThe fans are are a family unto themselves and they are without question the driving force behind this band.  Since forming on Skye in 1973, Runrig have produced 14 studio albums and performed at Edinburgh Castle, the Royal Albert Hall and in New York\u0026rsquos Times Square.  They are hailed for their contribution to Scottish music, the Gaelic language and Scotland\u0026rsquos cultural identity. Though they were never entirely happy to be seen as a kitsch symbol of Scottishness.    Founding member Rory MacDonald said it is a love of performing that has kept the group going through the decades.  The bass player said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tended just to go from album to album, we\u0026rsquove never had a grand plan, or the idea we\u0026rsquore going to take over the world - none of that stuff.  \u0026ldquoVery early on, maybe after the third album, we knew very much that this was what we wanted to do with our lives. It wasn\u0026rsquot for fame or fortune, it was just that we loved playing music and playing together.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove always had that sense of being comfortable with what we\u0026rsquore doing. That\u0026rsquos the way it has worked for us.  Guitarist Malcolm Jones added: \u0026ldquoIf you\u0026rsquod said then that 45 years later we\u0026rsquod still be doing this, you\u0026rsquod have thought no way, not a chance.  Jones said concerts - called Last Dance - marked the end of an era for the band but other projects would continue, including looking after the group\u0026rsquos legacy.  Keyboard player Brian Hurren admitted there has been nerves ahead of the final concerts.  He said: \u0026ldquoI would say it\u0026rsquos unlike any other show I\u0026rsquove experienced with the band. I\u0026rsquove had sleepless nights and I\u0026rsquove had elation and excitement, sadness - everything. It\u0026rsquos been an incredible journey.  \u0026ldquoThere are a lot of fans that can\u0026rsquot get to see us because they\u0026rsquore in Australia or places that are just too far away, but they have been trying to make it over for this show, which is amazing.  Meeting the band ahead of the concerts, Scotland\u0026rsquos Deputy First Minister John Swinney thanked Runrig for their \u0026ldquoextraordinary contribution to Scotland\u0026rsquos cultural life.  He tweeted: \u0026ldquoA very special privilege to thank Runrig1973 on behalf of Scottish Government for all they have done to strengthen Scottish traditional music, the Gaelic language and Scotland in 45 years of amazing music.  \u0026ldquoThey have been such an important part of Scotland\u0026rsquos incredible journey.    Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos SNP colleague Pete Wishart MP formerly played keyboards for the band. Mr Wishart had said he would never join the SNP when interviewed in 1991.  Speaking to writer Peter Ross in last weekend\u0026rsquos Herald Magazine, Mr Wishart stressed his band\u0026rsquos part in helping Scotland learning to love and appreciate a sense of itself as confident and assertive. He added: \u0026ldquoAll the other political changes could never have happened without a feeling that what we have in Scotland is important and worth celebrating.  The band did not write Loch Lomond. But the traditional song\u0026rsquos lyrics may offer some consolation. \u0026ldquoThe broken heart it kens nae second spring again, it goes. \u0026ldquoThough the waeful may cease frae their grieving."},{"url":null,"title":"teachers-and-parents-sound-off-to-swinney-on-education-policy","story":"  Marie, a mother of twins, contacted a live radio phone-in with Mr Swinney to raise the treatment of her disabled daughter at school.  Now educating her children at home, Marie told the minister her daughter was given little or no help despite being unable to get dressed or go to the toilet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWhen there was no learning assistant about her class teacher asked her twin to take her to the toilet. Obviously at 10-years-old \u0026hellip both of them were very upset.  \u0026ldquoShe was left in the changing room, the teacher never got her changed, her twin had to do that, then got in trouble for taking too long.  \u0026ldquoIf she approached a supply teacher to ask for help they would say a child of her age should be able to get dressed herself.  Mr Swinney said her experiences were \u0026ldquototally unacceptable and pledged to look into the situation.  \u0026ldquoIndividual local authorities have got to make the assessment of how to fulfil the needs of individual children, but what you\u0026rsquove recounted to me is very clearly not acceptable, he said.  It was one of a number of difficult calls Mr Swinney fielded during his hour-long appearance on BBC Scotland\u0026rsquos Kaye Adams Show, hosted by Stephen Jardine.  Mr Swinney conceded it had been a challenging time in Scottish education and it was clear the parents, grandparents and teachers who phoned in from across the country shared that view.  Lesley, from the Scottish Borders, said pupils were being placed under too much exam pressure and were not taught properly.  She said her granddaughters had sat exams with questions that had not been covered by their school.  Mr Swinney stressed the importance of pupils being supported and said they should be fully taught courses.  \u0026ldquoBut they\u0026rsquore not, came the frustrated reply. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think the system is working and it is punishing children very badly. It is robbing them of their confidence.  Susan, a primary school teacher and headteacher for 39 years, accused Mr Swinney of failing to address workload pressures and teacher shortages.  She said the profession was \u0026ldquohaemorrhaging teachers because morale was \u0026ldquoso low, telling Mr Swinney: \u0026ldquoYou have a real crisis with recruitment and retention.  \u0026ldquoA number of my friends started out as teachers at the same time I did and out of all of those talented committed individuals I was the only one that lasted until 60.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot hear anything there that you have said this morning that would convince me that you have got a handle on this.  Another listener from North Lanarkshire texted to say her secondary school had been short of a chemistry teacher for five years.  Mr Swinney said he accepted teaching was demanding, but said he had engaged with teachers to reduce their workload.  He added: \u0026ldquoWhat we have got us a very challenging period in education. We have some staff shortages, he said.  Predictably, Mr Swinney was also put under pressure on primary school testing.  The Education Secretary said the assessments would help teachers identify issues as pupils progressed, but there was strong opposition.  Tommy, a teacher from the Highlands, said the tests jarred with current classroom practice.  \u0026ldquoThe requirement for recording assessments in primary school is bordering on the ridiculous. It\u0026rsquos another thing added to the list.  And Stuart, who starts a primary school teaching qualification on Monday, said he had \u0026ldquoreal worries arguing the tests were \u0026ldquonot needed and not wanted."},{"url":null,"title":"shining-a-spotlight-on-highs-and-lows-in-the-political-world","story":"  Brexit continued to dominate the political landscape, imperilling Theresa May\u0026rsquos leadership, and generating ever greater tensions between the UK and Scottish governments.

It comes amid complaints of an Edinburgh Tattoo performance being disturbed by the nearby Rag\u0026lsquoN\u0026rsquo Bone Man gig in Princes Street Gardens.  Controversy erupted last week over blackboards that prevent the public seeing ticketed concerts in the gardens, which could host up to 200 events a year when a new \u0026pound25 million arena is completed.  The association accused council chiefs of trying to commercialise \u0026ldquoevery square metre of the city centre.  Only the festival fireworks finale would be allowed in the gardens under the Cockburn\u0026rsquos vision for the beauty spot.  Chairman Cliff Hague said: \u0026ldquoLike many others, my concerns have grown, as it seems like every square metre of the city centre is being viewed as a means of raising revenue. This also links disruption such events cause before, during and after the event itself.  \u0026ldquoI have no problems with the fireworks at the end of the festival, which depend on the setting of the castle to add to the spectacle.  \u0026ldquoBut I am less convinced by the necessity to stage major pop and rock concerts.  A spokeswoman for the city council said: \u0026ldquoPrinces Street Gardens are so central to daily Edinburgh life \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos where we relax, play, eat and enjoy events \u0026ndash and I\u0026rsquom sure many people will want to have their say.  \u0026ldquoWhether you believe the gardens provide a fantastic backdrop for a set number of concerts or not, it\u0026rsquos really important that as many people as possible share their views.  \u0026ldquoThis is a citywide discussion about the vibrancy of the gardens and the role they play in Edinburgh\u0026rsquos cultural scene.  It comes as a music festival was told to take down a massive black-out fence blighting the city centre.

The council said it is the first local authority in the UK to offer free sanitary provision in all of its public buildings.  It comes after the local authority introduced free sanitary products in its secondary schools last August, with young women accessing more than 13,000 free sanitary towels and tampons while at school in the last year.    Council leader Joe Cullinane said: \"Sanitary products are a necessity, not a choice. I wish for no women or girl here in North Ayrshire to find themselves in the embarrassing and often degrading situation of having to use improper sanitary protection simply because they cannot afford it.  \"After all, periods are not exempt from poverty - they don\u0027t take account of what is in your pocket or purse.

He said: \u0026ldquoToo many young families are caught in a vicious cycle \u0026ndash a lack of affordable public housing forces people to rent privately and as a result many are paying rip-off rents which stops them saving for a deposit to buy their own home.  \u0026ldquoOur proposals for a Mary Barbour law will seek to regulate the private rented sector to ensure that no one is forced to rent a home that pushes them into poverty or falls below the standards needed to protect their physical and mental health and well-being.  \u0026ldquoA home is a basic fundamental human right. The Scottish Parliament must endure that that everyone can exercise this right to live in security, peace, and dignity.  \u0026ldquoWhile the SNP tinkers around the edges, Labour will deliver real change. The first step towards that is this a major discussion paper to guide our reforms.  Labour research showed the number of people living in poverty in the private rented sector has increased by 75 per cent in the last decade.  The party\u0026rsquos new discussion paper is targeted at housing groups, landlords and tenants and seeks to develop a better picture of the sector across Scotland.

The company, renowned for brewing oddly-named beers, are based just outside the town in a purpose-built brewery which also serves at its headquarters.                                                    James Ross, 47,  who worked in the warehouse advised the company he was suffering from an eye condition which meant he was losing his sight.                                                    The company’s response was to suspend him from his post in order to explore options, but then later sacked him, despite them having been advised by medical experts on the condition, that with some suitable adjustments to his working conditions, he could continue to be a valuable employee.        The employment tribunal which heard the case has now issued its ruling that BrewDog unlawfully discriminated against Mr Ross and treated him unfavourably because of his condition.The company, which has been valued at £1.8bn were told to pay compensation to Mr Ross in the sum of £12,052.New legislation which passed into law in 2015 prevented the tribunal from ordering that BrewDog staff undergo further equality training.A spokesman for the company said: “This was a really difficult situation for every member of our team involved in it, and clearly for the Tribunal panel too as their decision on the outcome was split.                                                                                                         “We worked with James in order to find a suitable alternative role within the business where his safety would not be compromised, but James wanted to keep his packaging role. “We ended up in a position where we had to balance James’ wishes with the best interests of the team around him, and while we regret that an agreement couldn’t be reached, we have a moral responsibility to prioritise the safety of our team. “We wish James all the best in his new role and his upcoming studies.”RNIB Scotland, which supports blind and partially sighted people, said: “Many employers still assume this group would be difficult or even impossible to employ.                                                                                                        “We know of journalists, teachers, bankers and physicists working in Scotland with sight loss.“It’s about encouraging employers to consider what people can do, not what they can’t.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"nicola is inspiring example of industry","story":"                And here in the north-east, the list includes the former police office in Kemnay.

Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Saturday 18 Aug 2018 12:44 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Saturday 18 Aug 2018 12:44 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland’s needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.”Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Scotland’s planned deposit return scheme is a landmark in the nation’s circular economy journey, with the potential to drive inward investment and create jobs in Scotland at the same time as improving recycling and reducing litter.\u0026#8221Consultation available to view.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Saturday 18 Aug 2018 12:45 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Saturday 18 Aug 2018 12:45 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The 3.6km section between Glendoe and Loch Tarff has been particularly challenging and would not have been possible without funding support from SSE, Highland Council and the Scottish Government and European Union totalling \u0026pound250,000, as well as the full support from Glendoe Estate over whose land the trail has been constructed. The opening of this section opens up the South Loch Ness Trail to more walkers, mountain bikers and horse riders and, particularly on this section of the trail, to those of limited mobility.\"Mr Ambrose added that the creation of the LochNess360\u0026deg trail will bring new opportunities for businesses, communities and deliver major economic benefit to the area in the long term.\"It will achieve this because it will attract visitors who may spend up to six to seven days completing the full circuit,\" he added. We know from feedback that there is already substantial interest from key European markets, particularly Germany, and VILN hope by spring 2019 to confidently go out to markets and promote it.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Saturday 18 Aug 2018 12:45 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Saturday 18 Aug 2018 12:45 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

This would be an organisation of first recourse that could advocate and lobby for the town and for what the town deserves.\"Mr Murray will talk about the plans at a business breakfast being held at Ross County Football Club.He added: \"Dingwall is a market town and we should develop and promote it as such to maximise every single opportunity available that can make a profit for our businesses and allow the town to thrive.\"People should be able to make a good living in their home town, and currently there is a feeling that despite serious setbacks, like parking charges, we are moving in the right direction.\"One of the big myths about Bid schemes is that they exist to tell businesses what to do.\"On the contrary, it is for businesses to tell us what they need done.

She said: \"All the neighbours were out watching. The road was like a volcano.\"She said: \"If they patch this now, it\u0026rsquoll only burst another six weeks down the line further down. It keeps bursting and they keep fixing it. It\u0026rsquos a nuisance and it\u0026rsquos been happening more and more often over the last few years. We\u0026rsquore also very concerned if there is asbestos.\"Sally Shepherd, who has lived in the area for 20 years, said: \"It must be more cost-effective long-term to repair the main. We\u0026rsquore also a bit concerned about the asbestos in the pipe. There are also patches all the way down the road. One burst in May at 5am cut off half of Tain.\"Councillor Alasdair Rhind voiced frustration over the pace of the clean-up and wants Scottish Water to replace a substantive length of pipe to combat a repeat. He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Saturday 18 Aug 2018 12:46 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"various apprenticeships ","story":" Radar Technician – SERCO – Unst\nApprenticeship vacancies are open to male and female applicants, candidates over age 25 will be considered for some vacancies.\nWages vary dependent on employer.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nSaturday 18 Aug 2018 12:46 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

The party’s spokesperson for Business, Enterprise andInnovation Maurice Quinlivan TD has announced proposals to increase the numberof people in apprenticeships to 60,000 by 2023, whilst also branding thecurrent government’s reform plans as “unambitious, uninspiring and unacceptablyslow”.\nThe document outlines Sinn Féin’s proposals to reform the system in ways suchas trebling the number of apprenticeship programmes currently availablealongside focusing on plans to increase the female \u0026amp people withdisabilities participation rates within the programmes. \nDeputy Maurice Quinlivan said\n “Thegovernment is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming theapprenticeship system. In 2017 just 391 people took part in newly establishedapprenticeship programmes, compared to the government’s target of 800.\n “Inaddition, only nine of the promised fifteen new apprenticeship programmes wereintroduced last year.”\n SinnFéin has also outlined the benefits of an all-Ireland apprenticeship system andthe benefits that would come with including trade unions in the development andgovernance of the programmes. The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning. Record numbers of students are attending third leveleducation, but with this route not being suitable for everyone, Sinn Féin wantsto create more alternative routes for young people.\nDeputyQuinlivan continued\n“AcrossIreland we lack significant alternative opportunities for young people topursue other education. We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people. To date, none of thismoney has been drawn down from the EU.”\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27460  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nLet\u0026#039s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0026#039s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nThis Saturday the 50th anniversary of the first organised civil rights march in the North will be marked with a commemoration march from Coalisland to Dungannon. \nThe original march, held on August 24, 1968, was the first to be organised by the Civil Rights Association in the north, which was founded the previous year to challenge the institutionalised discrimination and injustice of the Six County state. \nIt was stopped at an RUC cordon before it reached its destination at Market Square in Dungannon but the organisers went ahead with their protest and held speeches at sang the civil rights anthem, \u0027We Shall Overcome\u0027, at the police cordon. \nAn estimated 2,500 people took part in the original march fifty years ago. \nThe Coalisland to Dungannon march was followed by a march in Derry on October 5 1968 which was brutally attacked by the RUC. The attack on the marchers was carried out in front of the news cameras, brining global attention to the civil rights campaign and the the discrimination of the unionist regime at Stormont. \n\nThis Saturday\u0027s march, organised by Sinn Féin, is the first in a series of events planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the civil rights campaign. \nMid Ulster Sinn Féin MP, Francie Molloy, who helped organise and took part in the original parade 50 years ago, said that the campaign for rights is as relevant now as it was in 1968 and encouraged people to take part in Saturday\u0027s march. \n\"Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing and the ongoing issue of constituency boundary proposals, it is clear there is still a job of work to be done,\" he said. \nWith the DUP\u0027s denial of rights to the LGB\u0026ampT community, Irish language speakers and bereaved families awaiting inquests, it is clear the campaign for rights needs to continue in the north. The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05f-jpg.jpg","title":"65470  ","story":"    \nNORTHERN Ireland have been crowned World Champions after the local sailors took on the best from around the world for the Atlantic Challenge and won.\nTeams of young people from around the globe converged on Lough Neagh for the toughest test of endurance, strength and skill.\nThe Northern Ireland crew had an outstanding week in Antrim, with big wins in the two Jackstay Transfer tasks, traditional rope work, man overboard and the rowing slalom races.

Heart Foundation Northern Ireland (BHF NI).\n  \nMairead Agnew was inspired by her young neighbour Mark Lynn, who has complex congenital heart disease. At just 8 years old, he has undergone four open heart surgeries and numerous cardiac procedures. \n  \nIn 2015 Mark was diagnosed with heart failure but this still hasn’t stopped him and his parents Donna and Geoff supporting BHF NI and raising almost \u0026pound3,000 for the charity.\n  \nMairead explained: “My sister was born with congenital heart disease so this is a cause that has always been extremely close to mine and my family’s hearts. When I saw the wonderful fundraising that Mark and his family had raised, I wanted to do something to help. When I told Mark I was taking on the Berlin Marathon, he was sure he wanted us to support BHF NI once again.”\n  \nKaren McCammon, Health Services Engagement Lead for BHF NI explained: “When the BHF was founded in 1961, 8 out of every 10 babies born with congenital heart disease died before their first birthday. Our research has helped to turn this around, and now 8 out of 10 babies survive to adulthood. Breakthroughs such as these are only possible because of the support we receive from supporters like Mairead, Mark and his family. We are therefore extremely grateful for all their efforts.”\n  \nBHF have also developed pioneering surgical techniques to treat complex congenital defects. However, there is still much more work to be done. For children like Mark, who have complex congenital heart disease, treatment can be much more difficult.\n  \nMairead, Mark and his family are keen to raise as much awareness and funds as possible and are asking everyone to support in any way they can. You can donate to Mairead or Mark in person or call into any of the following businesses in Ballymena: The Moat Bar, Kockeden Lodge, Credit Union, Willy Allen’s Butchers, The Mace, Ballykeel Chemist, Molly Malone’s Chip Shop and A Star Valeting and Detailing, Ballymena who are running a special offer between August 16 and September 16 - offering full valets for just \u0026pound60 and \u0026pound70 for jeeps and 4x4\u0027s, \u0026pound2 of every full valet will be donated to the cause.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921264.jpg--.jpg?1534230306000\n","title":"plans to extend public realm scheme to greenvale street","story":"  \nPLANS are being considered to extend the Public Realm Scheme to Greenvale Street in Ballymena Town Centre.\n  \nHowever, one local business owner who has been based on the street for 20 years, has hit out at the lack of consultation around the proposals.\n  \nClaire Brennan of Oasis Hair Salon claims she has had to rely on “hearsay” in a bid to find out more about the plans.\n  \nNIE is currently carrying out utility works on the street which is expected to last four weeks.\n  \nClaire said: “I have heard that after the four weeks they are planning to rip the entire street up and replace it as part of the Public Realm Scheme. I understand that the work is expected to last right up until Christmas.\n  \n“My issue is firstly there has been no consultation, I don\u0027t know exactly what they are planning to do. \n  \n“We are relying on hearsay at the minute and I have heard that there are plans to lay stone similar to the rest of the town.” \n  \nClaire said she had written a letter to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council about the issue.\n  \nShe continued: “It took ten days to get a reply which said there was “nothing concrete at the minute”.\n  \nClaire said that among her concerns was that the area has a very slopping street which raises issues around what type of paving is used.\n  \nShe added: “Also there are concerns around water flowing down the street due to the slope and the fact that if the paving used is light in colour chewing gum, which will eventually cover it, will turn black and soon make the street look grubby and shabby.”\n  \nClaire said she would like to see either the street remain the same and be “brought back to its former glory” or be consulted on any proposed plans.\n  \n“We want to have a debate about it, not have to rely on hearsay.

Alan rounds off with some insights into the general history of dam-building in this country and relates how civil engineering has developed its own code of ethics over the 200 years since the foundation of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921285.jpg--.jpg?1534232428000\n","title":"estelle in the frame for spectacle wearer of year win","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman has been chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for Specsavers’ Spectacle Wearer of the Year.\n  \nEstelle Wallace, shortlisted in the 45 – 59 age category from Rasharkin could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning \u0026pound10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual awards. \n  \nGlasses wearers across the UK and Republic of Ireland have been showing off their specs style by sharing their selfies online.\n  \nEstelle, who is a health and wellness coach, was invited to visit her local Specsavers store in Fairhill Shopping Centre to receive a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a \u0026pound125 glasses voucher.\n  \nEstelle said: “I was really delighted to be shortlisted as a regional finalist.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

Their actions made history but Dungannon’s pivotal role in the quest for social justice was soon forgotten as images of beaten and bloodied marchers on the Duke Street march that October grabbed headlines around the world.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDungannon-born presenter Lynette Fay with Bernadette McAliskey during recording for Stories in Sound: In The Footsteps, due to be broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster this Sunday (August 19) at 12.30pm\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBorn in Dungannon only a decade later, presenter Lynette Fay had no idea that people she knew growing up – her brother’s primary school teacher, and her next door neighbours – were among the organisers of that first march.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn this Stories In Sound documentary for BBC Radio Ulster, she follows ‘In The Footsteps’ of those first civil rights marchers. She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost. Fifty years on from that first civil rights march, how has Dungannon – and Northern Ireland – changed?\n\nIn the Footsteps - presented by Lynette Fay and produced by Freya McClements – is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster on Sunday, August 19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602191.1534343875!/image/image.jpg","title":"fundraising in memory of elizabeth","story":"\nElizabeth Adams was an employee of Mountvale Private Nursing Home, Dromore for over 11 years, she was a work colleague but mainly a friend.  \n\n                \nAfter a short illness called Sarcoidosis, she passed away peacefully on January 15.

Since its formation in 1994, the initiative has sent over 2000 students from Northern Ireland to all four corners of the United States where they have successfully completed a year studying\n\nJonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland, added: “I am confident that the students departing for the US this year will be great ambassadors for Northern Ireland and will help to further important long-term links and connections. A recent report published by the British Council has highlighted that the relationship between the US and the UK is driven as much by cultural factors, as political with programmes such as Study USA supporting these links and strengthening them for the future. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Through Study USA, students will have the opportunity to not only enhance their employability skills but also develop intercultural skills, which will help them to prepare to work in a global economy. We wish them success, and trust that new connections and friendships will be developed in the year ahead.”\n\nStudy USA is just one of many international opportunities available through British Council Northern Ireland.

In addition, the company has faced an extremely challenging retail trading environment reflecting weak consumer confidence and reduced consumer spending. These factors have had a significant adverse impact on Homebase’s trading position.\n\n“After a comprehensive review, Homebase has concluded that its current store portfolio mix is no longer viable. Rental costs associated with stores are unsustainable and many stores are loss making.\n\n“The CVA enables Homebase to make essential changes to its store portfolio, reducing its cost base and providing a stable platform on which to continue its turnaround.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Under the terms of the CVA proposal, all creditors receive a better outcome than any other likely alternative.\n\n“It is anticipated that 42 stores will close during late 2018 and early 2019.\n\n“The proposed changes to the store portfolio will regrettably mean redundancies from those stores earmarked for closure. The process is expected to lead to a reduction of up to 1,500 roles, although every effort will be made to redeploy team members within the business where possible.\n\n“All stores in the UK and the Republic of Ireland will remain open for business as usual and this process will have no impact on customer purchases, outstanding orders or any product or service guarantees.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The creditors will vote on the CVA on 31 August 2018.”\n\nDamian McGloughlin, CEO of Homebase, said: “Launching a CVA has been a difficult decision and one that we have not taken lightly. Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the underperformance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs. The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.”\n\nStephanie Pollitt, Assistant Director of Real Estate Policy, British Property Federation (BPF), said: “These situations are never easy as property owners need to take into consideration the impact on their investors, including those protecting their investors’ pensioners’ savings, as they vote on the CVA proposal. Homebase and Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal have, however, demonstrated best practice, engaging with the BPF in the process and therefore ensuring property owners’ interests have been properly taken into account. Ultimately, it will be for individual property owners to decide how they will vote on the CVA, but the proposal has sought to find a solution that provides a sustainable future for Homebase.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8478809.1533901811!/image/image.jpg","title":"was speeding in hurry to get to work","story":"\nIn a hurry to get to work a 49-year-old man broke the speed limit in his van, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nAsen Asenov, whose address was given as Flush Place, Lurgan, was fined £75 for excess speed on May 30 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThree penalty points were also imposed and he was ordered to pay a £15 offender’s levy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor having a defective light on his vehicle he was fined £50.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe court heard that at 11.30pm on the Portadown Road in Lurgan police saw a Mercedes Sprinter van with a Bulgarian registration travelling in excess of the 40mph speed limit.\n\nThey followed the van for a distance of over half a mile and to keep up they were doing between 60mph and 65mph.\n\nPolice also noticed that the right rear side light was not working.\n\nThrough an interpreter Asenov said he had been rushing that day.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe explained that he had already received a warning about his job and he didn’t want to be late.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward. Young people, especially can access our services quite quickly so we would really encourage them to come forward.”\nIf you think you might benefit from talking to New Life, call 90 391630.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tribute call for elisha scott","story":"\n\nTHE\n public vote to name the new road leading to the Olympia Leisure Centre in Belfast is in its final week and SDLP Councillor Donal Lyons is encouraging people to ensure they have their say and to vote for \u0026#8216Elisha Scott Boulevard\u0026#8217.\n\nElisha Scott is a Liverpool football legend and was Belfast Celtic’s most successful manager who also took the club on their tour of the US in 1949 where they defeated the then British champions, Scotland.\n\nCllr Donal Lyons said: “The vote to name this new road closes on this Sunday and the 125th anniversary of Elisha Scott’s birth will be on the 24th of this month, just days after. \n\n“I’m glad that my proposal to name this road after Elisha Scott has been included because despite Elisha being one of the most successful footballers to have come from our city, awareness of his achievements has faded. \n\n“It’s my hope, that by naming this road after Elisha Scott that we can correct this and begin to give him the full and long overdue recognition he deserves.”\n\nGoalkeeper Scott was born just yards from this new road. Cllr Lyons said it It would be fitting if the road was named after one of Belfast’s greatest ever footballers.\n\n“After famously signing for Liverpool FC in 1912 for ‘£1 and the price of the boat trip’, Scott would be a key player in Anfield for an incredible 22 years, making 468 first-team appearances. He holds the record as Liverpool’s longest serving player to this day. The earliest recorded football chant was Liverpool fans cheering his name. Scott is widely considered the first King of the Kop. \n\n“But it’s not just his time in Liverpool that’s worthy of celebrating. Elisha returned to the Donegall Road in 1934 to become player-manager for Belfast Celtic. Over the following 14 years, he would secure 31 trophies with the Grand Old Team, including 10 Irish League titles, six Irish Cups and eight Gold Cups. Belfast Celtic were the powerhouse in local football and the club still retains a loyal and dedicated fan base. \n\n“Scott also knew what mattered in football and when challenged amid worsening sectarian tensions in the 1930s, for fielding a cross community team he responded in his trademark forthright style, ‘I don’t play Protestant players. I don’t play Catholic players. I play good players.’ Scott’s success as both player and manager secured his place in history but his dedication to his club, players and fans ensured his place as a legend of the game.”\n\nYou can vote online at https://dof.belfastcity.gov.uk/NameTheRoadVote/  or by emailing NameTheRoad@BelfastCity.gov.uk with Elisha Scott in the subject and including your name and address.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"75m rooftop running track plan for old belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"if id done anything that deserved resigning i would have done so already says ian paisley","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

He was also found to have breached rules on paid advocacy after lobbying then Prime Minister David Cameron on a UN resolution concerning human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC\u0027s Talkback, presenter William Crawley asked if he was considering resigning his position. \n\nHe responded: \"I have been very quiet about this since my apology in the House of Commons  - I have let that stand.\n\n\"The electors in North Antrim are now being petitioned.\n\n\"If I believed I had done anything that deserved me to resign my job I would not be there today - I think that answers the question.\"\n\nMr Paisley contacted the programme to talk about the benefits of road racing.

The motion of no confidence is the final item on the agenda.\n\nWhile the meeting was ongoing, the office of the Local Government Commissioner for Standards NI tweeted that an adjudication hearing will be held into a complaint concerning Mr Rodgers.\n\n\"The Commissioner has announced her intention to hold an Adjudication Hearing into a complaint that Alderman Jim Rodgers (Belfast City Council) breached the code in relation to the rule regarding the registration, disclosure and declaration of interests.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlliance councillor Michael Long\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesman for the commissioner confirmed it had received a complaint about Mr Rodgers but could not give any further detail.\n\nThere were rows over the height of a bonfire on the Bloomfield Walkway site in the run-up to July 11, when pyres across Northern Ireland are traditionally lit.\n\nBelfast City Council took a high court action against the Department for Infrastructure, which owns the land, to compel it to remove the pyre.\n\nHowever, amid tense scenes, bonfire builders set it alight before police and contractors could move in to remove it.\n\nLater, another bonfire at nearby Cluan Place was removed by contractors with police protection.\n\nMr Rodgers has been elected to Belfast City Council since 1993 and has served as Lord Mayor twice.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top 10 baby names in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster declines invitation to popes speech in dublin","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

leader and former Stormont First Minister said she would be away with her family at the time.\n\nThe Irish Government had asked her to attend a speech by the pontiff in Dublin Castle on Saturday August 25.\n\nA DUP statement said: “Mrs Foster appreciates the invitation but regretfully will be away with her family at that time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis will visit Ireland for the first time (Andrew Medichini/AP)\n\n\n\n\n“She particularly acknowledges the significance of this event for many Roman Catholics in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.”\n\nThe DUP was founded by fundamentalist firebrand preacher the Reverend Ian Paisley, who declared Pope John Paul II the anti-Christ when he addressed the European Parliament in 1988.\n\nMrs Foster has previously met the head of the Catholic church in Ireland, Archbishop of Armagh Eamon Martin.\n\nThe head of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Moderator Dr Charles McMullen, earlier said he was “very pleased” to accept an invitation to attend papal visit events at Dublin Castle and Croke Park.\n\nStormont powersharing between the DUP and Sinn Fein is suspended in a row over identity issues like the Irish language, during which Mrs Foster has faced criticism from republicans.\n\nShe has also met Irish speakers and watched Gaelic games as conciliatory gestures.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster turns down

We’ll have people here right up until hours before the Mass begins.\n\n“It will look very, very different in a week’s time when Pope Francis stands here on the altar and looks out at a sea of 500,000 people.”\n\nSinger and composer Fr Liam Lawton will have the honour of performing an originally composed psalm along with a choir of 3,000 people for Pope Francis.\n\n“I’ve been very privileged to have been asked to write the psalm of the day,” Fr Lawton said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeating being installed at the site in Phoenix Park (Laura Hutton/PA)\n\n\n\n\nThe psalm is called The Lord Hears The Cry Of The Poor.\n\n“It is basically very much in keeping with the theology of the Pope himself,” he said.\n\nOn a visit to the site on Friday, Fr Bryan Shortall said he was very excited about the event.\n\nAs a young boy he was one of the thousands who turned up to see Pope John Paul II in 1979.\n\n“It was absolutely amazing,” Fr Shortall said.\n\n“I kind of think that maybe that was the day – as my vocation percolated, I think that was the day that I felt that maybe I’d become a priest.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary morgues planned for popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"12 single square metres of land on earth that people would like","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It really captures the true spirit of the event which has always belonged to the people of this city who go to such great lengths to put on a show every year.\n\n“This year we also celebrate 400 years of the City’s magnificent Walls which play such a key part in our celebrations and we can look forward to another spellbinding celebration and an extended festival with plenty for everyone, young and old, to enjoy.\n\n“Be warned, accommodation always gets booked up fast, so anyone travelling should plan their trip now.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027243184\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\nAmong the regular highlights which draw thousands to the city each year, is the Awakening of the Walls, which makes a welcome return for 2018.\nAs we celebrate four centuries since the building of the city’s stunning ramparts, watch as they come alive with an illuminated animation trail on and around the City Walls from October 28-30.\n\nThe Guildhall will once again be at the centre of the celebrations with the magical Museum of the Moon bathing the Main Hall in its ethereal light for seven days, and where the Samhain Sessions will showcase some fantastic musical talent under its ghostly glow.\n\nUp to 1000 people will be taking part in the carnival parade which is always the main highlight of the programme and a mass community celebration for all. Following the spectacular carnival celebrations and fireworks finale on October 31st, just when you thought it was all over, on November 1st the Walls will once again become the setting for First Light, which will bring the community together for a special celebration of light, remembrance and renewal.\n\nAdd to this story-telling, ghost tours, the Jack-O-Lantern Festival, the Monster Funfair, Little Horrors, Shape Shifter costume and make up workshops and the haunted Harvest Market, and you have the secret formula for the best Halloween celebration in the world.\n\nLooking ahead to the event, Festivals and Events officer with Council, Liz Cunningham, said: “Tonight’s gathering of witches gives just a hint of what’s to come, and really shows how much the people of the city have made this celebration their own. We are thrilled that so many wicked witches turned up for some fun this evening. This year we’ve extended our programme, making it our biggest celebration to date, and we just look forward now to showing the world how it’s done.”\n\nYou can find out more about all the spooktacular
