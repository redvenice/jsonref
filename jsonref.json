Will it work?It’s Good Friday in Brisbane and most of the city is dead quiet, with pubs and clubs not opening until midnight due to Easter trading laws. In the inner suburb of West End, however, something very noisy is stirring.On a makeshift stage in a large room, a three-piece band called Hexmere is playing a raucous, raw brand of grindcore punk to a small crowd. There’s another gig planned for the following night, with many more people expected.These all-ages shows are being sporadically staged by the Outer Space art collective, which won the Brisbane city council’s tender to operate this 300-capacity venue for two years, rent-free. The space needs work. But it represents an experiment, a gamble and a new hope for the city’s youth culture.The fact that the city council chose to make the space available is important. Despite a rich history, live music in Brisbane, as in so many other cities around the world, struggles to survive against the pressures of gentrification, regulation and competition.The music industry’s inextricable links to alcohol and bars has left a dearth of venues accessible to under-18s, raising concerns about how the complex ecosystem that sustains a vibrant local music scene – comprising everything from record shops to independent labels to public radio – will reproduce itself without engaging audiences from a young age.Live from Outer Space is an attempt to buck that trend in Brisbane. Coordinator Alex Campbell watches Hexmere as sound technician Hannah buzzes around the room, checking noise levels and sonic balance. Campbell says she has encouraged women and non-binary people to get involved in the male-dominated space of sound engineering especially.In the crowd tonight are the three members of the Goon Sax, back home in Brisbane after seven months in Berlin. Their 19-year-old frontman, Louis Forster, is the son of the Go-Betweens’ Robert – less than half a mile from the venue, the Go Between Bridge s the Brisbane river. But surfing the city’s next wave hasn’t been easy, even for a band with such pedigree.While the Goon Sax’s members were under 18, the venues they played required them to be accompanied by a parent and to leave immediately after their set, while their friends were unable to attend.Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.“It’s cool something like this has opened up,” says Forster. “I know my sister’s psyched about it – she’s 16 and she’s coming tomorrow night. I was pretty frustrated by it when I was a kid growing up. I remember going to soundchecks and standing outside venues and listening, stuff like that.”Brisbane takes some pride in its musical past – another international export, the Saints, are the subject of a mural celebrating their achievements on the other side of the river, and the band’s guitarist Ed Kuepper has a local park named after him. But the council’s decision to back Outer Space represents a recognition of the need to invest in the city’s cultural future.“There’s all these young kids who don’t have any places to go,” says Louis Whelan, who is director of Outer Space’s all-ages live-music programme and also plays in his own band, the Mouldy Lovers. “Most events are really alcohol-focused. Playing somewhere where people are just going to get wasted, it’s not the same thing as playing where people want to see music.“If there’s a whole new generation of people who are much more engaged with the arts and music, then when they get out and they have disposable incomes, they’re going to go to galleries, to venues, to buy local bands’ music and start their own labels. I think there’s a lot of value in it.”It’s not just kids who are struggling to find places to play. In Sydney – once a live-music Mecca to rival London or New York – bands now struggle to play at all, with venues under pressure from soaring real estate prices, noise complaints, punitive regulations and a cosy relationship between government and developers. The city’s longest-serving live venue, The Basement – which, over 45 years, has hosted artists from Dizzy Gillespie to Prince – closed last week, though its owners are hopeful of finding other premises.The situation has become so difficult that the state of New South Wales is now holding a parliamentary inquiry. Dave Faulkner, singer and songwriter of enduring Australian garage band the Hoodoo Gurus, told the inquiry that live music was treated like the sex industry, “as something to be shunned. We employ so many people, we generate incredible amounts of money throughout the economy – and yet we’re treated so badly.”Faced with similar issues, music scenes around the world have been forced underground, into house parties or often illegal warehouse gigs, accessible only to those in the know. “It starts to get a bit worrying when kids are in those scenes,” says Emily Collins, managing director of the government-funded advocacy body MusicNSW. “We’d much rather them be in venues where we can make sure it’s safe and they can learn to love music in a safe and supporting environment. At warehouse parties there are no security guards, there’s no regulation, no one monitoring alcohol consumption. And they’re more focused on over-18 activities anyway – not that anyone is checking ID.”All-ages shows have a twofold benefit, says Collins: they foster a self-sustaining community of audiences and performers that in turn helps nurture a creative city. The sticking point, particularly in Australia, is breaking the nexus between music and alcohol.Venues, already under severe financial duress, are reluctant to put on events where no money is coming over the bar and the regulatory environment is forbidding. “There are multiple bodies that need to be satisfied, so there is considerable complexity, high costs and red tape in running a compliant venue,” says Julian Knowles, chair of MusicNSW and a professor of music at Macquarie University.“There is no ‘agent of change’ law in New South Wales that puts the responsibility on developers to soundproof new developments near music venues. If new residents make noise complaints, the venue is held accountable and must meet acoustic treatment costs, so it’s very risky for venue operators. At best, it erodes business confidence and at worst it can shut down venues entirely.”The introduction of controversial lockout laws in 2014, imposing curfews on venues in a bid to curb alcohol-related violence more associated with nightclubs than live music events, have been relaxed to some degree, but otherwise only worsened the operating environment.Against this backdrop, MusicNSW offers funding to promoters and venues to stage all-ages shows, but Collins says applications are few. “People say it’s too hard as a venue – $15,000 won’t cut it.”Often bands are paid literally out of beer takings. “They’re basically saying: the more heavy drinkers attend your gig, the better you’ll get paid,” says Ray Ahn, bass player of another longstanding punk band, the Hard-Ons. “With that kind of a working model, it’s harder to organise all-ages shows. Where’s the money going to come from?”The parliamentary inquiry underlines what a cautionary tale Sydney has become. Dave Faulkner said the city’s culture was dying. “When people come to Sydney they don’t just come to see the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, they also go to have a night out and to see music – it’s what I do when I go to London or New York. But Sydney has been doing everything it can to destroy those places of entertainment and turn them into apartment buildings.”In the late 70s and early 80s, hundreds of pubs and clubs throughout the city and suburbs kept artists busy, with major Australian bands such as Midnight Oil honing their live skills by playing upwards of 200 shows a year.From the late 80s to the early 90s, Ahn says, the Hard-Ons would often play an all-ages show in the afternoon and another for over-18s in the evening. Now, they might have played one all-ages show in Australia in the last 10 years. When the band tour Europe or Japan, though, it’s a different story.“A lot of the shows we do in Europe are in purpose-built halls that have the bar on the outside,” Ahn says. “Inside, there is no bar – it’s like a flat-ceilinged room with a massive PA and volunteers running around everywhere. So where are they getting the money from? They’re getting it from the city council.”The environment in Germany was more easygoing, says Louis Forster, even when he was younger. “I spent a lot of time there growing up, and I could always get into venues – it was never a problem. Parents would bring their kids to shows, which was really fantastic.”In Australia, Melbourne actively promotes itself as the live-music capital, and with good reason. A Deloitte study in 2011 valued the sector’s economic contribution at over half a billion dollars, with small venues providing the bulk of revenue and employment. Though many venues have closed in recent years, the value of investing in the live-music sector at grassroots level has long been recognised.The Push, a not-for-profit youth music organisation, has been operating in Victoria since 1986, providing a launch platform for countless bands. As well as all-ages shows, it puts on mentoring programmes and skills workshops.Shaad D’Souza, a music journalist who used to coordinate all-ages events for the organisation, notes that it is a cultural investment as well as a financial one. “Lots of kids, when they grow up they’ll only really go to big festivals or big arena shows because that’s all they’ve had access to,” he says. “Whereas if you’re investing in all-ages shows, they develop a relationship with venues, they develop a relationship with artists, and then they know: ‘I want to support my local scene.’ They want to go to smaller venues they don’t just want to go to arena shows or festivals.”At the end of the night, Alex Campbell’s band, Bad Bangers, will launch their EP. The band are in their 20s now. “But that’s kind of why we started this – because there weren’t many all-ages spaces when we were younger.”In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

From its earliest days, Sydney has wrestled with its history as an “unplanned” but naturally blessed city, where unchecked development competes with liveability and beauty.It was only in the late 1980s, when the tourist industry poured millions of dollars into “brand Sydney”, that the balance tipped towards the beautiful and it began its current life as a place of lifestyle and spectacle, where the annual New Year’s Eve fireworks, stretching along its once-industrial harbour past the Opera House, attract 1.6 million people each year. Over these last decades, Sydney has projected an image to the world of a brash, relaxed and confidently lovely city, where locals are just as likely as tourists to embrace its restaurants-with-a-view or paid climbs over the Harbour Bridge. But that self-image that Sydney has held on to so fiercely since then is teetering in the face of accelerated growth. Parks and streetscapes are being destroyed for major highway extensions, and new apartment complexes tower over old low-rise housing. Suburbs that have been left to sprawl for decades, especially at the city’s edges, are coming up hard against a lack of infrastructure. The result is a metropolis as car-centred as Los Angeles for the majority of its residents, with one of the 10 highest costs of living in the world where unaffordable house prices dominate conversation, schools are overcrowded, workers commute long distances, and public transport breaks down when it rains. In the last year testimonials by disenchanted residents fleeing for more liveable cities have become a new micro-genre in its newspapers: “Sydney, I love you, but you’re meaner than ever” “Why I’m leaving Sydney: the city that actively punishes people for living in it.”This inequality between centre and periphery is not peculiar to Sydney. It is also part of a global trend, in which populations are deserting leafier areas for the attractions of a denser inner city. At the same time, local history compounds the challenges Sydney faces: its notorious battle between chaos and control dates back to tensions between the convicts who built their own higgledy-piggledly houses on the cliffs to the west of the city’s early water source, and the colonial administrators to the east. “A city without a plan, save whatever planning was due to an errant goat,” was how town planning advocate J D Fitzgerald described Sydney in 1917. That is the context into which the Greater Sydney Commission (GSC) has just released its strategic regional plan, a vision for how the city can smooth those lines out over the next 40 years of growth and deliver the benefits more equally. It presents the region’s rapid expansion as an opportunity for “transformative urban renewal” that, if proactively harnessed, starting now, could ensure the Sydney of the not-too-distant future remains a global city which is both culturally erse and an economic powerhouse.  The language is positive, but what it proposes is radical. It will ide Sydney from one city, into three. Under the ambitious plan for “A Metropolis of Three Cities”, Sydney is to be reshaped into three separate but linked urban centres: an Eastern Harbour City focused on the existing central business district (CBD), a Central River City at its geographical centre to the west and, further west still, the Western Parkland City. The GSC’s proposal aims to rebalance the city from its historic orientation around its original CBD and into three connected but independently flourishing cities. Ideally, most residents will live within 30 minutes of their jobs, schools, healthcare and essential services. Affordable housing and improved mass transit will stimulate investment and jobs in new economic corridors.  “I think it’s a really brave plan,” says architect and urban designer Craig Allchin, who worked on the 2005 and 2010 metropolitan strategies that preceded it. “Everyone in the urban planning world is following its development because it’s such a fundamental rethinking. “It’s trying to solve all the things we’re worried about in the city: housing affordability, liveability, demographic change, population growth, climate change.” However, while the three-city metropolis may look like an about-turn in Sydney’s traditional orientation, it has roots that predate colonisation, according to the GSC’s chief commissioner. In her introduction, Lucy Turnbull writes that the city’s redrawn boundaries reflect Indigenous people’s relationships to the land as “saltwater country” (Eastern Harbour City), “muddy river country” (Central River City), and “running water country” (Western Parkland City).  The three-city metropolis is a shared vision, writes Turnbull, “bringing the depth of Aboriginal culture and custodianship to the fore in the future planning of Greater Sydney”. But guiding such a major rethinking into reality will require unprecedented collaboration and investment from all tiers of government. The GSC plan is unusual in the level of administrative reform that has already been put in place. Most significant is the Western Sydney City Deal agreed upon by federal, state and local governments. The single largest planning, investment and delivery partnership in Australia’s history, and aimed at delivering the new airport and connecting infrastructure in the Western Parkland City, it has genuine potential to counterbalance the pull of the eastern city.  It is this third, westernmost city that is the real game-changer. With three urban centres circling a planned second airport and “aerotropolis”, its mission is to be the most connected place in Australia. The GSC claims the Western Sydney airport will act as a catalyst for a new “Western Economic Corridor”, providing 28,000 direct and indirect jobs within five years of its 2026 opening. State and federal government have committed to at least the first phase of new mass transport routes. In particular, a new rail link running through the extended airport to its north and south will act, says architect Allchin, as “a kind of spine” for the new Western Parkland City. The whole endeavour is a huge proposition, he says, because by making the west a more affordable, erse and attractive place to live, Sydney has the potential to be unique among global cities, by breaking the pull of a primary city centre. Judith Ridge is already experiencing the benefits of the “30-minute city” lifestyle envisaged by the GSC. Nearly eight years ago she moved to Windsor, an early colonial settlement on the edge of the proposed Western Parkland City, to escape the gridlock of the inner west. Working as a teacher, she is saving the $80 a week she used to spend on tolls driving to work. She says the area is changing: its older, white and working-class population has been joined by inner-city renters, a handful of queer couples, and residents originally from China and Vietnam. Here on the semi-rural Sydney outskirts, they can afford to buy “an actual house”, says Ridge. While Windsor is economically depressed compared to the gentrifying suburbs nearby, it’s also escaped the encroachment of “cheek-by-jowl, shake-hands-with-your neighbour” housing estates, she notes – and she can see the stars at night. It may not last. In a city still strongly commited to growth, the population of Western Parkland City is projected to increase from 740,000 in 2016 to well over 1.5m by 2056, transformed into a “thriving, productive and sustainable area”, starting with the 24-hour, seven-day international airport. Yet, notes Prof Robert Freestone from the department of planning at the University of New South Wales, it remains unclear if the airport will be the vaunted catalyst for an economic boom – or even if it will attract domestic or international commercial airlines or freight. He has questioned how it can be expected to compete with the established Kingsford Smith Airport, one of the big earners along the Eastern Economic Corridor Sydney Airport Group has already turned down the first option to operate it. Details of the surrounding “aerotropolis” remain sketchy. Demand for new housing will also come at the expense of the space western Sydney currently offers. With the western district due to bear the brunt of the population growth, the plan has identified a need for 184,500 new homes there by 2036, and proposes releasing large tracts of land to form new walkable neighbourhoods close to public transport. These would be made up of “a range of housing types, tenures and price points” to provide for the different needs of the community, it specifies, with view to bringing prices down. But the enormous number of new houses needed to meet demand – 725,000 across the region by 2036, a minimum of 36,250 every year – will inevitably mean knocking down huge swathes of detached buildings to make room for more apartments. This is also the case for the Eastern Harbour City, where there are just 31 people per hectare by contrast, New York City’s five boroughs have an average density of 109 people per hectare. Building more apartments “can be perfectly valid, if people are given time to think about it and be part of the process”, says Allchin, but the plan does not spell it out explicitly and so misses the opportunity to lead from the front. The GSC envisages compact and innovative forms of housing on smaller lots than the traditional suburban quarter-acre block, but Allchin worries that the overall footprints of these new buildings tend to be bigger, meaning a sacrifice of green garden space. He would like to see bolder, more imaginative planning. “Really dense housing with lots of landscape around it”, for example, could become a world-leading new Sydney model. But convincing Sydneysiders to embrace apartments will be fraught, when there is already intense local resistance to galloping high-density housing, especially in the city’s much-loved inner enclaves and leafy garden suburbs. “Marrickville, not Mirvacville” runs one local campaign, playing on the name of a major developer, and nodding to the anxiety that Sydney’s very sense of place is at stake from a perceived long history of governments’ favouring developers over residents.Few locals, reading the GSC’s plans, will be able to put aside the stories of overdevelopment and graft that are a powerful thread in the city’s mythology: the dark side of its self-image. But there are other stories the plan omits. First, there is the question of whether its population boom is in fact inevitable. And the plan largely ignores sea-rise – a failure of imagination shared by most of the world’s coastal cities, but an incongruous one, given the breezy emphasis on other measures to increase resilience and adapting to climate change threats such as extreme heat. Last year the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association predicted global sea levels could rise by two metres by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions remain at their current levels. With 500 gigalitres of harbour stretching through its centre, this is potentially enough to make catastrophically literal the Australian poet Kenneth Slessor’s charming comparison of 1950s Sydney to Venice. Yet sea-rise rates just one mention on a single page of the plan, while the state government’s draft “coastal management plan” places a soothing emphasis on “adapting” to “pressures”. While the GSC at least commits to increasing the tree canopy of western Sydney, and preserving Indigenous heritage, farmland and natural landscapes, a fully imagined future plan for Sydney might have looked backwards to before the last glacier melt 21,000 years ago, when its coast stretched 26km further to the east, and the harbour was a steep river valley.  That last inundation is still remembered in Indigenous oral history, says Dennis Foley, a professor at Canberra University and Gai-mariagal author of Repossession of Our Spirit, a personal history of the clans of Sydney’s northern beaches. Once there were eight clans, he says, but when the water rose two “never came in – so we don’t talk about them”. These days most public events in Australia begin with a “Welcome to Country” from an Indigenous person, or an “Acknowledgement of Country” as part of a growing respect for traditional ownership. “Country” is a complex term, denoting Indigenous Australians’ land, sea, sky, rivers, seasons, plants, animals, belonging, and spirituality: to speak of one’s country is to speak of place, but also a spiritual connection. “Always was, always will be Aboriginal land” has become a rallying cry for recognition of land rights. Turnbull’s attempt to root the GSC’s plan in Indigenous knowledge may appear an attempt to make the huge changes being foisted on the city by the plan sound inevitable because they are historic. But when asked if the GSC’s three city isions map onto Indigenous knowledge, Foley says they “absolutely” do, in the sense that they reflect the fact that “the Sydney basin is a mixture of fresh and saltwater law, based in matrilineal law”.Unlike the central and western Aboriginal nations across the continent, which are mostly based on a patrilineal belief system, the eastern coastal Aboriginal Nations are matrilineal. “A complicated system of traditions exists within a small geographic area that includes the Georges, Parramatta and Lane Cove Rivers, where ecological convergence occurs between fresh water and salt water by natural occurring rock weirs,” says Foley. “The ecological convergence brings together two differing Aboriginal belief systems.” At the same time, he cautions against assuming a direct equivalence between Indigenous borders and the western concept of land boundaries. “For Aboriginal people, the concept of a border or ision is a moving, fluid site that can alter with natural phenomena, and the merger of Aboriginal groups due to marriage, drought, and more recently the violence and extirpation of culture by colonisation.” Prof Jakelin Troy, director of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research at the University of Sydney, says Turnbull’s three terms for country – saltwater, muddy river and running water country – are “news to her”. Aboriginal people, she says, usually talk about themselves as being from “salt”, “freshwater”, or “desert” country – or even “ice”, as her Ngarigu family’s country around the Snowy River is referred to. Nor, as far as she can remember, do these terms appear in the extinct local Sydney language, which she has revived from notebooks from the colony’s first years. Even if, Troy says cautiously, some Indigenous Sydneysiders are identifying through these terms, it would only be one of the great range of ways Aboriginal people talk about themselves after being forced to adjust territorial groupings by the violence of European invasion. The emphasis placed by both Foley and Troy on resilience in the face of great change suggests that Indigenous knowledge has a lot more to offer in guiding discussions of Sydney’s future than as an “original vision”, which, Turnbull claims, the GSC’s plan will fulfil.  A more genuine attempt to mirror the Indigenous relationship with Sydney, Troy says, would be to ask, “What is Sydney for Aboriginal people now – to ask them about caring for country and loving country, and still having sovereignty.” It may be that the greater ambition of the three-city plan is to model detachment in fast-paced and uncertain times, softening us up to change itself through abstraction. In the language of the GSC, bush becomes “open space”, suburbs are “metropolitan clusters”, and creeks “green corridors”. Even the clinical poetry of the three new city names suggests its architects are envisaging a level of change more appropriate to the world’s masterplanned new insta-cities – Tbilisi Sea New City, Abdullah Economic City in Saudi Arabia, or Singapore’s Forest City – and a future Sydney that, for all the talk of preserving its “Great Places”, will have to bid goodbye to its old self-image. Sydney has long ided itself into territories that are as much psychological as geographical, with the Eastern Suburbs standing as shorthand for “wealthy and self-involved” and the Inner West for “gentrified and left-wing” while the western suburbs – at least to outsiders – have been seen as Sydney’s disadvantaged, ethnically ided, crime ridden id. The GSC plans to drastically alter these old isions.  And yet, thanks partly to bigger changes sweeping the world, they are already giving way to new isions, especially a wider ide between rich and poor. Twenty-three kilometres west of downtown Sydney, Parramatta has been busy for some time transforming from Australia’s oldest inland city into a second metropolitan centre that will anchor the Central River City. High-rise around its large metro railway station, its long, bright streets also incorporate a convict prison, old fibro cottages and some of the colony’s earliest farms. Author Felicity Castagna lives here with her husband and two children. Once, she said, you would have been able to get the best feel for this vibrant, well-established suburb of old and new immigrants by sitting at the top of the pedestrianised main street. But now it is a hole, slated for a $2bn high-rise development of the City Square, as the city rebuilds itself around a “reactivated” river. “Even with all the new building, most work is being done by big corporations that have their own suite of people,” says Castagna, which cuts out local tradespeople. The development is not all bad – as a writer, it brings her in touch with more audiences, she says, which has been wonderful – but she mourns the working-class suburb of old. “Some of the families who live here used to have backyards – now they’re living seven to eight in apartment blocks, while apartments on the river are going for $3m.” One decked out in Versace furniture rents out for $500 a night. “You can pay extra money for people to come and serve you champagne,” she notes.Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live. Castagna has set two acclaimed novels in Parramatta, and has been a member of writing groups with a mission to reclaim the western suburbs from outside perceptions of it as a cultural wasteland. Castagna says western Sydney authors wrote first from a defensive desire to shine a positive light on the region, but more recently, have “started to work towards showing western Sydney in its massive socioeconomic and religious ersity, as very modern and contemporary”. And yet, interviewers sometimes still ask her: “How will readers relate to the west?” It remains to be seen how much the Sydney of 40 years’ time resembles the one set out by the GSC. But by proposing a plan that does not focus on its postcard harbour and CBD, and investing in areas it has previously left casually to spread, A Metropolis of Three Cities may see the old imaginative boundaries of Sydney disappear forever.In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

In the most recent edition, Melbourne was declared the world’s most liveable city for the seventh year running, with Adelaide fifth, Perth seventh, Sydney 11th and Brisbane 16th.Yet from long commutes and high car dependency to the low provision of affordable housing in the more appealing areas, Australian cities still have plenty of room for improvement.The Centre for Urban Research’s Creating Liveable Cities in Australia report provides the first baseline measure of liveability in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra, Darwin and Hobart. The result of five years of research, it examines walkability, public transport, public open spaces, housing affordability, commuting and access to food and alcohol.The walkability index combines dwelling density, daily-living destinations and street connectivity. It showed that a minority of residents in Australians cities live in walkable communities. With few exceptions, walkability is generally concentrated in inner suburbs. Despite the health and environmental benefits of walking, Australian cities are still being designed for cars. One notable exception was found: some new, walkable areas being built in outer-suburban Perth.In Sydney and Brisbane particularly, housing affordability stress is spread across large areas of the city. However, in all cities, those suburbs enduring the greatest stress were located towards the urban fringe. Given that outer suburbs also have poor access to public transport, and are less likely to be walkable, household expenditure on cars is likely to be higher there than in other areas. This suggests that continued suburban expansion will not improve housing affordability. Unlike other indicators of liveability, outer suburban areas mostly have better access to public open space than inner-city areas. Across Melbourne, Perth, Sydney and Brisbane, there are more fast-food outlets on average than supermarkets within 3.2km of residents’ homes.Previous research has shown that in Melbourne the density of off-licences in disadvantaged areas corresponded to poorer self-rated health. This reflects other Australian research showing that the density of alcohol outlets is associated with harmful alcohol consumption and alcohol-related violence, and that more alcohol outlets appear to be located in more disadvantaged areas.Due to difficulties in obtaining alcohol data, these indicators were created for only four cities: Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Sydney.

Reinstating the Irish border would be an enormous setbackTwenty years ago, the Good FridayBelfast agreement helped bring an end to decades of conflict and violence in Northern Ireland. It was a watershed moment – the result of diplomatic efforts within the halls of government and extraordinary actions of ordinary women and men who reached across longstanding and bitter ides.Today, the agreement stands not only as a local framework for shared understanding, but as a shining example of what’s possible when citizens come together to demand peace, and preserve it across generations. As the world celebrates this significant anniversary, we must also remain vigilant in protecting the agreement in the face of our current challenges – from the uncertainties heralded by Brexit to the hurdles posed by the impasse in devolved government in Northern Ireland – and do all we can to deliver on the unrealised aspirations of human rights and equality that were espoused that day in April 1998.Even now, I can picture clearly my husband’s first trip to Northern Ireland as president. On a cold winter night in 1995, Bill and I joined thousands of people at Belfast city hall for the lighting of the Christmas tree. As Catholics and Protestants alike came to that spot from their deeply ided neighbourhoods, there was no guarantee that violence wouldn’t break out yet they came with a sense of hope, after so many seasons of darkness.It was on that same trip that I first met some of the women whose names are too often forgotten, despite their vital role in the agreement. One of those women was Joyce McCartan, a Catholic mother whose 17-year-old son had been shot dead by a Protestant gunman. Joyce invited me to join women from both traditions at the safe house she had set up in a local fish and chip shop. We sat around a small table, drinking tea out of an old aluminium teapot, while the women told me how they had first reached across their ides to band together to stop the price of their children’s milk from going up. Along the way, they discovered that the deep-rooted causes of the violence – the terrors of sectarianism, the burdens of poverty, the despair of unemployment – touched all of their lives. In the end, for them and for so many women across Northern Ireland, love of family ran deeper than calls to hatred.Though they may not have made the headlines or the history books, those kitchen-table conversations were essential to the peace process. So were all the women who came together to form a coalition and claim a formal seat at the table – women like Avila Kilmurray, Monica McWilliams, Pearl Sagar, May Blood and so many more who moved mountains to help negotiate the Good Friday agreement years ago at Stormont.There are some who argue that the agreement has outlived its usefulness. They are wrong. Countless people in Northern Ireland are alive today, rather than in early graves, because of it. The last thing we can afford to do is become complacent, or delude ourselves into thinking our work is finished. In fact, 20 years later, crucial components of the agreement still have yet to be implemented. An integrated education system and support for community development, the promotion of the representation of women, and a bill of rights for Northern Ireland are all promises that have yet to be realised. The fact that the Civic Forum has fallen by the wayside is especially tragic, since it would offer a venue to discuss many of the urgent issues facing Northern Ireland today, including the possible outcomes of Brexit negotiations.These are difficult times for Northern Ireland, and for our world. As the Brexit debate rages on, I continue to believe in the value of the European Union, and of a Europe that is whole, free and at peace. But no matter the outcome of these discussions, we cannot allow Brexit to undermine the peace that people voted, fought and even died for. Reinstating the border would be an enormous setback, returning to the “bad old days” when communities would once again be set apart.Two decades ago, it was acknowledged that just as the Troubles didn’t start overnight, peace was never going to come overnight. Now, as the world celebrates this significant anniversary, the principles the agreement represented in the first place are more important than ever: a commitment to peace, prosperity and healing as the people of Northern Ireland build a shared future. As Avila and Monica recently wrote, if short-term interests take precedence over solving the long-term challenges that still exist in Northern Ireland, “then it is clear that the hand of history will be both heavy and unforgiving”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d1086160157799ffc10f2181916feda1bb92450/0_227_4735_2841/master/4735.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=691bf3b658a632ed8eb912ce8462c812 1240w","title":"centrist party politics reform womens equality","story":"As the leader of Britain’s newest political party, the Women’s Equality party, I thought I’d offer some reflections on the job ahead as you prepare to take the plunge with a new, centrist party.First of all – congratulations. You’ve fundraised 50 million quid already. No matter that according to one person close to your project you “don’t have a viable plan”.Money talks. Politics is built on it. Election campaigns are won with it. Trust me: I represent women, who make up most of Britain’s poorest people and generally don’t have millions of pounds to invest in a political system that has barely seen them. The fact that our party isn’t heard as much as I predict yours will be is directly related to the difference in our bank accounts.Second of all – you’ve got the perfect political profile for these anti-establishment times. You’re white, male and a businessman. Hey presto! You are perfectly placed to follow Donald Trump and Nigel Farage in persuading voters that really, you are just like them. This will be a particular advantage when the alternative centre-ground party that is also mobilising right now launches under the aegis of Tony Blair and disgruntled MPs.Third – you will have the grateful thanks of all of the other new political parties for taking the blame for “splitting the vote”. This criticism will be levelled at you mainly by the Labour party, but probably also by some Conservatives, given that you look like you’re planning to park some tanks on their lawn too. Don’t go thinking the vote belongs to the electorate. In fact it belongs to the two main parties who have taken it as their due for centuries and won’t hear otherwise. Good luck convincing them that they have to earn their votes.You have some very distinct advantages. But I think one of your disadvantages is perhaps a lack of strategy. So let’s examine at this point exactly what public need you are responding to.The country is split and ided as never before. Brexit seems inevitable, without us ever having the national conversation about fair immigration and investment that was promised. The Liberal Democrats staked their 2017 election hopes on being the party for remainers who wanted to stop Brexit. But remainers didn’t vote for them in big enough numbers and the experiment failed. Meanwhile right and left are polarised as never before. And after last year’s snap election, our first past the post voting system was condemned by the Electoral Reform Society as failing a erse electorate forced to choose between two camps and largely reduced to voting tactically. More than two-thirds of the total votes were wasted.Given all of the above, I have to say that a party backed by the same people who have formed and funded the current state of dysfunction isn’t really going to cut it. You’re not going to break the Westminster mould by scraping the mould from policies that aren’t working. It’s not a new party people want – it’s a whole new way of doing politics.And guess what, Simon – that whole new way of doing politics is right out there. Another movement for change has been swelling over the last year and a half. And this one is truly thrilling. A global Women’s March in January 2017 gave way to a huge uprising a #MeToo collective consciousness-raising that has breathed new life into politics. Radical political ideas, on the scale required to rescue us – investment in social infrastructure on a par with physical infrastructure, universal childcare and truly shared parenting, and a socially just immigration system – are beginning to find traction.New ways of doing politics are emerging too – the first thing the Women’s Equality party did after registering with the Electoral Commission was to throw our doors open to members of all other political parties and start mobilising activists who had never before been involved in politics.

Customers who belong to the myWaitrose loyalty scheme will still be able to get free tea or coffee from the stores’ self-service machines but will be instead be asked to use a refillable cup, the company said. The removal of disposable cups will initially take place in nine stores from 30 April as a trial for managing the changeover before the scheme is rolled out nationwide in a phased programme.The grocery chain said the move would save more than 52m cups a year across the UK. According to a recent report from the parliamentary environmental audit committee, the UK throws away 2.5bn disposable coffee cups a year. They cannot be recycled by normal systems because they are made from cardboard with a tightly bonded polyethylene liner, which is difficult to remove. As a result, just one in 400 cups is recycled.“We realise this is a major change, but we believe removing all takeaway disposable cups is the right thing to do for our business and are confident the majority of customers will support the environmental benefits,” said Tor Harris, head of sustainability and responsible sourcing at Waitrose. “It underlines our commitment to plastic and packaging reduction, and our aim is to deliver this as quickly as possible.”Trewin Restorick of the environmental charity Hubbub said: “This is a bold move by Waitrose that should be applauded. It is great to see a major retailer taking decisive action to cut waste in such a high profile part of their business.” The changes mean myWaitrose members will not be able to claim their free hot drink in the chain’s 180 in-store cafes, to avoid customers without a reusable cup who cannot use the self-service machines putting increased pressure on the catering areas. Instead, myWaitrose members who purchase a tea or coffee in a cafe will get a choice of food options free or with a significant discount. The shops in the trial are in Banbury, Billericay, Ipswich, Newmarket, Norwich, Sudbury, Wymondham, Upminster in London, and Fitzroy Street in Cambridge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c63181b682a9010ff70b454ecfe68fd3e01be23/0_133_3440_2065/master/3440.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7d1029ac502a0ccd7e5e3566919a4da2 1240w","title":"champions league manchester city liverpool preview","story":"Liverpool will be in box seat in Champions League second leg, with only seven teams in 126 having overturned a 3-0 deficitThey tell a story at Manchester City, going back to the days when European Cup quarter‑finals were for other clubs, about a time when Liverpool, in their pomp, turned up at Maine Road with all their trophies and continental experience and pushed their luck a bit too far.Those were the years when the Kop at Anfield was in its heyday. City, on the other hand, had a woman named Helen behind one goal whose gimmick was that she would ring a bell – and Ray Clemence found it so off-putting he called them up to complain that it should not be allowed. The Liverpool goalkeeper wanted Helen’s bell confiscated, not perhaps realising she was part of what the club was all about. Helen used to give the home keeper, Joe Corrigan, a sprig of lucky heather before each match and go into the players’ lounge afterwards to collect money for an old people’s home.Word of Clemence’s complaint seeped out and the next time Liverpool visited Maine Road there were more bell-ringers in the old North Stand than on an average Sunday at Manchester Cathedral.It is a lovely story, especially if you remember the days in football when it felt as if Liverpool had all the power, the biggest trophy cabinet, the noisiest crowd and the best team. City? Let us just say it was very different from the scene Jürgen Klopp, the current Liverpool manager, encountered when he arrived in Manchester for Champions League press-conference duties. In one of the quieter moments the German could be found in an upstairs room of City’s training ground, gazing out of the window with row after row of pristine football pitches as far as the eye could see. “Is this all City’s?” he wanted to know, and it was unmistakable envy in his voice. The answer was yes. “Wow! Very big, very good.” Melwood, Liverpool’s practice ground, must feel almost Lilliputian in comparison.None of which will greatly matter, of course, if Liverpool can reach the Champions League semi-finals at the expense of Pep Guardiola’s team and, with a 3-0 lead from the first leg, it would be remarkable if the opportunity was passed up.Barring a remarkable feat of escapology, that will leave City reflecting on a solitary semi-final appearance since the Abu Dhabi royal family started changing the landscape of English football in 2008. The 10th anniversary is coming up in September and the bad news for all City’s rivals is that Sheikh Mansour could feasibly still be in charge in another decade.Everybody knew what Guardiola meant when he said “sooner or later” City would win this competition. Yet it would still count as a failure of sorts given the expenditure and ambitions of the owners. Chelsea’s first decade under Roman Abramovich resulted in two finals – one victory, the other a penalty shootout defeat – and four other semi-finals.First things first, however, and Guardiola certainly did not sound as if he thought “the perfect game” was beyond the team chasing a minimum of three goals. “We have 90 minutes, plus extra time, and what we have shown this year is that we can create a lot of chances even in a few minutes. We know that and our opponents know that, too.”His message, he said, was “don’t give up, don’t give up, it’s more than 90 minutes – we will create many chances, then we have to be clinical and, OK, if we are not clinical, the next one, the next one, the next one”.Klopp was not referring to the Manchester weather when he said Liverpool could expect a “thunderstorm” and he made the point that City could conceivably have scored five or six in the first half alone against Manchester United on Saturday. Instead City then conceded three. “They have had a fantastic season, an outstanding season, but they are human beings, thank God,” he said. “They have had two results no one expected but we had to play at our best and United, for sure, had a bit of luck and used it.”Klopp’s cautionary tone was understandable when even a flicker of complacency, at this level, can be a killer. Take the case of Milan, for example, when a team featuring Kaka, Andriy Shevchenko, Cafu and Paolo Maldini won 4-1 against Deportivo La Coruña in 2004. “We were already thinking about the semis,” Andrea Pirlo later wrote in his autobiography. Deportivo won the return leg 4-0 and the holders were eliminated. “We forgot to play,” Pirlo added. “They were laughing at us that night.”Liverpool, chasing their first semi-final place in a decade, surely will not be so presumptuous when they are 17 points behind City in the Premier League. Klopp’s team also made full use of the away-goal rule to eliminate United in the Europa League two years ago, and should be optimistic of scoring again if Mohamed Salah is indeed fit enough to explore the theory that, when players run at Nicolás Otamendi, the centre-half can become a bran-tub of errors.Salah has had the beating of him every time they have met this season and, if that happens again, it could be decisive for a Liverpool team that has already scored 37 times in their previous 11 Champions League assignments."},{"url":null,"title":"jurgen klopp liverpool champions league quarter final manchester city","story":"• Manager insists ‘this is half-time: the game is not over’• Mohamed Salah expected to start after missing derbyJürgen Klopp believes that Liverpool must be prepared to weather “a thunderstorm” from Manchester City as they bid to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time since 2008.Liverpool take a 3-0 advantage into the quarter-final second leg at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday – a scoreline that their manager admits surprised him – and have never been eliminated from Europe after recording a three-goal first-leg lead. Klopp’s team did, however, blow a three-goal advantage at Sevilla in the group stage while City have scored at least three goals in 12 home games this season, and the Liverpool manager expects Pep Guardiola’s side to start with the same intensity as in the derby against Manchester United on Saturday.“We can go through all scenarios – they score early, we score early, all that stuff – but it is not to plan like this. I can tell the boys ‘Score early!’ but I’m not sure that really helps. We have to think about football – what we have to do, where we have to do it. This is half-time. It was the same at half-time in Anfield: the game is not over. We were in the lead, nothing else. Being in the lead is not winning. We are still in the lead but we didn’t win so far. We need a little bit more from this game.”The Liverpool manager insisted his plan “is all about winning the game again” and it would be a mistake to try to defend a 3-0 lead against City. Despite the clear advantage, and having denied the highest‑scoring team in the Premier League a single shot on target at Anfield, Klopp maintains there is no added pressure on his players. “I always see it as two legs are one game,” he said.“We are in a 3-0 lead. That is better than I would have expected. If you would have told me 10 days ago that this was possible I would have said: ‘Don’t think so.’ I am not putting pressure on ourselves. We are so close. Our situation is not the easiest situation in world football, we are not flying with a full squad, but we stick together and we want to go as far as possible.”The Liverpool captain, Jordan Henderson, is suspended for the second leg while the leading goalscorer Mohamed Salah missed the Merseyside derby on Saturday with a groin problem. But the Egypt international trained at Melwood on Monday and is expected to start at the Etihad Stadium. Klopp said: “He and Alberto Moreno trained with the athletic coach yesterday and afterwards both said: ‘We will be fine.’ We will have to see after the session.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7600c5b0a5391f88bd67b9113587e6762a3017d9/0_116_992_595/master/992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2be65a9356323b70ccb0032228666193 1240w","title":"barry bennell appeal against 30 year sentence","story":"• Former football coach seeks lighter punishment• 64-year-old faces complaints from around 90 former playersBarry Bennell, the former football coach who was branded “sheer evil” and the “devil incarnate” after subjecting junior footballers from Manchester City and Crewe Alexandra to hundreds of sexual offences, is appealing against his 30-year prison sentence.Bennell, still facing complaints from around 90 former players, has begun the legal process to argue he deserves a lesser sentence after a jury at Liverpool crown court found him guilty of 50 offences relating to 12 junior players, aged eight to 14, from 1979 to 1990.The judge, Clement Goldstone QC, passed sentences totalling 454 years, to run concurrently, and told Bennell he would serve the longest inidual term of 30 years, with another 12 months on licence. Bennell, 64, will be eligible for an early release after 15 years but is preparing a case to argue the sentence was excessive.Passing sentence in February, the judge told Bennell a life sentence had been considered because of the “trail of psychological devastation” suffered by the victims and that the severity of the sentence was, in part, because the former coach and talent-spotter had shown no remorse.“Your behaviour towards these boys in grooming and seducing them to, in some cases, the most serious, degrading and humiliating abuse was sheer evil,” Goldstone told him. “You appeared as a god who had it in his gift to help fulfil their ambitions and realise their dreams. In reality you were the devil incarnate. You stole their childhoods and their innocence to satisfy your own perversion.”Bennell, described by the prosecution as an “industrial-scale child molester” and a “predatory and determined paedophile”, has previously served two prison sentences in England, as well as one in the United States, and the judge said the CPS would have to think carefully about pressing more charges when the defendant “may well die in prison”.Eleanor Laws, the barrister defending Bennell, said her client was in remission from cancer, having needed two operations to remove tumours, and was subject to an “onerous” regime that meant he had to be fed via a tube eight times a day. To audible disquiet from the public gallery she said he was on anti-anxiety medication and had undertaken treatment programmes to deal with his paedophilia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88b9308dd831263eb396e4ae103c64d8b503b321/0_1070_4432_3225/master/4432.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f9e1e07af54d3c69f417c0b9ffe0350f 1240w","title":"nigel slater broccoli lentils and burrata recipe","story":"Chilli-spiked greens cooled by creamy Italian cheeseCook 80g of small dark green lentils, such as Le Puy, in deep, lightly salted boiling water for about 20 minutes or until tender but toothsome.

And when it comes to children’s magazines, the problem is even worse Women’s magazine editors have always understood the importance of a good cover. An illustration of Queen Victoria’s bust, surrounded by stylish women behaving as domestic role models, was credited with propelling Mrs Beeton’s The Englishwoman’s Domestic Magazine to bestseller status in 1857, earning it “more patrons than any other magazine in the Empire”, one newspaper said. As a mixed-race girl growing up in Britain in the 1990s, I might have still been in the era of empire, as far as my relationship with popular magazines was concerned. Yes, I bought Just Seventeen, More, Marie Claire, Elle and Vogue, but the fact that I – and thousands of other women and girls of colour like me – spent our money on glossies did not mean they catered for us. Through ignorance and indifference, they frequently featured no one of black, Asian, mixed or any other ethnic minority heritage from cover to cover, while advice on makeup, skin care, hair styles and products was unfailingly irrelevant to us.New research by the Guardian’s data team shows how little has changed. The covers of some the UK’s most popular monthlies remain overwhelmingly white.For our study, we looked only at publications whose covers mostly featured people and based our calculations on covers that show only one person. The picture is similar if “multi-person” covers are included. The representation problem is not confined to women’s magazines. While GQ featured two black cover models over the year, the other men’s magazine in our study, Men’s Health, had just one. Neither publication featured men from any other minority background.The inclusion of children’s and men’s titles in the Guardian’s research shines a greater light on the state of ersity in magazines, a debate that usually centres on a smaller number of women’s glossy magazines and especially British Vogue. During its former editor Alexandra Shulman’s 25 years at the helm, only two black women were given solo covers. Shulman said in 2012 that, “in a society where the mass of the consumers are white and where, on the whole, mainstream ideas sell, it’s unlikely there will be a huge rise in the number of leading black models”.When Shulman stepped down in 2017, making way for UK Vogue’s first black editor, Edward Enninful, her leaving photo depicted an all-white editorial staff at the magazine.Enninful rebooted interest in the magazine, with a much-celebrated first cover featuring British Ghanaian model Adwoa Aboah – a confident decision that may have stemmed from Enninful’s time at Italian Vogue, where the first ever “black issue” sold so well that an extra 60,000 copies had to be printed. The magazine’s most recent cover headlined “New Frontiers”, was also praised for featuring a erse range of models including Halima Aden, the first woman to wear a hijab on the magazine’s cover.Vanity Fair in the US, meanwhile, has repeatedly come in for criticism for its Hollywood covers – Annie Leibowitz photo shoots depicting an array of A-list actors in a spread that is intended to depict the state of the movie industry. “Young Hollywood is thin, white,” ran one critical headline in response to the magazine’s 2010 cover, which did not feature a single person of colour. Recent years have seen a push for ersity, with the 2017 cover featuring mixed-heritage Irish actor Ruth Negga, Lupita Nyong’o and Janelle Monáe. The magazine’s new editor, Radhika Jones, signalled a further change of intent by putting Lena Waithe, the black (and gay) actor and writer, on the April edition.But the Guardian’s data suggests focus on changes at Vogue and Vanity Fair has obscured failings elsewhere. “The industry is still overwhelmingly homogenous,” says a senior figure from an ethnic minority background working at another UK magazine, who did not want to be named. “Obviously, the appointment of Edward at Vogue is amazing, but that doesn’t change the fact that magazines are still incredibly white and middle class.”One obvious indicator of the historic failure of the biggest glossy titles to cater for black and Asian women has been the mushrooming of magazines aimed directly at them. From long-established magazines such as Pride and Black Beauty and Hair to new black platforms such as Black Ballad, Gal-Dem, Glam Africa, and Skin Deep, and Asian titles such as Asian Woman, DesiMag and Burnt Roti, women of colour have been reaching for magazines that normalise their look and the issues facing their communities.“Growing up, I would pick up magazines, and I never saw anybody who looked like me,” says Afua Adom, former editor of Pride. “I was really into music, so I used to read Smash Hits and magazines like that I never saw a person who looked like me. And where I lived in Scotland there was no one who looked like me anywhere. My mum subscribed to Pride, and that’s why I wanted to work there all those years ago – because it was the only magazine I saw full of women who looked like me.”The mainstream magazines are little better than they used to be. “You flick through any title and there’s a page that’s got shampoos and stuff and there’s nothing for afro hair, or there are no beauty solutions for darker skins, or there’s no skincare for darker skin,” Adom says. “It’s like that all the time. And you just think: ‘The way that you’ve alienated so many women who pick up this magazine so quickly, there’s no thought process there at all.’”One of the magazines I read while growing up was Marie Claire, which remains one of the UK’s bestselling women’s monthlies. Although its content is more erse than it was, its covers did not feature a single non-white model in 2017.I tell Trish Halpin, Marie Claire’s editor in chief, of my surprise that the magazine is still failing to speak to women like me on its covers.Halpin agrees that the magazine’s record is problematic, but she says editors lack control over the timing of their cover stars. “We changed from model covers about 15, 20 years ago,” she says. “It’s now very much about that A-list star on the cover that’s going to sell the magazine on the newsstand. We start with a wishlist of essentially very recognisable stars, within a particular demographic of the age of women we are speaking to – early 20s, to late 30s, early 40s. Within that wishlist, there are definitely a good number of black women and women of colour. But it’s not that easy to get them. We are experiencing the trickle effect – there still isn’t a big enough pool. We had two black actresses lined up for 2017, but their publicist decided to go with other titles. We are hoping we are going to secure one of those for our summer covers next year.”I approached three other editors, who didn’t wish to go on the record. But other senior figures in the industry say the Guardian’s research reflects a relatively small pool of BAME A-list stars, linked to a wider inability in the film and fashion industries to recognise BAME talent. Yet over the decades magazine editors have proved their ability to shape perceptions as much as to reflect them. They are the ones who decide who is “cover-worthy”.All of the magazine industry figures I spoke to, while admitting shortcomings in cover ersity, pointed to significant change inside magazines. Halpin said that, in relation to Marie Claire, it was important to judge the magazine by its content as well.“You’ll see a very different story there,” she says. “At Marie Claire, we used 17 models of colour – which is probably about a third to a quarter of all of the models that we shoot.”The change inside magazines is one I have noticed, and one that would have gone a long way towards alleviating my own anxiety of otherness, had it been the case when I was a young magazine reader. Greater use of models of colour on inside pages reflects the progress being made across the fashion industry. The website Fashion Spot reported a rise in ersity in global fashion in 2017, with the big fashion capitals of New York, Milan, Paris and London all featuring more women of colour than in previous years.But covers matter. Those who appear on them are the ambassadors of beauty, success and commercial appeal. For those who scan magazine racks, the impression of whose faces are projected out on to a shop floor has a visceral impact – and the choices of whose faces those are reverberate, influencing others. There’s a danger, too, that ersifying the models inside magazines while the covers remain white sends a new message of hierarchical beauty standards – suggesting women of colour have their place, and it’s not on the cover.Internationally, according to the Fashion Spot, cover stars are becoming more racially erse. Six of the 10 most booked cover stars in 2017 were women of colour, such as Dutch-Egyptian-Moroccan model Imaan Hammam. Adwoa Aboah graced eight international covers Rihanna featured on seven.This makes the tendency of some editors – who have historically passed the buck elsewhere within the fashion industry – seem harder to sustain. “Black models don’t sell magazines,” Jourdan Dunn, one of the most recognisable fashion faces in the UK, was told when she inquired about the absence of other black women from a high-end fashion magazine in 2013. Yet their current popularity on the catwalk suggests that they could.The magazine industry’s reluctance to put BAME women on its covers is not the only way it is failing the public. The situation is even worse regarding larger, older and transgender models. But there are numerous firsthand accounts of the way in which representation of race has a particularly negative effect on black women.Nyong’o, for example, has spoken candidly about the impact black supermodel Alek Wek had on her shortly before she won her first Oscar. “She was dark as night, she was on all of the runways and in every magazine, and everyone was talking about how beautiful she was,” Nyong’o has said. “My complexion had always been an obstacle to overcome … When I saw Alek … I had a spring in my step because I felt more seen, more appreciated by the far away gatekeepers of beauty.” Nyong’o – and the other members of the tiny group of women of colour who do feature on magazine covers – are still overcoming these obstacles. In 2017, two magazines – the Evening Standard magazine and Grazia – infuriated black women in particular when they airbrushed out the more visible elements of black hairstyles from cover models’ looks. “I remember the Lupita Nyong’o cover where Grazia just airbrushed her afro out,” says Adom. “I was so disappointed, because I really love that title – I buy it all the time. And they took such a long a long time to apologise … I just thought: ‘You guys just don’t get it.’”As the country becomes increasingly erse – more than a quarter of schoolchildren in England are from ethnic minority groups – it is of special concern that this is not being reflected in magazine covers. Corinna Shaffer, editorial director of Immediate Media, which publishes 21 children’s magazine titles, including all but one of those featured in the Guardian study, acknowledges more needs to be done.It’s interesting that Shaffer mentions tokenism. Across the industry, there’s a concern that crude attempts to remedy a lack of ersity in magazine covers will do more harm than good.“I have sat in meetings at some publications where someone has said, ‘Oh, we haven’t got a black person in the May edition – we need to figure that out,’” says one source at a women’s magazine. “When I hear that, it tells me you are not getting it right – that is just tokenistic. We need to talk about the underlying reasons why black women are not finding themselves on the covers, as they undeniably should, through the normal process.”“You don’t have to have a erse team to have erse magazine covers, but when you do, ersity is a natural outflow of that. You have people who have different points of view and opinion – a more well-rounded mix,” the source adds. “We are not even getting people from a erse range of backgrounds applying for positions at a senior level.”The failure of magazines to recruit from a wide pool of journalists – particularly in erse cities such as London – creates a vicious cycle in which unreflective newsrooms continue to produce unreflective editorial and cover content, further alienating readers from different backgrounds.“The erasure of black and brown people from magazine covers is part of a much broader process of “othering” – it reinforces the idea that people of colour are not the norm,” says writer and critic Maya Goodfellow. “What should concern us all is the multifaceted impact this has on notions of race in the UK and the idea it creates that people of colour don’t belong.”It is also bad business. In these challenging economic times, neither publishers nor the advertisers on whom they rely can afford to turn away ethnic minority women who, figures show, spend a disproportionate amount on beauty and cosmetic products.If my teenage experience is anything to go by, the images magazines choose to place on their covers are incredibly influential, not just reflecting trends and celebrity in other industries, but setting them. When it comes to representation of people of colour, it is a responsibility, and an opportunity, that they could do much more to harness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0757ab55701b88b9275fc32f74043dd64715bc1/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9068c073c9b300ac53a5659c119aa3e6 1240w","title":"smart meter solar power income fault","story":"We’ve been losing income from our solar panels since it was installedWe have a problem with our energy supplier, Green Star. In February it offered us the free installation of a smart meter, and it seemed like a good idea to go ahead. A young man changed both the electricity and gas meters. He was only here for a very short time, even though he initially expressed concern that it would be impossible to fit a new gas meter because of the lead piping attached to the old one.A week later, on a sunny day, I noticed that our wireless “Sunny Boy” meter was recording no energy generated by our eight solar panels. Further investigation revealed that the inverter, that processes \u0026nbspthe energy produced, had stopped working\u0026nbspdue to a “voltage error”. It happened at the exact time that the smart meter installation was going\u0026nbspon, so I feel it is safe to assume that the two incidents are\u0026nbspconnected.Since then, I have been trying to get Green Star to come and rectify the problem. I keep getting told that the matter will be addressed in the next seven days but nothing happens. We are losing out on the income that the panels should be producing. NB, LeicesterGreen Star Energy – one of the challenger suppliers – told us that of the many smart meters the installation company has fitted, this is the first time it has seen such an issue. It confirmed that the inverter cut out as a safety feature. It has now sent a team member to visit your home to reset the safety device. This did not work, so it has arranged for an engineer to attend.It has also apologised for failing to respond quickly enough and said that it will make up any income lost as a result, although given that the sun has barely appeared in the last few months, that won’t be a huge amount.On a wider issue, I would strongly advise readers to be cautious of having a smart meter installed, unless you get a written guarantee that it will be a second generation, Smets2 version.It emerged in February that only 80 of these improved meters that allow easy switching, and better remote reading, had so far been installed in the UK. Over 9m of the Smets1 meters are in UK homes, but users have found\u0026nbspthat after they switched supplier, they lost the meter’s smart functions. The meter then had to be read manually.The whole thing is a giant, expensive mess.

I sit on the floor of my family’s modest living room in a sleepy suburb in Ireland, my tongue contorting around my teeth in concentration as I apply a finishing layer of glitter to my masterpiece. It is my 14th year of life and also the 14th time in an hour that I’ve hit the replay button on my big sister’s CD player. A mere month before this scene, Lady Gaga had exploded out of obscurity – it is her image my younger self is reproducing in card and glitter, while Just Dance, released 10 years ago this week, loops in the background. In this moment, I already know that whatever is represented by this woman, this symbol, I love wholeheartedly. I know that she is the living embodiment of some ideal type that informs who I am. What I don’t yet know is that who I am is gay – and that my gayness will become inextricably intertwined over the course of my life with Gaga. She will become the background music in every gay club I will dance in, the overture to every drunken kiss, a talking point for every first date.Female pop icons have long formed a core part of gay culture, and much has been written about why. Some say we live vicariously through their sexuality more Freudian theories suggest they’re our surrogate mothers. Less controversially, one could simply say their bright pop ballads about overcoming love and loss have historically provided a light-hearted, strobe-lit, glittery escapism from a world darkened by the shadows of HIV and homophobia. Before Gaga there was Madonna, Cher, Diana Ross. You may think Gaga didn’t do anything over and above what these performers did: provide glamour and camp value. But the special place she carved in the hearts of gay people cannot be reduced to her penchant for changing wigs – Lady Gaga queered the mainstream.She emerged into a pop landscape staggeringly different to the one we inhabit in 2018. The pre-Gaga charts of 2007 were socially and politically sterile, thronged with such hetero banalities as Kaiser Chiefs and Timbaland. The closest we got to queer representation was the tasteless gay-baiting of Katy Perry’s I Kissed a Girl in 2008. We were at the zenith of an economic boom, unaware of the impending global economic catastrophe that would spark a period of political revolution to coincide with Gaga’s rise. Economic comfort meant that oppression was felt less keenly, that discourse was relaxed. For kids like me stagnating in small towns, in countries where gay marriage was still illegal and casual homophobia rife, the silence felt like the calm before the storm.Some would have disregarded the reactionary content of noughties charts and simply looked back to David Bowie, Prince and Boy George for revolutionary queer role models instead – they destabilised gender categories a decade before Gaga was born. But to my generation, these icons and their reassuring androgyny were out of reach. My childhood was an alienating cultural wasteland, where I survived on a diet of my parents’ Irish country music and my peers’ Top 40 pop. This was still the age of dial-up modems – for many pre-smartphone era queer kids, the likes of Bowie may as well not have existed.Consequently, Lady Gaga turned my world upside down. I suffered from chronic anxiety, linked to years of bullying. I was offensively effeminate and school was an ordeal spent avoiding older boys who spat “faggot” at me in the corridors. After Gaga exploded, I fashioned my own diamond-encrusted glasses and dyed my hair green – the slurs in the corridors lost their power when, like Gaga, I was deliberately provoking the attention. “What a freak,” my peers would scream at pictures of Gaga’s meat dress. I burned with defiance to hear them deride her – if she was a freak, this person I loved, then I didn’t want to be normal any more. The word “faggot” resounding in the corridor no longer marked me out as lesser, but placed me on a pedestal alongside my heroine, another freak – who happened to be No 1 in 20 countries. Her otherness made my own otherness feel more aspirational than painful. In a world of utter darkness, her presence was my only light, a wordless pathway to myself before I even knew what the word queer meant.Gaga did for my generation what Bowie did 20 years earlier. She re-queered a mainstream that had fallen back into heteronormative mundanity. She vocally defended the rights of LGBT people and spoke of her own bisexuality openly. In pop, she expanded what was palatable. She repopularised the flamboyant theatricality of outrageous costuming, on-stage bleeding and compulsive wig changes. She drew inspiration from Bowie’s lightning bolts, Alexander McQueen’s fashion, Leigh Bowery’s performance art, Prince’s androgyny. She performed in male drag, and forced us to question gender characteristics and human physicality with facial protrusions and prosthetic penises. She was the vanguard for a revival of queerness in pop culture that has left an astonishing legacy a decade later – one would hardly bat an eyelid now to hear a word such as “transgender” uttered in a chart-topping song, but before Born This Way the thought would have been startling. It is partly thanks to her that we now live in an era where RuPaul’s Drag Race is mainstream.In fact, Drag Race is perhaps the key to understanding what Gaga did for young queer people. When Gaga appeared as a host on the ninth series of the show, she entered posing as one of the contestants. It’s not insignificant that Gaga presented herself as a drag queen – that’s precisely what she has always been, and what she taught young queer people like me to be.Drag is about borrowing cultural references to construct a persona. When Gaga reinvented the revolutionary queer spirit of Bowie and Prince for the youth of the noughties, she was performing a drag of her own. She borrowed tropes to construct the persona that accrued her fame, figuratively lip-syncing along to the legacies of Cher, Madonna, and the stars she imitated. She invented Gaga in the same way that drag queens do their alter egos.Millions of young gay people in turn used her example to construct their own identities in small, alienating towns and villages around the world. Every person needs references to inform their social performance, to do a sort of drag in their daily lives. Gaga offered queer people those references that our heteronormative hometowns couldn’t, reaching back into the past and passing them forward to those of us who could not access them alone. She taught a new generation of young queer people how to drag up an identity out of a barrenness around them, by looking to history and pop culture. This is what gay people have always done – but many of my generation didn’t know how. Mine was a generation whose would-be mentors had been decimated by the HIV epidemic, causing a wealth of generational community knowledge to be lost forever a generation where cohesion in the real-world gay community was breaking down and gay spaces were closing.Gaga replaced my would-be mentors. When I mimicked her outrageous presentation, I was tapping into the references she offered to express a queerness that I was not yet able to put into words. Without her in the charts, many queer kids like me would have been left with no touchstones whatsoever. She taught us all to be drag queens in our own lives – as RuPaul says, “We’re all born naked, the rest is drag”. When Gaga came to host Drag Race 9, she was truly coming home. Her importance was summarised with beautiful simplicity when one of the contestants, Eureka, broke down, saying “you don’t realise what you do for people like us”.Ten years on, Gaga’s legacy is a changed world. For me, and many gay people around the globe, she is the icon of our generation, to whom we owe nothing less than our identities. Baby, there’s no other superstar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439aaed3821edd62fabc9880f008137b8cd4a4ad/0_212_2499_1500/master/2499.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1153535041e4da2e457ace84ed71f920 1240w","title":"bryan ferry review st davids hall cardiff","story":"St David’s Hall, CardiffThe Roxy Music frontman’s crooning numbers can be sophisticated – and also dull. It’s when he gets slinky that his tour’s opening night comes aliveAs sons of County Durham farm labourers turned lounge lizards go, Bryan Ferry has long been party to the same old scenes. At the opening night of his new solo tour, his grown-up, dressed-up fans rush to the front for the disco segment of his set, silver hair glinting in the stage lights as they film their idol on their cameraphones. But before the Monday night knees-up, this gig is far more restrained, the 72-year-old Ferry spending time at his piano stool, blowing kisses to the upper tiers.This persona fits Ferry’s enduring image. Even though his band, Roxy Music, daringly soldered together experimental sounds and pop excess, Ferry is considered a tasteful sort thanks to his smooth 80s crooner incarnation. His band tonight fit this mould, offering stylish musical support in black stagewear: nimble-fingered punk guitarist Chris Spedding, noirish viola player Marina Moore and saxophonist Jorja Chalmers are particularly impressive, the latter slinking around under a precision-fringed bob straight from a 70s Roxy single sleeve. Ferry’s song choices early in the set are darkly sophisticated, too, several pulled from the cover version albums that flood his back catalogue. His take on 1930s musical standard Where Or When is particularly good, new depths being added to the lyrics by his ageing, wavering vocals. “Some things that happen for the first time,” he croaks touchingly, “seem to be happening again”.Proceedings plod after a while, though, and there is a palpable tension in the room. It’s alleviated by an energetic romp through Re-MakeRe-Model from Roxy Music’s recently reissued debut album, and a slowed-down torch-song take on 1982’s More Than This (reanimated on the 2003 Lost in Translation soundtrack). Still, the show only really roars into life with the opening saxophone blasts of Love Is the Drug, five songs from the curtain call. Hereon in, the gig is glorious: Virginia Plain, Let’s Stick Together and Editions of You all sounding fantastic as the crowd finally exhale. Ferry comes to life, too, all loose-limbed and parading. If only these slinky sirens had wailed a little earlier, and a little louder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1354e6722e5d64f06234e94fc5455a27a8a842f7/0_0_6211_3727/master/6211.jpg?w=6000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1107848ad701d780d22d762227155593 12000w","title":"commonwealth uk brexit leaving eu","story":"As director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, I know what this institution does – and the notion that it can pick up the slack when the UK leaves the EU is nonsense. By  Philip Murphy‘So, Professor Murphy,” said the voice at the end of the line. “What does the Commonwealth mean to you?” It was 2014, and I had agreed to do a live interview about the Commonwealth for a radio talk show. Media interest had been sparked by the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, and while I waited, phone in hand, for my turn to speak, the presenter was busily soliciting Commonwealth-related thoughts from anyone he could find on Glasgow’s streets that morning.Finally, just as the clock was ticking towards the very end of the show, the presenter turned his attentions to me. But I was stumped by the question. What does the Commonwealth mean to me? It was only since I had become director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies (ICwS) a few years earlier that it had “meant” anything much at all. And what was that meaning? Lots of drinks receptions in the hollowed-out citadels of Britain’s former imperial power? Endless well-meaning conferences exploring how the Commonwealth could achieve its “true potential”?In the three-and-a-half seconds while all this was racing through my head, the presenter correctly anticipated that a cheery anecdote would not be forthcoming, and moved on to the more concrete question: “What does the Commonwealth actually do?” I blurted out something spectacularly feeble along the lines of: “Well, it doesn’t do very much, but then it doesn’t cost very much.” And that was it – straight into the 10 o’clock news and traffic roundup. Not my finest hour.With the Commonwealth Games taking place at the moment and the biennial Commonwealth heads of government meeting opening in London next week, my institute will again be fielding a high volume of press enquiries. And this time, I’ll be ready for the “What does it mean to you?” question. Back in 2014, I wasn’t. But it was a variant of another question that I had regularly been asked in the five years since I became director of the ICwS: “How did you become interested in the Commonwealth?” There was always an assumption that some element of my upbringing or family history must have sparked my interest in this unique organisation, one that is very largely made up of former parts of the British empire. It currently has 53 members, including Britain itself, which range in size from India, with a population of more than 1.3 billion people, to the tiny Pacific island states of Tuvalu and Nauru, with populations of about 11,000 and 13,000 respectively. But there was nothing I could really point to. I grew up in Hull. Very occasionally we did go overseas on family holidays – but only to the Isle of Man. I can’t remember anyone even mentioning Commonwealth Day while I was at school in the 1970s and 80s. Had they been fee-paying public schools, where a good smattering of the families would probably have had records of imperial service, the situation might have been different. But they most decidedly were not.Later, as a postgraduate student studying how the Conservative party reacted to the decolonisation of Africa, I became familiar with the idea of the Commonwealth as a great, soothing comfort blanket for the party’s dwindling band of post-second world war imperial enthusiasts. They could reassure themselves that the sad business of granting independence to British colonies wasn’t really the end of the line. Like the souls of the faithful departed, these countries would simply join the heavenly throng of the Commonwealth and live in eternal peace and harmony.For the next 20 years or so, insofar as I thought about the Commonwealth, it was largely as a relatively minor aspect of British foreign policy. During the postwar period, the organisation had moved from being seen as an essential prop of Britain’s “great power” status to representing a puzzle, then an irritant, and finally a constant source of disappointment. It has maintained a loyal band of supporters, mostly concentrated in a series of London-based affiliated organisations. Yet even they often seem unable to provide any very convincing reasons for their enthusiasm.Suddenly, people started to talk about the Commonwealth again. The trouble was that most of what they were saying was nonsense.In the weeks after Britain voted for Brexit, as I tried to come to terms with what seemed to me an unmitigated disaster, there were always sympathetic friends on hand to make matters worse. “You’re at the centre of things now,” they said. “You must be very busy. Apparently the Commonwealth is the way of the future.” To which, as the director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, my response was: “If the Commonwealth is the future, then we’re in even more trouble than I thought.”Despite the leave campaign’s best efforts to turn the Commonwealth into a symbol of Britain’s ability to stand on the international stage independently of the EU, its power and influence has long been on the wane. Just a year before the Brexit referendum, the party manifestos for the UK general election reflected the Commonwealth’s diminished importance. In place of Labour’s 1997 vow to give renewed priority to this “unique network of contacts linked by history, language and legal systems”, the party now barely mentioned it. The Conservatives were a little more forthcoming, although they largely cut and pasted the words from their 2010 document. Ukip, predictably, scattered in references far more frequently than anyone else. Yet even they had dropped a startlingly ambitious proposal that had featured in its 2010 manifesto, to establish “a Commonwealth Free Trade Area” with the other Commonwealth countries.So, how exactly did it manage to shuffle its way back into the political conversation? For the leave campaign, depicting the Commonwealth as a huge potential trading opportunity for the UK was a useful fiction. This was reassuring mood music for a campaign keen to demonstrate that Britain would not be left helpless and isolated after Brexit. Yet beyond a few hand-me-down figures about its supposed economic potential, there were few clues about how or why the volume of trade with Commonwealth member states would be increased.Although the Commonwealth featured as an element in the snake oil sold to voters by the leave campaign, it was by no means the most potent ingredient. Indeed, many Brexiters struggled with the whole concept of the Commonwealth. On the one hand, it fed into their arguments that Britain had the opportunity to engage more actively with growing economies outside the EU. But it also sat uneasily within a campaign that had focused sharply on the issue of immigration.Once the result was announced, some of Britain’s most prominent Commonwealth enthusiasts began celebrating. Less than a week after the vote, the Daily Telegraph carried an article by David Howell, then chairman of the Royal Commonwealth Society, under the headline “A bright future awaits Britain post-Brexit in the Commonwealth markets”. It rehearsed a series of arguments that had been regularly trotted out for two decades, including the idea of a “Commonwealth advantage” in terms of the ease and cost of trade, and the notion that the world’s future growth areas would be outside the EU: “It is to Asia, Africa and Latin America we need to look for the big prizes, and the Commonwealth network is the gateway to many of these fast-growing new economies,” Lord Howell wrote.Given the ever more certain prospect that we will, indeed, leave the EU, it is worth looking closely at whether there is anything to this view. The origins of Howell’s argument go back to a brief and not very well-substantiated 1994 article by the Australian scholar Katherine West, titled “Britain, the Commonwealth and the Global Economy”, which was published in the the Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs. The piece began with the proposition that, for the UK, Europe had “become an economic black spot, with double-digit unemployment and the lowest rates of growth in the developed world”. It suggested that the British government’s “Eurocentric political rhetoric” tended to disguise the importance to Britain of markets outside the EU. West then moved to note “the spectacular economic growth” of Asian markets, suggesting again that “myopic concentration” on Europe on the part of British policymakers was an impediment to the exploitation of these markets.Tony Blair’s New Labour government, which took office in May 1997, initially seemed keen to run with this idea. The UK was about to host a Commonwealth heads of government meeting for the first time in 20 years, and the idea of the Commonwealth as an instrument to promote British trade seemed a useful way of fitting this rather creaking institution into New Labour’s modernising agenda.This new commercially minded love affair between the Blair government and the Commonwealth was, however, fairly shortlived. In the short term, Blair himself seemed disillusioned from virtually his first sight of the Commonwealth in action, irritated by the drawn-out and inconclusive nature of the Edinburgh Commonwealth heads of government meeting. In the longer term, and particularly after 911, Blair’s attentions focused on Anglo-American relations and the Middle East.Nevertheless, it was clear that promoting the notion of the Commonwealth as an under-utilised business asset was a way of persuading the British government to take it seriously. During the next two decades, bodies such as the Royal Commonwealth Society, the Commonwealth Business Council and the Commonwealth Secretariat pushed the idea vigorously. In particular, they suggested that there was a “Commonwealth effect” that rendered intra-Commonwealth trade cheaper and easier – an idea that can be traced directly to West’s 1994 article.These figures are now regularly rehearsed at Commonwealth gatherings, but there has been little objective analysis of this report, and we might well be cautious in reading too much into them. First, as the study notes, there are wide variations in the extent to which inidual Commonwealth countries trade with others. For some, the proportion is relatively low. The UK and Canada are mentioned in this context as countries “positioned close to large non-Commonwealth markets”. By contrast, there are other member states, including Singapore and Malaysia, that enjoy greater geographical proximity to major Commonwealth trading partners, and so conduct a much higher proportion of intra-Commonwealth trade. Given this, and the fact that there are huge variations in the levels of trade conducted by inidual member states, it is difficult to see what we can actually learn from an average figure for “Commonwealth advantage” between two notional Commonwealth states.It is worth noting, too, that in the run-up to the referendum, Commonwealth member states were virtually as one in wishing Britain to remain part of the EU. Behind this uncharacteristic outbreak of unanimity is the simple fact that Brexit throws the UK’s future trading relationships into confusion. The working assumption is that the current EU agreements, which allow many developing Commonwealth countries access to the UK market on advantageous terms, will lapse in Britain at the moment that Brexit takes effect. It will only be after that point that the UK has the legal capacity to negotiate trade agreements independently of the EU.This means many less-developed Commonwealth countries that currently conduct a significant proportion of their trade with the UK risk being hit by an immediate tariff hike. Given the finite resources available to the UK government for complex trade negotiations, and that attention is likely to be focused on the more lucrative markets of Europe, Asia and North America, Commonwealth countries quite reasonably fear that they will be a relatively low priority for Brexit Britain. The UK is also a major contributor to the EU aid budget, from which many Commonwealth countries benefit, and British overseas dependencies face the prospect of losing access to this important source of development funding altogether.In October 2010, Michael Ancram – then the former Conservative shadow foreign secretary – published a pamphlet setting out a new agenda for British foreign policy. The document, titled Farewell to Drift: A New Foreign Policy for a Network World, showed the influence of David Howell’s worldview: the forces of globalisation were steadily undermining the significance of old-fashioned power blocs such as the EU. Conversely, the Commonwealth, with its lack of treaty or constitution and its emphasis on collaboration and mutual support, was “a readymade vehicle for positive action”.“For too long the Commonwealth has been under-funded and underappreciated by many of its members, including the UK,” Ancram wrote. “For us it costs only 20p per person per year, while the EU costs £52 per person per year. It urgently needs, with British help, encouragement and involvement to become a bolder organisation that recognises its own strengths. It could have associate members as well as new members indeed some of the giants of the world like Japan could become interested, especially if it is based in the emerging powerhouse of India. It is in our interest to encourage such countries to become involved in the Commonwealth in one way or another.”During the 2016 referendum campaign, Ancram duly pinned his colours firmly to the leave mast. His encomium nicely encapsulated many elements of the British myth of the Commonwealth. This includes the tension between wishing to use the organisation more effectively, and disavowing any wish to lead it. Ancram was not the first Commonwealth enthusiast to recommend moving its headquarters to India, the most populous member state – but, more than seven years since the publication of his pamphlet, that prospect is no less remote. With many members of India’s policymaking elite seeing the Commonwealth as little more than a quaint relic of British imperialism, there is little chance of them offering it this sort of flag of convenience. There was also something familiar in Ancram’s ambiguous contrast between the supposed 20p cost of the Commonwealth, against the EU’s £52. Were we supposed to conclude that the Commonwealth is better value for money, or simply that it is under-resourced?Commonwealth enthusiasts generally want to have it both ways: the Commonwealth has supposedly vast potential (thus the idea of Japan joining as an associate member), which could be augmented further with a little additional funding, yet membership will always remain cheaper than the EU, and not only in terms of the UK’s direct financial contribution. Somehow, this mythical Commonwealth of the future will cost less than the EU in terms of the vast number of hours required to negotiate its treaties and other formal agreements it will not require members to make significant concessions in return for some collective good and it will have only the most rudimentary of mechanisms to enforce its will.In this light, the Commonwealth is the international relations equivalent of a homeopathic remedy – a cadre of staff so small as to be almost invisible when dissolved across a body comprising 2.4 billion people, which nevertheless does or could achieve miraculous results. But the promise of the Commonwealth can be seen in another, arguably far more realistic way. It is based on the prospect offered by charlatans and quacks throughout the ages – that of something for nothing.In the decades since the second world war, the process of devising and agreeing mechanisms for European cooperation has indeed been time-consuming and expensive. But it has resulted in a series of concrete achievements, above all the creation of the world’s largest free-trading bloc. Decisions made at an EU level affect the texture of daily life in its member states in the way that the Commonwealth’s empty pronouncements do not. As a result, any contemporary survey of international relations since 1945 is likely to devote considerable space to the EU and little or none to the Commonwealth. Frankly, the EU matters, in a way that the Commonwealth does not.This has long been apparent to those within the UK government who engage directly with the Commonwealth. It is far less obvious, however, to the vast majority of people in the UK, who know the organisation largely through occasional high-profile events such as the Commonwealth Games, and through the annual round-robin delivered in the Queen’s speech. It is at this level, and in this specifically British context, that the myth of the Commonwealth is arguably most dangerous. It encourages perceptions of the organisation as some sort of genuine global network with the UK at its centre, the other members ready to fall into line and embrace the prodigal mother whenever Britain finally decides that it is time to resume a guiding role.It was this combination of a widespread unfamiliarity with how the modern Commonwealth actually functions, and a lingering sense that it is in some way a special asset to the UK, that allowed some in the leave camp to present it during the 2016 referendum campaign as a direct alternative to the EU. This was despite the fact that the vast majority of Commonwealth members, and indeed the secretary general, Patricia Scotland, emphasised that membership of both organisations was not only wholly compatible but also mutually beneficial. The referendum result marked the point when the Commonwealth ceased to be simply a puzzle in Whitehall – an itch the civil service didn’t quite know how or where to scratch – and became a contributory factor in, arguably, Britain’s greatest foreign policy disaster since the end of the second world war.What, then, should be the basis of the UK’s future relationship with the Commonwealth? It could be argued that the referendum result has already ordained that this relationship will be an ever-closer one. But I doubt that. Brexit is unlikely to enhance British trade with Commonwealth countries. Indeed, in the short term, it might actually reduce it, as the UK struggles to replicate deals already in place under its EU membership. There may be closer trading and diplomatic relations with Australia and New Zealand, which represent the acceptable face of the organisation to those leave supporters who continue to regard the citizens of the notional white Commonwealth as “kith and kin”. But when it comes to the genuinely vast potential of the Indian market, a UK government driven by the anti-immigration agenda of leave voters is unlikely to make great strides in that direction. For example, India seems likely to want a relaxation of visa restrictions on its nationals in return for trade liberalisation. Certainly, the issue of immigration overshadowed Theresa May’s visit there in November 2016, leading to accusations that the UK wanted India’s business, but not its people. And whatever the future holds, invoking the name of the Commonwealth is unlikely to oil the wheels of any trade deal.As the Commonwealth summit in London approaches, get ready to hear about the long list of good causes – from ending war and poverty to tackling climate change, and from spreading democracy to promoting gender equality – that the organisation champions. All of this is, indeed, laudable. But given the Commonwealth’s record in recent years, one would need a great deal of faith and a remarkably short memory to believe that the organisation really can make a significant contribution in any of these areas. What is surely beyond doubt is that the Commonwealth cannot rescue the UK from the grievous, self-inflicted wound of Brexit. And any suggestion that it can will only serve to rob the organisation of whatever last vestiges of credibility it still possesses.Adapted from The Empire’s New Clothes: The Myth of the Commonwealth by Philip Murphy, published by Hurst on 19 April• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34cd09783041fd7d2e0cbcb2df989c374f92ec01/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ec498cb73f2ca844fa77c99d3a25bd1f 1240w","title":"mays frictionless eu trade plan after brexit dealt blow by key ally","story":"More bureaucracy will be part of price tag for UK leaving single market, says Danish PMTheresa May’s plans for a Brexit deal that delivers frictionless trade with the EU have been dealt a blow by a key European ally who has said there will be more bureaucracy after leaving the bloc.The Danish prime minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said after talks with his UK counterpart in Copenhagen that there would be an inevitable price to pay for Britain leaving the single market.Following a bilateral meeting with May, he told reporters at a joint press conference: “We should avoid too many changes in our relations and I am totally in favour of an enhanced trade agreement between the EU and UK.The UK could sign up to all the EU’s rules and regulations, staying in the single market – which provides free movement of goods, services and people – and the customs union, in which EU members agree tariffs on external states. Freedom of movement would continue and the UK would keep paying into the Brussels pot. We would continue to have unfettered access to EU trade, but the pledge to “take back control” of laws, borders and money\u0026nbspwould not have been fulfilled. This\u0026nbspis an unlikely outcome and one that may be possible only by reversing the Brexit decision, after a second referendum or election.Britain could follow Norway, which is in the single market, is subject to freedom of movement rules and pays a fee to Brussels – but is outside the customs union. That combination would tie Britain to EU regulations but allow it to sign trade deals of its own. A “Norway-minus” deal is more likely. That would see the UK leave the single market and customs union and end free movement of people. But Britain would align its rules and regulations with Brussels, hoping this would allow a greater degree of market access. The UK would still be subject to EU rules.A comprehensive trade deal like the one handed to Canada would help British traders, as it would lower or eliminate tariffs. But there would be little on offer for the UK services industry. It is a bad outcome for financial services. Such a deal would leave Britain free to erge from EU rules and regulations but that in turn would lead to border checks and the rise of other “non-tariff barriers” to trade. It would leave Britain free to forge new trade deals with other nations. Many in Brussels see this as a likely outcome, based on Theresa May’s direction so far.Britain leaves with no trade deal, meaning that all trade is governed by World Trade Organization rules. Tariffs would be high, queues at the border long and the Irish border issue severe. In the short term, British aircraft might be unable to fly to some European destinations. The UK would quickly need to establish bilateral agreements to deal with the consequences, but the country would be free to take whatever future direction it wishes. It may need to deregulate to attract international business – a very different future and a lot of disruption.“I hope if there’s willingness … we will close a deal which will be as close to what we know now as possible. But we have to be realistic and we have to realise that there will be changes. Leaving the single market comes with a price tag and unfortunately the price tag is also a Danish price tag. “That is the reality of life. There will be more bureaucracy in future, unfortunately.”The European council president, Donald Tusk, has already told the UK that it should not expect frictionless trade outside the single market. “Friction is an inevitable side-effect of Brexit,” he said in March. Rasmussen, whose country is generally regarded as sympathetic toward the UK having also joined the EU in 1973, insisted Brussels was simply aiming to be “realistic and fair” in the negotiations. May also signalled that the government’s goal of cutting net annual immigration to below 100,000 would remain in place after Brexit. She said: “We recognise the concern that people in the UK have about this issue of net migration into the UK, which is why we set ourselves the target … and want to continue to work to ensure that we address that particular target.”Her position was in stark contrast to that of her home secretary, Amber Rudd, who repeatedly refused to confirm to the Commons home affairs committee last month that she was aiming to meet the target by the next election. The two leaders also discussed fishing rights, and May promised that Denmark, whose boats regularly fish in British waters, would get “fair and reciprocal access” after Brexit.Britain is braced for tough negotiations with Brussels after delaying the decision over who will control and have access to its territorial waters. The government is also facing calls at home from an increasingly belligerent fishing industry to restrict the number of foreign boats. May, who backed remaining in the EU, again refused to say whether she had changed her mind about Brexit when challenged by a Danish journalist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f398dba007c72a0235adea0e190a983ee8375024/0_128_5125_3077/master/5125.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d700f25e253cfa4d04de12d235eb580c 1240w","title":"labour minister barry gardiner sorry good friday agreement shibboleth","story":"Recording of party frontbencher emerges hours after apology for Good Friday agreement criticismBarry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, has been recorded saying Labour’s six tests for Brexit are “bollocks”.The tape has emerged hours after he was forced to apologise for suggesting that the Good Friday agreement was outdated, a suggestion made at the same event in Germany last month.On the recording he can be heard condemning the pledge to achieve the same benefits in any new relationship with the EU.“It’s bollocks. Always has been bollocks and it remains it …”He criticised the party strategy that Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has been putting forward for the past two years.“We know very well that we cannot have the exact same benefits. And actually it would have made sense, because it was the Tories who said they were going to secure the exact same benefits, and our position should have been precisely to say: ‘They have said they will secure the exact same benefits and we are going to hold them to that standard’, not that we think we can secure the exact same benefits as well.”The remarks will further stoke the anger in the party that arose after the Guardian reported that he had criticised the Good Friday agreement. As dignitaries gathered in Northern Ireland on Tuesday to mark the peace deal’s 20th anniversary, Gardiner said sorry for remarks that provoked protests from Labour colleagues and from politicians in the Irish Republic.“I am deeply sorry that my informal remarks in a meeting last month have led to misunderstanding,” Gardiner said.He apologised in particular for the use of the word “shibboleth”, which he acknowledged “gave the impression that I thought the Good Friday aagreement was in any way outdated or unimportant. I absolutely do not.”The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was also forced to repeat his commitment to ensuring there was no hard border. “There must be no return to a hard border between north and south, and no return to the horrors of the Troubles. All of us on both sides of the Irish Sea have a responsibility to maintain hope for the future.”Marking the anniversary, Corbyn paid tribute to the architects of the agreement, which he called “a defining moment in Irish history which allowed peace to prevail”. “It was a great achievement and I pay tribute to the work done by Tony Blair, Mo Mowlam and Paul Murphy, as well as those on all sides in Ireland, north and south, in achieving the crucial breakthrough of the peace process.”Labour insiders were furious at Gardiner’s apparent breach of the hard-won agreement that Labour policy should be to remain in a customs union with the EU, which was agreed and set out in Corbyn’s Coventry speech in February to protect the Good Friday agreement.“Barry’s remarks certainly weren’t agreed policy, and they were very unhelpful. Barry’s on the Brexit subcommittee and he was in the room when Jeremy’s Coventry speech was drafted, and that’s the policy now, ” one source said.Gardiner’s “shibboleth” comment came at the end of last month during a Q\u0026ampA session after a speech he gave at a German conference organised by European parties and trade unions. In his speech he kept strictly to the Labour party line, but afterwards suggested the agreement was being exploited by people anxious to prevent a hard border.On Monday the Guardian, which had obtained a recording of his remarks, repeatedly tried to reach Gardiner for a comment. On Tuesday morning, Gardiner restated his support for party policy. “The Good Friday agreement is a vital and essential part of the relationship between the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and has been central to the two decades of peace it has brought about,” he said.“Labour is completely committed to the agreement and opposed to any return of a hard border between north and south. We are committed to negotiating a new customs union between the UK and Ireland as part of a final Brexit settlement, which would play a key role in ensuring there is no hard border.”Shortly before the apology was released, Starmer tweeted: “Labour fully supports the Good Friday agreement in all its aspects, including no hard border. Crucial this is fully respected in the Brexit negotiations and beyond.”Starmer intends to try to amend the Brexit legislation to ensure no hard border can be created.Days after Gardiner’s remarks in March, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Owen Smith, was sacked from Labour’s frontbench for writing an article in the Guardian that supported a second referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal. Smith described Gardiner’s remarks as “reckless and plain wrong”.“On the Good Friday Agreement’s 20th anniversary, Labour should be defending and sustaining it, not joining the Tory Brexiteers in downplaying its importance and the risks of a hard border,” Smith wrote in a tweet.The former Labour prime minister Tony Blair said he could not believe what Gardiner had said.A Fine Gael Brexit spokesman, senator Neale Richmond, said he expected remarks such as Gardiner’s to come from “militant extremists”, not members of the Labour party."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/026a15d1067b0350757d031ab900947b0831c4b8/0_323_4839_2903/master/4839.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1f79599ff1df2c18f4eccfc6345501b3 1240w","title":"tony blair new leadership strong progressive centre labour conservative party","story":"Ex-PM says centrism has been abandoned by Labour and Tories but denies trying to form rival partyTony Blair has called for new political leadership from the “strong progressive centre” and confirmed his institute is developing a raft of policies to encourage such leaders.The former prime minister insisted he had not given up on Labour despite his concerns of it being “in the grip of the hard left”.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he admitted he was trying re-energise the centre ground of British politics, which he claimed was being abandoned by the two main parties. “If you leave between the Brexit-dominated Tory party and a hard-left Labour party vast uncultivated centre ground, at some point someone is going to come along and cultivate it,” he said.At the weekend the Observer revealed that plans for a new centrist party had attracted £50m of investment. Blair denied trying to form a new party, saying: “I’m not advocating it or involved in such a one or certainly not running for its leadership at this or any stage.”But he said such a plan should not be derided by the established parties. “What is most sensible is for both of the main parties to realise they can pour scorn on people who are thinking of these things, but ultimately they’ve got to understand there is a constituency in this country which is socially liberal, in favour of strong methods of social justice, but also believes in a well-run enterprising economy.”Blair lamented the lack of political leadership from centrists. He said: “The really depressing thing about western politics at the moment is that the leadership of what I would call a strong progressive centre is just not there, it is lacking. “And the result of it is you have rightwing politics going into anti-immigration nationalism and leftwing politics going into sort of anti-business old form of statism, and neither are the answer to the problem of the future.”He confirmed that his Tony Blair Institute for Global Change was developing a platform for any emerging centrist politicians to utilise. “What we are is putting together is a policy platform … that anyone in politics could take if they come from the open-minded approach to the problem, which says that globalisation is essentially a good thing, not a bad thing, but its risks have to be mitigated … My institute is looking at things like housing, infrastructure, what’s the right tax and spending policy. “It is not a manifesto because it is not for a political party – it is for people whether they are in the Labour party, Conservative party, Liberal Democrats, wherever, who can see the way politics is developing in the is country and who think there must be a better set of policy ideas for the future.”He added: “I have got no infrastructure for building some political party. But what I fully own up to is trying to create the sort of centrist policies that I think can rekindle optimism about the future, since I think that these lurches to the right and to the left are basically the politics of pessimism.“Starting a new political party is incredibly difficult. I’m focused on one thing, which is what are the right ideas.”“We have got an old-fashioned Conservative party and a Labour party that’s got frankly reheated politics from the days I remember when I was a student. I don’t think either of those things answer the challenge for the country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a374eb2acb82c8588e2b633808876742c3c97925/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3a76cbc4caa95ce106b60b709831abac 1240w","title":"english language british american book","story":"Many ‘American’ phrases are actually British but a new book argues why we say what we say reveals a lot about our culturesTo those dedicated warriors hunched over their keyboards or gripping tightly to their pens, ready to fire off an angry salvo about the Americanization of British English to their favorite newspaper, television channel or book publisher, linguist Lynne Murphy has a solemn warning: check a good dictionary first.Or consider her new book, The Prodigal Tongue: The Love-Hate Relationship Between American and British English, which assaults the British obsession of attacking US English with cold, hard facts. “There is a tendency in Britain to see linguistic things you don’t like as American,” Murphy told the Guardian. But Murphy, an American who moved to the UK in 2000, demonstrates repeatedly in her book that both countries’ citizens aren’t very good at knowing which words began in which country. For instance, while shambles may have been a British invention, Murphy says it was Americans who first used it to mean “a scene of disorder or devastation”. (It was, however, a British television writer who invented omnishambles).Her book delves past simply clarifying what Americans call a courgette to explain why the two Englishes aren’t more different, how prudishness changes our experiences at the doctor’s office and what makes grammar classes a political issue in one country but not the other.It is not just the British who are taken to task, Murphy challenges her birth country’s habit of fawning over silly British words (which are sometimes American, see: poppycock) or treating the people who speak those words as more intelligent and refined just because of how their voices sound. “Nowadays, pride in American English seems to have gone the same way as our pride in being a monarchy-free republic,” Murphy writes. “The American public enthusiastically consumes news about every British royal birth, wedding or death and fetishizes the u in colour as if it hadn’t deserved the drubbing our ancestors gave it.” These language explorations aren’t just about proving people wrong, Murphy insists. Knowing the stories behind our languages helps us better understand ourselves. She pointed to how people from the two countries say please and thank you at inverse rates: with the British saying please more and Americans saying thank you more. “That tells us a story about British politeness culture being more deferent to saying please and American politeness culture being more interested in not showing deference but showing appreciation,” Murphy said. “Because we do tend to assume ‘the way I say things are just the way things get said’, but we say things for particular reasons and you learn a lot about yourself that way.”Before arriving in the UK, Murphy had worked in South Africa and was already well-versed in the familiar differences between Englishes, such as liftelevator and biscuitcookie. It was the lesser-known linguistic differences, such as how Americans think a frown is something you do with your mouth and the British think is something you do with your eyebrows, that inspired her in 2006 to start a blog: Separated by a Common Language. Blog entries, like the book, explore things such as the differences between American and British overstatement and why one country says arse and the other says ass. And though Murphy is married to a Londoner and has lived in the UK for nearly 20 years, she has yet to identify all the linguistic differences between the two languages. The University of Sussex linguistics professor said she still leaves administrative meetings at work with notes on phrasings unusual to her American-born ears, such as “not worth the candle”, which means worthless. “I learn new things all the time,” she said.Lynne Murphy’s The Prodigal Tongue: The Love-Hate Relationship Between American and British English is published by Penguin Books in the US and Oneworld in the UKThese words came into English after 1776. Do you know whether they are American, British or neither?

Money talks in Augusta, same as anywhere, but Augusta does not like to talk money. Certainly they are made in Cincinnati by the Hamilton Tailoring Co, from tropical wool, pantone 342, three buttons, double‑breasted, with the owner’s name stitched on the inside. And there is nothing, certainly not in the game of golf, that Rory McIlroy wants more. This was McIlroy’s fourth run at finishing the career grand slam and the most painful to watch of the lot because it was his best chance yet.McIlroy was right where he wanted to be on Sunday, in the final group, and, though he was three shots off Patrick Reed at the start, that at least meant he could freewheel as he did not have a lead to hang on to. “I’ve been waiting for this chance,” he said on Saturday night, and a long time, too. This was his first time in the final pair since 2011, when he blew up on the 10th. “That was a huge turning point in my career. It was the day that I realised I wasn’t ready to win major championships and I needed to reflect on that and realise what I needed to do differently.”That round haunted McIlroy. And, if there is a lesson there for him to use this time, it is that he has to make sure this one does not do so, too. They say the Masters starts on the back nine on Sunday but McIlroy was so flat that this one was all over by then. Jordan Spieth was so far back that even his final-round 64 did not really worry Reed. “When he birdied the 12th and 13th, I knew I had those holes coming up,” Reed said of Spieth, “and as long as I could keep it at least tied with him, he would run out of holes and I would have more birdie opportunities coming in.”So Reed felt he always had Spieth covered. It was the\u0026nbspsame with Rickie Fowler when he made a birdie on the 18th to go to 14 under. Reed knew all he had to do was get through the last two holes in even par. Which is not to say it was easy. He still had to get up and down on the 17th and then face that wicked downhill putt on the 18th\u0026nbspgreen. “But I kept reminding myself, and my caddie\u0026nbspkept reminding me: ‘Just go do you. Go play golf.’\u0026nbspAnd I was able to get through it mentally.” Reed found a way to cope.McIlroy did not. It was telling that he did not even figure in Reed’s conversation about what was going through his mind as he came round the back nine. Their business was already settled. It had been a scrap on the early holes. Both were nervous on the 1st, where Reed hit his opening tee-shot into a tree, and McIlroy pushed his wide right into the pine straw. They both ended up in the front left bunker by the green. McIlroy made much the better recovery and Reed dropped a shot. And when McIlroy uncorked a pinpoint approach on the 2nd, he looked the likely winner.Then McIlroy missed his eagle putt. Which is the first of a few what-ifs he will be left with. But still he made his birdie, which meant the gap between them was down to one and the pressure was all on Reed, just as McIlroy predicted it would be on Saturday night. But at the 3rd everything shifted when McIlroy missed a 10ft putt for par and Reed made one for birdie from half as far again. McIlroy made another birdie on the 4th but gave it away again when he missed a 5ft putt for par on the 5th. That was the end of it.“Every time I took a step forward I took a step back on\u0026nbspthe next hole,” McIlroy said. He added that he was going to “sit down and reflect over the next few days” to try to figure out what had gone wrong, “whether it be mindset or, I don’t know, if I just didn’t quite have it\u0026nbsptoday”.But Reed had a pretty clear idea of what happened. The pressure got to him. “That’s the biggest thing is going into a Sunday, especially for me trying to win my first and for him, trying to win the career grand slam. It’s who is going to handle the pressure and who is going to have more pressure on them.”Reed believes that the reason McIlroy’s golf was so much worse than it had been on Saturday, when he shot 65, was because he was that much closer to winning that Green Jacket and finishing the grand slam. Hell, McIlroy could not even bring himself to say the phrase on Saturday night. “We’ll obviously still be feeling it,” he said when he was asked about the pressure, “It’s the last round of a major championship, and we’re both going for – Patrick is going for his first and I’m going for” – there was a beat here while he held the words in his throat – “something else.”McIlroy did not sound like a man who was all that comfortable with the position he was in, even though he has clearly learned to feel comfortable with the course. He has finished in the top 10 at the Masters five years in a row. So he has the game to win here. But then, so did a lot of good golfers who never did. Men such as Ernie Els. After this, for sure, the young US golfers McIlroy is competing against will not be intimidated the next time they play him on a Sunday here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17914da0e914b2fe2fe509bc1f5b7f53b286cfb1/0_675_2400_1439/master/2400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d5533bbd28206c95f5758ff03aa8ad73 1240w","title":"talking horses katie walsh women jockeys grand national 2018 baie des iles horse racing tips","story":"Tony Paley: Katie Walsh, who is aiming to be the first female rider to win the Grand National, is not worried about ground conditions at Aintree for her mount Baie Des Iles’ challenge on Saturday.The seven-year-old runner was third in the Grand National Trial at Punchestown on heavy ground but her rider does not think deep ground is a necessity.Walsh, who finished third in the 2012 National on Seabass, said: “Baie Des Iles is really well at home and we are very much looking forward to Saturday. She did a nice piece of work towards the end of last week and everything has gone smoothly with her.“She has plenty of form on heavy ground, but she has a good action and I think better ground wouldn’t be too much of an issue either.”As well as Walsh aiming to be the first female to ride the winner, the mare is trained by her husband, Ross O’Sullivan.“We’re counting down the days now, but it’s going to be a great experience and I’m looking forward to riding in the race again and especially for Ross.“There is so much luck involved in a Grand National. It can depend on where you’ve been positioned throughout the race or whether you’re behind a horse who doesn’t jump well. There are a lot of variables involved.“Every runner has a chance of winning the Grand National – you just do not know what is going to happen. We’re really excited about Baie Des Iles and it will be great to be a part of the race again – I’m really looking forward to it. ”There are three female jockeys lined up to ride in this year’s National with Rachael Blackamore, one of a handful of women professional riders in Ireland, booked for Alpha Des Obeaux and Bryony Frost on board Milansbar.Overnight rain has accounted for two of Tuesday’s four scheduled meetings this morning, with Southwell forced to abandon its seven-race National Hunt card following a 7am inspection and Hexham following suit a few minutes ago with its track waterlogged and more rain expected. That leaves Hereford’s jumps card as the only survivor this afternoon – and if you were planning to attend Nottingham’s first Flat meeting of the new turf campaign on Wednesday, you can forget about that as well.The obvious temptation is to spend a little more time looking at Saturday’s Grand National, but there are a couple of runners worth a second look at Hereford, including Surtee Du Berlais (3.10) in what promises to be a demanding handicap hurdle for stayers.Oliver Sherwood’s mare has not run over hurdles since February 2017, but had enough talent over timber to win a Listed event at Kempton in November 2016 and earn a handicap mark of 138. Surtee Du Berlais returns to the smaller obstacles on Tuesday off 132 following a somewhat underwhelming campaign over fences, but she is a live runner at around 7-1 if she can rediscover anything close to her best hurdling form.Llantara (2.10) produced a career-best to win by 15 lengths at Towcester 12 days ago and while a couple of those that were fancied to run well were left floundering on the ground, the winner’s time was solid. She should follow up today, while Faadhel (6.45) can make the most of an opening mark of 70 on the Flat card at Wolverhampton this evening.Tips by Greg Wood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ee4e78120b90f00c445606983041832832b6918/203_243_3005_1803/master/3005.jpg?w=3000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=785b4979e52a5b3573a669487f6b660f 6000w","title":"commonwealth games day six in pictures","story":"All the latest pictures from the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast as cyclists, boxers, ers and athletes battle for medals"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8bf56a58af939f3b1237a0ef6217f425326d825/352_63_1906_1143/master/1906.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=67275b1557971c0c7551c271f4b892dd 1240w","title":"commonwealth games 2018 day six cycling time trial hockey boxing and more live","story":"Back to the track, and it’s a Botwana 1-2 in the final! Makwala went out like a train – he’s a sub-20 second runner in the 200m – and kept going around the bend to win comfortably. His team-mate Baboloki Thebe pips Jamaica’s Francis to silver. Remember there is no Kirani James here, so that made Makwala’s job a lot easier, but he will still be delighted with that medal after what happened at the World Championships last year. That caps an outstanding meet for Australia, Bronte Campbell blowing Canada’s Taylor Ruck away in the final length! Wales take the bronze! That’s five seconds off their national record! Great stuff. Canada and Australia neck and neck going into the fourth leg! Alys Thomas is having a brilliant swim for Wales, who are hanging onto third! Back to the pool now, for the final women’s swimming final: the 4 x 100m medley relay final. South Africa, Scotland, England, Australia, Canada, Wales, Isle of Man, New Zealand make up the lanes. World-record holder Kylie Masse of Canada leads the first leg, Australia half a second behind in second and Wales in third! Have a look at all the best images from day six in our gallery.Kurt Fearnley picks up his silver medal for the T54 1500m, with a huge roar going up from the home crowd as the athletes go up onto the podium. Congratulations to Canada’s Alexandre Dupont, who held Fearnley off down the home straight.“Kurt Fearnley is a legend in wheelchair racing,” emails Chris Page. “He was a constant thorn in the side of David Weir. To go into retirement with a Commonwealth Silver in such a tight race, he has to be satisfied with what he’s achieved over 18 years of racing with greats such as Weir, Heinz Frei and Marcel Hug.”Julia Ratcliffe takes it down, her score of 68.94m enough to see of Australia’s Alexandra Hulley. Australia’s Lara Nielson takes the bronze. Ratcliffe is in tears as she runs over to her coach in the crowd. Lord knows how Sophie Hitchon is feeling right now after she fouled out in the second round.Nigeria’s fourth powerlifting gold as Abdulazeez Ibrahim manages 220kg to secure a score of 191.9 points. Malaysia’s Jong Yee Khie takes the silver and India’s Sachin Chaudhary won bronze. Dan Jervis pushed Australian Jack McLoughlin all the way in the final two lengths, but couldn’t quite reach the wall for the gold. Still, that is an absolutely magnificent race from the Welshman, knocking three seconds off his personal best with a time of 14:48:67. Australia’s Mack Horton takes the bronze. Part-time painter and decorator Jervis talks to the cameras:I’ll be back in four years to win the gold. I hope, anyway. Fair play to Jack, he had a great swim. I was dying, to be fair! When you’re underwater, you can hear the roar of the crowd, there’s 10,000 people in here. It was so much fun. The main aim was to win a medal, and to make my mum and dad proud, as well as my beautiful girlfriend. The only reason I do this is to make them proud.” The rain is now lashing down at the Carrara Stadium! Absolutely bucketing it down. The first of the three semi-finals for the women’s 400m are underway. Scotland’s Zoey Clark – Britain’s No 1 in this event – can only manage fourth in the first head, with Jamaica’s Anastasia Le-Roy and Botswana’s Amantle Montsho into the final with the two automatic spots. Big shock in the women’s hammer throw final, as England Sophie Hitchon – bronze medallist at Rio 2016 and the hot favourite for gold here – has fouled three times (the last finding the left edge of the net) and is out of the final! She is absolutely furious with herself, and while there were tears at her disappointing seventh-placed finish at the World Championships last year, there are none here. She stomps off, in an understandable huff. New Zealand’s Julia Ratcliffe is currently leading with a throw of 68.60m after the second round, 40cm ahead of the Australian Alexandrea Hulley. To put that into context, Hitchon’s record throw is 74.54m. Great scenes in the athletics stadium as Madison de Rozario collects her gold medal for her T54 1500m final triumph. With eye-catching silver hair and a smile as wide as the podium, she looks absolutely buzzing as the Australian national anthem blares out around the stadium. That will taste especially sweet after the last Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, where she got a 40cm blood clot on the flight over from Australia to Scotland and ended up in hospital, unable to compete.“Scotland’s Sammi Kinghorn was in contention for bronze,” emails Chris Page. “Fourth is no disgrace in such a strong field. Thirty years of studying wheelchair racing tells me that if Sammi stays fit and continues on her current trajectory, she will be a serious prospect at Tokyo 2020.”Australia have having a silly Games in the pool aren’t they? Lakeisha Patterson absolutely decimates the field in the women’s S8 50m freestyle final, a full two seconds clear of her nearest challenger, Canada’s Morgan Bird, who takes the silver. Abigail Tripp takes the bronze, she was comfortably third. Meanwhile, it’s an Australian 1-2-3 in the men’s S9 100m backstroke final! Brendan Hall followed by Timothy Hodge and then Logan Powell. Wow! Drama in the triple jump: Jamaica’s Shanieka Ricketts has been leading for the entire event but then on her last jump, Jamaica’s Kimperly Williams lays down 14.64m – a new lifetime best to snatch the gold medal from her team-mate! Ricketts has one final opportunity but can’t better Williams, who wins the gold by 12cm. Both Jamaican’s embrace, with Williams understandably delighted. She sets off on a victory lap around the stadium, the green-and-gold flat flying high. Thea Lafond of Dominica takes bronze.Wales’s Ben Gregory wins the final event – the 1500m – but it is Lindon Victor that wins the overall decathlon with 8303 points, jogging over the finish line a few seconds after Lepage. Canada have won the last two men’s Commonwealth titles but Lepage can only manage silver although he does finish with a life-time best score of 8171, with Australia’s Dubler taking bronze, plenty of cheers from the home crowd for that one. Grenada’s Lindon Victor leads the decathlon, a surprise leader of 170, which equates to a 26-second advantage into the final event – the 1500m - over his nearest challenger, Canada’s Pierce Lepage. Surely that is enough for the gold medal. Australia’s Cedric Dubler is in third. As they set off, Victor is at the back of the field, not because he’s tiring, simply because he wants to have his rivals in front of him, where he can see them, and accelerate if necessary. That’s a shock result, and no fairytale send-off for Australia’s Kurt Fearnley in his last ever track race. Canada’s Alexandre Dupont took it out on the back straight. He went on the outside to stay on as Fearnley tried to flash home. Australia’s Jake Lappin took bronze, while England’s Richard Chiassaro faded to the back after attempting to take it out from the start. In the women’s triple jump, it’s the end of the third round, the cut-off point for four jumpers, leaving eight to have three more jumps. Thea Lafond from Dominica can’t improve on her third place despite a slight improvement to 13.92m. Shaneika Richards of Jamaica on 14.52 leads compatriot Kimberley Williams on 14.34 in the hunt for gold, which is a reversal of the pre-meet predictions. Mitch Larkin takes gold, his fourth of the games, by a fingernail from Scotland’s Duncan Scott who was flying home the final freestyle leg and has to be satisfied with his sixth medal of the meet. That was close. Clyde Lewis takes bronze for Australia. A front-running gold from Madison de Rozario, who destroyed the field. A 1-2 for Australia, in fact, with defending champ Angela Ballard getting silver. Back in bronze is Diane Roy, the veteran at 47. Back in athletics, two Jamaicans lead the way in the women’s triple jump final. Shanieka Ricketts leads the way after laying down a season’s best score of 14.52m in front of her team-mate Kimberly Williams and Thea Lafond of Dominica. John Brewin is jumping in the blog for the next 20 minutes or so. See you in a bit. Emily Seebohm beats Canada’s Kylie Masse to the gold! Ooooof, that was close! Wales’s Georgia Davies comes through to take the bronze in front of Australia’s Holly Barratt. Just 0.18secs separated the first four swimmers there. That is Australia’s 300th swimming gold medal in the Commonwealth Games.Ben Proud defends his Commonwealth Games title! He won by half a second in front of South Africa’s Bradley Tandy and Australia’s Cameron McEvoy! Medals coming thick and fast in the athletics and swimming.Ronald Levy wins! Silver for Jamaica’s Hansle Parchment and Australia’s Nicholas Hough gets a surprise bronze in the outside lane, just pipping the Cypriot Milan Trajkovic to a place on the podium! Pozzi was nowhere, he hit the first hurdle and never recovered! The men’s 110m hurdle final is just about to start. England’s Andrew Pozzi goes in lane four, with his two main rivals either side of him: Jamaica’s De’Jour Russell and Hansle Parchment, with Jamaica’s Ronald Levy in land seven. Here we go! Titmus wins the women’s 400m gold in the swimming in a time of 4:00:93, which knocks four seconds of the Commonwealth Games record! Silver for England’s Holly Hibbott and England’s Eleanor Faulker is third!We go now to the pool, for the women’s 400m final. Australia’s Ariarne Titmus is the overwhelming favourite – the 17-year-old won the women’s 800m final yesterday.It’s a clean start and Titmus has gone off quickly. England’s Holly Hibbott is second and Eleanor Faulker is third. Titmus is already two body lengths clear at the 200m mark. England have been defeated 97-79 by Canada in the men’s basketball qualifying final. Canada progress to the semi-finals. Earlier, Ali Jawad won men’s lightweight bronze, whilst Zoe Newson won bronze in the women’s lightweight final.“Ali is a contender for Celebration of The Games, cartwheeling around the stage,” emails Chris Page. “It’s all the more remarkable because he’s been dealing with Crohn’s disease since Rio. And Zoe’s power-to-weight ratio is epic considering she has dwarfism. Well done to both!”England’s Sophie Hitchon is arguably the favourite to win gold in the women’s hammer in the final later. She threw a new British record of 74.54m at Rio 2016 to win a historic bronze there, becoming the first British woman to win a medal in this event. However, she did not have a great World Championships last year, finishing seventh, so certainly has a point to prove today.

Edwards said his office had not received any reports of social media being manipulated to influence the 2017 New Zealand general election, but said Facebook seemed to have “lost control” of its platform, and showed no sense of responsibility regarding the 2.5 million New Zealand accounts it administered, or respect for New Zealand’s privacy laws.In an interview with the Guardian last month New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said she continued to operate a Facebook account, and had no additional security or protections than any other New Zealander.Ardern used Facebook messenger to inform her partner Clarke Gayford that she had been elected leader of the Labour party in August last year, and that she was pregnant. “Obviously social media in a political environment can be used for both further democratisation, but it can be used in the other direction as well,” Ardern said.“We haven’t set up any direct plans to do any investigations beyond what we are seeing in the international frame, certainly we will be keeping a close eye on that.” Edwards has no plans to independently investigate privacy breaches by Cambridge Analytica in New Zealand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa45c454b91a053b1febb4ed4568d7042bd3c282/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=03cb79910752a1c02ad8685e2b4f35b5 1240w","title":"facebook notify users data harvested cambridge analytica","story":"People who fear their information may have been used by Cambridge Analytica can go to a new help pageFacebook has started the process of notifying the approximately 87 million users whose data was harvested by the election consultancy Cambridge Analytica.Most users will see a message saying that “neither you nor your friends logged into ‘This Is Your Digital Life’”, the personality quiz that Cambridge Analytica used to gather its data.Around 87 million iniduals, including more than 1 million people in the UK, will receive a different response, saying “a friend of yours did log in”.

During a rare press conference last week, Zuckerberg was grilled by journalists over Facebook’s privacy lapses. His message was consistent: mistakes were made, he takes responsibility and the company has made sweeping changes to better protect user data.“We didn’t take a broad enough view of what our responsibility is, and that was a huge mistake. It was my mistake,” he said. While some of the questions were tough, it was merely a dress rehearsal for a much more consequential grilling in Washington DC this week. On Tuesday, Zuckerberg will testify before a joint hearing of the Senate commerce and judiciary committees over data misuse, following revelations that Cambridge Analytica acquired millions of profiles of US citizens and used it to build a software program to predict and influence voters. The next day, Zuckerberg will testify on the same topic before the House energy and commerce committee.Taking the stand will be a major test for Zuckerberg’s communication skills. Unlike when he deals with the media, his public relations team won’t be there to cherry-pick questions from friendly parties. And Congress wants its pound of flesh.Adam Hodge, a crisis communications veteran from SKDKnickerbocker, agrees. “I expect members of Congress are going to grill him intensely and if they feel like they aren’t getting straight answers they are going to lose their patience pretty quickly,” he said. Zuckerberg will want to come across as authentic and apologetic, and will, according to his testimony published on Monday, highlight the sweeping changes that the company has announced already to its privacy tools and to the way third parties can access data on the platform as well as a verification process for political advertisers and page administrators. He will probably also want to talk about Facebook’s global compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a broad set of privacy protections being introduced in the European Union in May.“He clearly has to deeply, personally apologise and hope he will satisfy and blunt any attempt at US regulation,” said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. “He does not want to see strong regulatory oversight.”Although Zuckerberg will likely continue to blame “bad actors” misusing the platform, it will be difficult to deflect questions about Facebook’s core business model of continually tracking and monetising iniduals and their relationships.“This is a long-standing problem, not a bug in the Facebook system. It’s a feature,” said Robyn Caplan, a researcher at Data \u0026amp Society, pointing out that Facebook lured third-party developers by offering them access to user data.“The main issue is not whether or not entities have inidual data but how that data is being used. How are advertisers or political campaigns using that data to come back onto the Facebook system and seed content to particular users,” she added. “We know very little about how this targeting works.”Chester agrees: “People have no idea what is operating behind the Facebook curtain. They don’t know about data mining, analytics and digital ad practices,” he said.The company is pouring money into its defence, hiring US law firm WilmerHale, led by Reginald Brown, previously a special adviser to President George W Bush, to coach Zuckerberg on the best strategies for handling the heat, according to the New York Times. At the same time Facebook is bolstering its lobbying capabilities. The company spent almost $12m on lobbying in 2017 and is currently on a “hiring spree” for policy communications specialists. In spite of this investment, Zuckerberg can’t expect an easy ride – as the bosses of other companies in industries facing public and political ire have found.One tactic policymakers might use is to fixate on tiny symbolic details that might tarnish Facebook rather than questions that go to the core of the problem. This happened in 2008 when the CEOs of Ford, Chrysler and General Motors took private jets to Washington to request taxpayer bailout money.“They came to discuss the fate of a major industry and Congress hit them on ‘why did you fly here?’” said Ratner. “He’s going to have to be prepared for that.”A few rounds of public humiliation might just be the price Zuckerberg has to pay to appease regulators, provided he is generous with his time and detailed and contrite in his responses. The only real imminent regulatory threat to his company is the Federal Trade Commission’s investigation, which could lead to huge fines.“Symbolically he’s going to be taken to the political woodshed, but will probably be let off without any serious consequences at a federal level,” said Chester."},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

This has happened and we believe we are mandated by this election to pass this law.”The Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán has used scaremongering tactics about migrants and refugees as the cornerstone of his politics in the past few years, but in classic populist style, he has also required a shadowy, nefarious overlord to target. In Orbán’s case, that figure has been George Soros, who perfectly fits the bill as both insider and outsider in Hungary.Soros was born György Schwartz to a family of Hungarian Jews in 1930, but his father changed their surname to make it more Hungarian. His family split up and lived under assumed identities to escape the Holocaust, and Soros left Hungary in 1947 to study in London. He later emigrated to the US, making billions as an investor and hedge fund manager. His Open Society foundations have donated billions to promoting civil society and human rights, particularly in the former Communist countries of central and eastern Europe.Soros is a favoured target of rightwing governments worldwide, including in Israel. Hungarian officials have used criticism of Soros by Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to deflect allegations of antisemitism around their own anti-Soros campaign.However, at times, the rhetoric appears to borrow heavily from antisemitic tropes. In a March\u0026nbspspeech\u0026nbspin which he accused the political opposition of being “Soros candidates”, Orbán referred to his enemies as “not straightforward but crafty not honest but base not national but international does not believe in working but speculates with money”.Orbán, who will now serve a third consecutive term as prime minister, portrayed himself on the campaign trail as the defender of a white, Christian Hungary at risk from refugees and migrants, and under attack from George Soros, the financier and philanthropist of Jewish-Hungarian origin. The campaign was almost exclusively focused on migration, and on Tuesday Orbán said the result of the elections vindicated this choice.“The Hungarian voters have designated the most important topics: immigration and the topic of national security. Hungarians have decided they want to be the only ones who will decide who can live in Hungary.”Orbán said the government had not yet discussed the specific issue of Soros’s Budapest-based Central European University, which announced on Monday an agreement to open a satellite campus in Vienna. The prime minister also said he planned to build on diplomatic ties with Poland and the German region of Bavaria following their direct support for his re-election.Orbán refused to comment on a sharply critical preliminary report on the Hungarian elections released on Monday by international monitors, which referred to “intimidating and xenophobic rhetoric and media bias” during the campaign.Two weeks before the vote, thousands of anti-migrant billboards appeared that were theoretically unrelated to the campaign. They featured a long line of migrants, emblazoned with the word “stop”. The same photograph was used in Ukip’s controversial “breaking point” poster during the UK’s EU referendum campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57819a445079892231521849019b83809c285d55/483_474_2294_1377/master/2294.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b71709194329ed87286499c0749adc62 1240w","title":"sri lanka opens door for return of divisive former president mahinda rajapaksa","story":"Voters who turfed Mahinda Rajapaksa out of office in 2015 give his party local election winA familiar face is back on walls across Sri Lanka. The country’s former president Mahinda Rajapaksa has been grinning from thousands of posters and billboards recently, palms pressed together in gratitude.Voters delivered a shock repudiation of Rajapaksa’s government three years ago, as the UN investigated war crimes against Tamil civilians, dissidents disappeared in unmarked white vans and warnings were issued that Sri Lankan democracy was at risk.In February, however, they gave the Buddhist nationalist leader’s new party a surprise victory in local government elections.With polls for parliament and the presidency scheduled for two years’ time, the result has reaffirmed Rajapaksa as Sri Lanka’s most popular politician, and raised hopes among his supporters – and fears in others – that he may yet return to power.The Rajapaksa-led opposition forced a no-confidence motion in parliament against the prime minister, Ranil Wickremasinghe, last week. It failed, but Wickremasinghe was criticised by several of his own ministers during the debate, widening cracks in the already fragile coalition government that turfed Rajapsaksa from office in 2015.“We are heading towards a snap election,” said Namal Rajapaksa, an MP and the former president’s son and heir apparent. “The future of the coalition government is going to be very unstable. The president and the prime minister have no other option.”Campaign ads in the run-up to the February polls were stark. “Remember when winning a rugby match was punishable by death?” asked one United National party flyer, in reference to a murder allegedly linked to the Rajapaksa family. “Remember when white vans were a symbol of terror and repression?”The resurgence of a leader with such heavy baggage is less surprising to close observers of Sri Lankan politics. “Rajapaksa never went away,” said Alan Keenan, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group. “His shadow has loomed over this government, literally from the first day.”It took an unlikely coalition to unseat Rajapaksa from the presidency in 2015. Appalled by a leader they regarded as breathtakingly corrupt and increasingly authoritarian, defectors from his own party forged an alliance with members of the opposition, campaigning on a unity platform of reviving civil society and tackling corruption.In power, however, longtime political enemies have struggled to work together, finding they are united by little more than antipathy toward the former president. “The relationship between the president and prime minister is as bad as it could be,” Keenan said.To win over minorities such as the Tamils, the current president, Maithripala Sirisena, promised to implement tough reforms, including to devolve power to regional governments, pursue the cases of those who disappeared during the Rajapaksa years, and reform the constitution to ensure no president could accrue the power of his predecessor.Commentators in Colombo agree too much of that agenda has been shirked by a government afraid of challenging Buddhist nationalist sentiment in the country, and kicking off a wave of rightwing anger that could lift Rajapaksa and his family back into office.Less lofty issues have also sapped the government’s support. The price of staples such as onions, fish and coconuts has increased steeply, while a decision to remove an uneconomical fertiliser subsidy has burned the agricultural sector, which still employs nearly one in three Sri Lankans.“Mahinda looked after us,” said Gamaga Nona, a paddy and banana farmer in Madilla, a village on Sri Lanka’s south coast. Fertiliser was eight times cheaper under the Rajapaksa government, she said, and the change has nearly halved the annual profit of her family farm. “Now the fertiliser is delayed and sometimes we never get it.”Civil society groups in Colombo acknowledge a pall has lifted since 2015. Newspapers that once laboured under official censorship, or the kind enforced by military vehicles parked outside journalists’ homes at night, now print boisterous criticism of the government. Human rights groups chased out ten years ago are re-establishing offices in the city. People are breathing more easily, said Asoka Obeyesekere, a barrister and director of the local chapter of Transparency International. “Civil society are not fearing for their lives anymore.”Namal Rajapaksa calls the allegations of corruption and violence that dogged his father “well planned, well executed propaganda”. “We are looking for a fresh start,” he said. “We will correct our mistakes and look for a broader relationship with our neighbours.”His party would seek a clean slate with western governments, he said, but added that continuing to participate in a UN security council investigation into the final months of the civil war – in which about 40,000 Tamil civilians may have been killed – would need to be “looked into more deeply”.“Any war will have casualties, we won’t deny that,” Rajapaksa said. “But at the end of the day what matters is the future.”Should opposition groups find a way to paper over their differences, and unite as they did in 2015, they may still have the numbers to keep the Rajapaksas out.“The local government results showed no other political force in the country can shine on their own,” Obeyesekere said. “Really the only way to have any strength is in unity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49cddabee9fe6ff99ea52e541c7e1d79828b5744/0_249_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f0895941cb781a1a454e9a22dbd6dd1d 1240w","title":"the afghan cop who became a german nurse and other refugee success stories","story":"German initiatives are equipping new arrivals with the skills to alleviate the country’s worker shortageIt’s breakfast time at a care home in Brandenburg and Zia Hayafi is busy. He is gently moving an elderly woman from her bed into a wheelchair. He should be hurrying – they are waiting for her in the dining room. But he takes his time, moving close to her ear to ask: “Did you sleep well?” She nods.“I like old people,” he says. “When I’m that old, I’m going to want someone nice around to look after me.”Hayafi, 20, has been working here for three months. It is about as different as can be imagined from his former life as an officer in the Afghan police force. There, the big concern was the Taliban (Hayafi, an ethnic Hazara, eventually fled). Here, the concern is whether Germany will let him stay. It should give it serious thought. Germany faces skills gaps across its economy that will only widen as the population ages. But it has also welcomed more than 1 million refugees in little more than two years. Programmes have sprung up trying to solve the former with the latter, aided by laws that look more kindly on asylum seekers working, something that is in effect forbidden in France and the UK.More than 1.2\u0026nbspmillion people sought asylum in Europe in 2016. How are they adapting to their new lives? What do they miss? What’s it like to swap Homs for Hamburg, Kabul for Croydon, or Mosul for the Mosel?​.​\u0026nbspWhich European countries are best at helping refugees settle? In this series, the Guardian teams up with Der Spiegel, Le Monde and El País to get inside newly arrived communities in western Europe to assess whether promises are being kept, whether European society is changing the new arrivals – and vice versa. But although 400,000 German companies have employed asylum seekers in one form or another, the majority have been taken on under short-term arrangements such as internships and placements, which do not always have a happy ending. According to statistics, every third trainee in Germany would have to opt for geriatric care at present to counteract the shortage of skilled workers. In fact, fewer than one in 10 do so. People like Hayafi should be a godsend. But it is not clear that he will even complete the training. His original asylum request was refused, as is increasingly common with Afghans in Europe. He could be deported at any time, but he is appealing against the decision. “I want to earn good money and buy a house,” he says. About 150 miles (240km) west, Hannah Hillebrand is having a tough time with her trainees in the kitchen. Zabi has forgotten to put sugar in the dough, Hassan is peeling hot potatoes with his bare hands and Saeed is trying to fillet a fish with the wrong knife. Hillebrand is a leader of the Refugee Canteen project in Hamburg, which gives newcomers 14 weeks of hands-on experience in its kitchen before securing them a six-week internship in a restaurant or cafe. She spent three months writing a training manual containing recipes and key facts about German cooking, but her six pupils cannot do much with it. The text is too long and the terminology is alien. She must start with the basics.But there are significant hurdles, as Hillebrand is experiencing. Aref is good at preparing potato salad, but when he is asked to get limes out of the fridge, he doesn’t move. He does not know what limes are, but he dare not admit it. “They look like green lemons,” says Hillebrand. “I’m nervous because I’m worried that I won’t understand everything,” says Saeed, who is soon to undertake his six-week placement in a restaurant. Like many others here, he had never set foot in a kitchen before he came to Germany. In Afghanistan, it was his mother who cooked. Membership Event: The New Arrivals: Is our asylum system broken?  A proper apprenticeship is a holy grail for many young asylum seekers who want to stay longer in Germany. Under the “three plus two” arrangement introduced in August 2016, they are accorded two years of leave to remain after completing three years of training. On the edge of Berlin, Basel Alsayed hands out worksheets to pupils at Am Pappelhain primary school. The sheets ask children to identify gender articles: der, die or das Blume? He doesn’t tell the pupils, but this is homework he himself was doing only weeks earlier. He hopes he won’t end up teaching the children things that are incorrect. Alsayed is enrolled in the government-funded Refugee Teachers programme of Potsdam University, in which Syrian teachers spend 18 months doing a mixture of language courses, teacher training and work experience. This year there were more applicants than the 29 places available, and the funding is currently earmarked only until March 2019. Alsayed is already proving his worth in the primary school, where one-third of pupils are originally from places such as Bosnia, Ghana, Palestine and Syria. “Basel is a firefighter – he helps wherever the need is,” says Gerald Schneider, the headteacher of Am Pappelhain. “He translates when there are language problems with parents, fills in when teachers are ill. He is scarily tough. We use him for far more than we probably should.” “I was thrown in at the deep end,” says Alsayed. He left behind Damascus, the school where he taught, his mother and other family to avoid being conscripted into the war in Syria. He headed initially for west Germany, but was resettled under a quota scheme in Zehdenick, north of Berlin.  It didn’t feel like it at the time, but this was his big break: the Potsdam scheme is not available in any other German region. Initially he was frustrated at having to study again: “Suddenly I was having to do my own homework instead of handing it out,” he says. His German is almost perfect, but now and then he mangles a declension or searches for a rare word, and when he says “p”, it sounds like “b”. Botsdam, he says.  The need for teachers like Alsayed is expected to grow. Projections indicate that in five years there will be almost 300,000 immigrant children in Germany’s schools. And the Bertelsmann Foundation forecasts a shortfall of about 35,000 primary school teachers by 2025.The potential for a solution is there: in 2016, 11,000 of the people who claimed asylum were teachers. And of course, many of them will be better able to empathise with the thousands of bewildered Syrian children in Germany’s school system. “I can’t explain to children who have come to Germany as refugees why it is that they are suddenly here,” Alsayed says. “But I think I know how they feel.”Join us for a Guardian Live event, where our panel of experts will discuss the question: is our asylum system broken?

The 59 cruise missiles launched from US warships in the Mediterranean damaged runways and hangars at al-Shayrat but they were quickly repaired. That attack was largely symbolic. If Trump orders a second strike, it will probably be more comprehensive. The US president will be keen to assert himself as a strongman if he feels his own red line has been crossed (comparisons to Obama are too much for him). France too has previously said it would be prepared to act if the use of chemical weapons is proven.Likely targets a second time round would be other Syrian airbases, and perhaps what remains of the air force itself. Whittled down and battered, the Syrian jet fleet has been heavily propped up by Russian fighters. Syria’s air defence system has been heavily damaged by Israeli attacks.The US maintains a naval battle group in the eastern Mediterranean, well stocked with over-the-horizon missiles. It has a large number of jet fighters in Qatar and on carriers in the Gulf, which are deployed to bomb Isis. The politics of flying over Iraq or Saudi Arabia to bomb the Syrian regime may prove tricky. Missiles are a more likely option. They’re harder to shoot down and it matters little if they are. Striking from the west poses fewer problems all around. French jets could hit Syrian targets after taking off from French airfields. If Britain joins the fray, it has a base on nearby Cyprus, a short hop from Syria.The RAF has a large contingent in the Middle East still engaged in action against Isis remnants and could easily ert planes and drones to Syrian military targets if required. It has Tornados posted in the region that have a reputation for flying low and precision bombing, and Typhoons armed with Paveway lV guided bombs. It also has Reaper drones equipped with Hellfire missiles. All were in action over the last few weeks in either eastern Syria or Iraq against Isis. However, the main value of the UK to any military action by the US – which is not short of firepower or expertise – would be in allowing the US to say it isn’t acting unilaterally.Though the Syrian air defence system was heavily damaged by Israeli attacks in March, it remains a threat. Its ageing missiles still fly faster than modern jets – a 45-year-old SA 5 missile brought down an Israeli F-16, prompting the Israeli counter-strikes. However, the air defence battery offers little defence to ground-hugging missiles. And more than 100 Israeli strikes had previously been launched without a plane being hit. The bigger question is whether Russia would activate its more formidable S-400 system, which has been in place in Syria for more than a year. This poses a lethal threat to the world’s most modern jets. During previous attacks, Russia has sometimes briefly turned the system on, but it has not yet used it. A warning by the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, to Trump not to attack could indicate a different approach a strike is ordered this time.What remains of the opposition is on its knees. It has no defence against air attacks and has lost most of its strongholds. Only Daraa in the south and Idlib in the north remain under its control, and the latter it shares with jihadis who have a very different view of what a postwar Syria should look like. For the past six years opposition leaders have been calling for no-fly zones or airstrikes to weaken the regime.Russian and Syrian jets have battered anti-Assad forces into submission, eastern Ghouta being the latest example of that. With Russia dominating the skies across at least two-thirds of Syria, a no-fly zone is not an option. The opposition pipe dream remains the ousting of the regime. But with that not a consideration for even Assad’s foes these days, the best the opposition can hope for is a weakened Syrian air force.Additional reporting by Ewen MacAskill"},{"url":null,"title":"dit-s-new-campus-at-grangegorman-takes-shape-1.3453048","story":"  April 7, 2018The biggest higher-education development in the State\u0026rsquos history will transform Dublin\u0026rsquos north-inner city.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe British and Irish governments have been urged to devote greater energy to resolving the impasse in Northern Ireland by former taoiseach Bertie Ahern and former British prime minister Tony Blair, architects of the Belfast Agreement signed 20 years ago today.Both men said difficulties in resuscitating the power-sharing institutions could be overcome with more effort and focus, in separate interviews with The Irish Times to mark the agreement’s anniversary.Meanwhile, speaking at University College Dublin, former US president Bill Clinton warned that the present “paralysis” in the power-sharing institutions had a limit and could not go on indefinitely without endangering the settlement. He appealed to politicians in the North to “compromise” to find a way forward.Mr Ahern said: “If the two governments at top level give it total commitment I believe a deal can be done quickly.“I don’t see any reason why it can’t be done between now and the end of May if the will is there.”Mr Ahern said all the main political players in Dublin, London and Belfast were relatively new to their jobs, but that this meant that “Leo Varadkar and Theresa May have to get stuck in and work very hard to bring it all together”.“I know they have other big issues to deal with, notably Brexit, but that is not an excuse for not devoting all the time and energy required to the North,” Mr Ahern said.Echoing Mr Ahern’s views, Mr Blair said that difficulties between the Northern parties could be resolved and the power-sharing institutions could be restored with “more focus and work” by politicians.However, Mr Blair also said that voters in the North must demand that their representatives work the mechanisms of the agreement.“At the end of the day, the people of Northern Ireland have to stand up for this agreement at a certain point. They will also exert electoral pressure on the parties,” he said.“They have to make clear to their political leaders from whatever party they want them to find a way through this impasse and the agreement moving forward again. And the moderate parties will be the ones who are advocating this.”Mr Clinton called on Northern politicians to follow the example of their predecessors and make compromises to allow the power-sharing institutions to be restored.“In the end you have to be willing to give. Compromise has to be a good thing, not a dirty word,” Mr Clinton said. “And voters have to stop punishing the politicians who make those compromises and start rewarding them.”He was speaking at the Clinton Institute in UCD, set up to mark the former US president’s contribution to the peace process.The three men will travel to Belfast on Tuesday evening for an event at Queen’s University where they will join the former US senator George Mitchell, who chaired the talks in 1998, in a discussion about the agreement and its future.Meanwhile, three loyalist paramilitary groups, The Ulster Defence Association, Ulster Volunteer Force and Red Hand Commando, yesterday issued a “declaration of transformation” on Monday, their first joint statement since the loyalist ceasefire in 1994, which suggests any members involved in crime will be expelled.“We fully support the rule of law in all areas of life and emphatically condemn all forms of criminal activity,” the statement said.Twenty years after Good Friday we examine the Belfast Agreement and ask is it still fit for purpose?We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3456694.1523341596!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british-labour-politician-calls-belfast-agreement-a-shibboleth-1.3456240","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tShadow trade secretary Barry Gardiner described the agreement as a shibboleth. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty ImagesA senior member of the British Labour Party’s shadow cabinet has accused the Government of playing up the issue of the Border in Brexit negotiations for economic reasons and described the Good Friday Agreement as a “shibboleth”. Barry Gardiner, Britain’s shadow international trade secretary, told a conference in Brussels last month that fears that hardening the Border could bring a return to violence were confusing cause and effect.In a recording of his remarks, which The Irish Times has heard, he said the watchtowers and other physical infrastructure that had been built on the Border during the Troubles were removed 20 years ago to deprive terrorists of a target after the Belfast Agreement.“Now, we went back to that normal border relationship at a time when we were both - the UK and the Republic of Ireland - were in the EU, and so a normal border relationship was a completely friction-free border. “But that doesn’t mean that putting in a normal border relationship when one party is no longer in the EU will bring back paramilitary activity - that is to confuse cause and effect.“And I think we must also recognise that there are real economic reasons why people have played up the issue of the Irish border and the need to have the shibboleth of the Good Friday agreement. And that is because it is hugely in the Republic of Ireland’s economic interest to make sure that there is no tariff and no external border there,” he said.Mr Gardiner was addressing a conference organised by the European trade union movement and the Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung, a political foundation attached to the German Left party, on March 20th. Mr Gardiner went on to ascribe political motives to Sinn Féin’s focus on the Border after Brexit.“And of course there are very good political reasons. Sinn Féin, who are members of this group and trusted colleagues, of course want to see the unification of Ireland and that is a political objective of Sinn Féin. “But it doesn’t mean that a normal border will bring back paramilitary activity. And so, these are deeply unfashionable remarks to make, but actually I do think that we do need to understand that there are economic reasons, there are political reasons, and they do not always concur with what we are putting forward - from all sides - as this shibboleth of the Good Friday Agreement. I think we need to actually start drilling down.”Mr Gardiner was not immediately available for comment but Owen Smith, who was sacked as Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary last month for advocating a second Brexit referendum, condemned the comments.“Labour members will be particularly shocked, but it should concern people in every party and none that there now seems to be a substantial group of senior politicians - from Daniel Hannan to Barry Gardiner - who are prepared to sacrifice the Good Friday Agreement in order to deliver Brexit. “Instead of supporting those in Northern Ireland committed to making the Agreement work, these ideological Brexiters put leaving the EU ahead of everything else. “They must be resisted by all those, who value the achievements of the Agreement, and above all the peace it has brought. If the choice is between Brexit and the Good Friday Agreement, we must support the Agreement every time,” Mr Smith said.We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3456730.1523349799!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"davis-claims-sf-pushed-government-s-hard-stance-on-brexit-1.3456731","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish Brexit Secretary David Davis has claimed Sinn Féin’s growing influence in the Republic has pushed the Irish Government into taking a harder-than-expected stand in the Brexit negotiations. Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesSinn Féin’s growing influence in the Republic has pushed the Irish Government into taking a harder-than-expected stand in the Brexit negotiations , British Brexit Secretary David Davis has claimed.The charge, though much-ridiculed, has been made by a series of Conservative politicians in recent months, such as former Northern Ireland secretary, Owen Paterson, but never by a leading member of the British Cabinet.Speaking at a conference in London, the Brexit Secretary said that he had not anticipated the tough approach to negotiations taken by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who took over from Enda Kenny last June.“We had a change of government, south of the border, and with quite a strong influence from Sinn Féin, and that had an impact in terms of the approach,” he said – though he was corrected by members in the audience, who told him that no change of government had taken place.“We’ll leave our interpretations aside if you like. But the simple truth is that on both sides of the border the politics changed with the change of taoiseach and with the disappearance of the Northern Ireland executive.“That’s quite important. It’s slowed the process down slightly.”In a statement to The London Times, the Irish government quickly rejected Mr Davis’s claims: “(The Irish) position is unchanged since the time of the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership and is one which has cross-party support in Dáil Éireann.”Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney also described the comments as “way off the mark” and “nonsense”.Mr Coveney told RTE’s Morning Ireland that it would help if Mr Davis came to Dublin where he could learn about Irish politics and would realise that the idea of an Irish government being influenced by Sinn Féin was “nonsense”.Meanwhile, five former Northern Ireland secretaries of state have warned about their concerns that the introduction of a hard border between NI and the Republic, saying “that it will lead to instability that could threaten the very existence of the agreement.“The Good Friday Agreement was founded on mutually reinforcing rights and the obligations and cemented through referendums in NI and the Republic of Ireland,” wrote Peter Mandelson, John Reid, Paul Murphy, Peter Hain and Shaun Woodward.“Those who value the agreement and the peace it brought to Northern Ireland have a duty to speak up and make clear their opposition to the (British) Government’s Brexit policy,” the five former senior politicians declared.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3456739.1523351964!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gardiner-apologises-for-remarks-on-good-friday-agreement-1.3456740","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tShadow trade secretary Barry Gardiner described the agreement as a shibboleth.

Photograph: ReutersWhen British prime minister Tony Blair left Downing Street in early April 1998 and headed for Belfast to take charge of the Northern Ireland peace talks with taoiseach Bertie Ahern, it seemed all was on the verge of ruin.The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) was poised to reject the first draft of US special envoy for Northern Ireland George Mitchell’s document on what would eventually become the Belfast Agreement, with the party’s deputy leader, John Taylor, famously declaring he would not touch it “with a 40-foot bargepole”.The Belfast Agreement would go on to become the cornerstone for peace in Northern Ireland, ushering in a new era of co-operation between unionists and nationalists both at the top table of government and in terms of the political structures that stemmed from it.By Tuesday, April 7th, UUP leader David Trimble had rung Blair three times at Downing Street before faxing him a letter rejecting the deal, citing a host of complaints. Later that day Blair arrived in Belfast with his private secretary John Holmes.What occurred over the following days would change the Irish political landscape forever. Yet exhaustion and the speed of events meant that much of the detail leading to the signing of the agreement on April 10th – Good Friday – 1998, has up to now been unknown as no comprehensive minutes were known to have been kept.However, Holmes, who was blessed with good shorthand, did keep a record, which has recently been unearthed by journalist Eamon Mallie. While it is a British version of events, it is one that provides much new insight into the see-saw nature of the talks and the personalities that shaped them.“The situation looked bleak as we arrived,” Holmes wrote.Mitchell’s decision to include two long, unagreed annexes covering North-South co-operation and sections on rights, policing and prisoners, which unionists had not seen before, had pushed them “over the edge” and were “too green for their taste”, Holmes recorded.The British moved swiftly, inviting Trimble to Hillsborough to hear his concerns. “With the important exceptions of the North-South section and decommissioning, these objections did not seem insuperable,” said Holmes. “As important, he still seemed interested in a deal.”They were joined at Hillsborough by Mitchell, who agreed to sweeping changes to his draft to get the unionists on board. They worked through the night on amendments to present to the Irish side the following morning.When Ahern arrived from Dublin for breakfast, Blair outlined the landscape. “Ahern made clear in response that he and his team were ready to have a crack at amending the paper, in particular the North-South part,” wrote Holmes. “But he also stressed his own difficulties, and his fear that if one unionist set of demands was met, another one would quickly appear.”Ahern then returned to Dublin for his mother’s funeral.Holmes said the Irish delegation had been “shaken” by the unionist reaction, and were ready to make “significant changes”. The disputed annexes in Mitchell’s draft were shelved,“The process, therefore, looked as if it might get back on track,” noted Holmes.The agreement sets out a framework for the creation of a number of institutions across three so-called “strands”.Strand one dealt with the democratic institutions, and established the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, while strand two dealt with cross-Border political co-operation such as a North-South ministerial council. The final strand concerned “east-west” issues and institutions to be created between Ireland and Britain.Holmes wrote that there was “great concern” on the nationalist side that unionists were refusing to engage on strand one issues until their concerns about strand two matters were addressed.By prior agreement with Ahern, Blair did not give the UUP the new strand two text “for fear of simply triggering further unionist demands”, wrote Holmes.Ahern would not get back from Dublin until the early evening, and a “frustrating period” followed with no real negotiations. Until Ahern could prove to the unionists that the Irish were up for serious change the process was “effectively stuck”.“When he eventually did arrive for a bilateral with the prime minister, the initial atmosphere was chilly because the Irish mistakenly thought we had been trying to negotiate with Mitchell behind their back over policing and decommissioning,” said Holmes.“Apologies from the prime minister quickly restored relations, and Ahern confirmed he was ready to sign up to the paper on strand two, contingent on the unionists being ready to do a reasonable deal on other issues, notably strand one.This was followed by a crucial tripartite meeting with the unionists. Ahern made clear he was ready to make compromises.“Trimble appreciated Ahern’s return to Belfast from his mother’s funeral and suggested both sides’ political needs could be met,” Holmes recorded, adding that in “a critical intervention” John Taylor now said he thought “proper business could now be done”.It was, therefore, agreed that the UUP and Irish should meet to try to reach agreement on North-South issues. “We subsequently gave the UUP the new text, suggesting that we thought the Irish would be ready to sign up to it,” said Holmes.“The UUP and Irish eventually met late that evening for a long and evidently tense discussion. It did not focus on the new text, as we had hoped, but on the difficult issues.“It was agreed that both sides would go away overnight to draft words to reflect their respective ideas. Some of the Irish side seemed encouraged by the meeting, but Ahern himself commented that it had finished just in time, before blows were exchanged.”“He feared the delay would make things worse – a fear which proved amply justified the following morning. But Ahern was clearly too tired for an all-night session to be possible.”Later that evening Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams came in to see Blair on his own. “He was friendly and philosophical as always, but his underlying message was worrying,” said Holmes, “Sinn Féin wanted to sign up to a deal, but we had to give them a deal they could sign up to.”That had to mean more than the release of prisoners.Blair asked John Hume and Mallon immediately afterwards if they thought Sinn Féin would sign up. Both thought Adams genuinely wanted to do so. But this question was to be a constant preoccupation for the next 36 hours: “We eventually returned to Hillsborough after midnight, frustrated that so little progress had been made.”Early on Thursday, Blair rang Trimble to again say he thought a deal on strand two was possible but that the Irish were in a fragile state. He “should not therefore push his luck too far on other issues”, Blair told Trimble, “and should in particular engage quickly with the SDLP on strand one”. Trimble said he understood.Shortly afterwards, over breakfast with Blair, Ahern voiced his “extreme suspicion” about unionist intentions, recalling past failures to honour promises made in 1921 and 1973. Westminster legislation was needed to ensure that NorthSouth bodies would be created. “The Irish also showed further concern about Sinn Féin’s position,” Holmes added.Back in Castle Buildings at Stormont, a “frustrating morning” passed. “We had assumed both the Irish and UUP had been drafting overnight, but in fact neither had, and a long gap followed,” said Holmes.“It gradually became clear that the two were not capable of solving their problems bilaterally – the mutual distrust and hostility were too great. From now until virtually the end of the talks, we negotiated with both by proxy, and kept them apart.”At midday Trimble brought Blair and Holmes the unionist draft, and “made clear” it would have to be the basis of any deal. He also said decommissioning would be “a show-stopper”.Blair put the proposal to Ahern and “pushed him hard”. The taoiseach accepted that the basis of a deal was there, but again sought Westminster guarantees.Department of Foreign Affairs secretary general Dermot Gallagher studied the text in detail, and suggested more changes. Blair then put the amendments to Trimble, who accepted the essential ones. “A deal appeared to have been struck on strand two, and a breakthrough achieved,” said Holmes.Strand One negotiations now began in earnest, but problems soon appeared. “Word began to reach us of serious difficulties about the new text in the Irish camp ... and unhappiness on the part of Sinn Féin and the SDLP,” wrote Holmes.“It was a disaster. The Irish had altered the balance fundamentally, reintroducing the necessity for Westminster legislation throughout the text, and putting all the responsibility in the hands of the two governments. There was fury on our side that the deal had so quickly fallen apart.”Blair quickly told Ahern the text could not be seriously reopened, but he was ready to see if the UUP would accept lesser changes. He met Trimble and Taylor, and put the Irish changes to them. They accepted four of the six changes, believing that they did not fundamentally alter the balance of the text.“The Irish were in turn satisfied,” said Holmes, “The deal seemed to be back on, and attention could switch back to the wider problem of whether Sinn Féin would sign up to a deal, not least since Ahern had made it increasingly clear that a deal would be almost impossible for the Irish if they did not.“Ahern had already spent hours with Adams trying to persuade him the deal was worth accepting, and listening to Sinn Féin demands for improvements, particularly on policing, security, the Irish language and prisoners,” he wrote.Northern secretary Mo Mowlam had spent much of the previous two days on the latter subject, with the British side “deliberately refusing to reveal our hand”, he said.However, Sinn Féin’s public line had turned negative. Fearing collapse, there were “two very long meetings” with just Blair and Ahern on one side, and Adams and Martin McGuinness on the other. This was followed by a 3am telephone call to Adams from US president Bill Clinton, which “seemed to turn the tide”.“It eventually became clear early in the morning of April 10th that, while they would not sign up to the deal on the spot, not least because of their annual conference a week later, they were ready to make positive noises about it and argue for it.“It was made clear in return that while we would stick for now to the planned two-year release deadline for prisoners, we would be ready to advance this if Sinn Féin did sign up and circumstances allowed.”Early on Friday morning the UUP accepted the essence of what they had rejected for so long: a Northern Ireland Executive with a first minister and deputy first minister, and a reasonable form of sufficient cross-community consensus for voting on key issues.“Exhaustion was combined with a degree of satisfaction and optimism,” said Holmes. “But we were also uncomfortably aware that there was bound to be a last-minute obstacle, and the UUP would no doubt find reasons to dislike the texts.”A mini-crisis then arose over the annex listing the areas where separate or joint North-South implementation bodies would be set up. The Irish were unhappy since just 12 were proposed, together with the fact that few of them were what they had wanted.They claimed to have persuaded the UUP during the night to accept an Irish language promotion body and a trade Promotion and indigenous company development body, both of which the UUP had fiercely resisted. “We stupidly took their word for it,” said Holmes.“When the UUP saw the new list they blew a fuse, accused the Irish of duplicity and refused to accept any more than the original list. The Irish in turn dug in their heels, and a lengthy impasse followed, with Mitchell (whose role in the previous 48 hours had effectively been zero) unable to circulate a new text and getting increasingly angry.“We were also tearing our hair out. Eventually the prime minister brought Ahern and Trimble together again. Trimble had been given fierce instructions by his colleagues not to accept another body or not to bother coming back. He was adamant. Ahern pressed, but in vain.“Eventually Trimble, at his most boorish, was persuaded to propose again a pretty meaningless health body. We sold this to an unhappy Ahern on the basis of an additional reference in the text to other bodies being considered and an exchange of letters with Trimble where Ahern set out four Irish requests again, and Trimble agreed to consider them later.“This fudge allowed the text to be circulated around midday. We sat back and waited for the next problems,” Holmes added.They were not long in coming. First, the UUP insisted the Anglo-Irish secretariat at Maryfield be closed by the end of the year, but the Irish resisted further concessions to the UUP.“Faced with the prospect of selling to their community a deal involving Sinn Féin at the Assembly and government table with no guarantee of decommissioning, with all prisoners out in two years...they were losing their nerve.”Blair spoke to Trimble several times by phone. “We deployed all the big picture arguments we could,” said Holmes. “But Trimble still seemed to be losing the argument and to share most of his colleagues’ reservations. It began to look hopeless, and despair took hold.”Trimble eventually brought a senior UUP delegation to see Blair. “All effectively said the text was unacceptable and unsaleable to unionists,” said Holmes. “The prime minister let his despair show but said he was ready to help if he could, but not by reopening the text itself.“The delegation made clear that the single biggest issue was the prospect of sitting round the cabinet table with Sinn Féin when there had been no decommissioning. The prime minister promised to consider this.“When they had left we concocted a letter to Trimble making clear that, if after six months of the Assembly the present rules to promote non-violent methods had proved ineffective, we would support changing the rules to give them teeth.“We sent this off without much hope, and meanwhile enlisted Clinton’s help through a direct phone call to Trimble. The cause still looked all but hopeless, although Trimble had said one or two things which suggested he was determined to make his colleagues swallow the agreement.”Suddenly, at about 4.30pm, the picture changed again. “Rumours reached us that, following the prime minister’s letter and Clinton’s call, Trimble had taken renewed heart and called a vote, which he had narrowly won.“This seemed too good to be true, but Trimble quickly rang to confirm that the way was now clear for the plenary to be held, and Mitchell arranged it for 5pm.”The plenary itself was relatively devoid of drama. The vote was swift. “And that was it,” said Holmes. “There was no applause when sufficient consensus was achieved – just a stunned silence.”Twenty years after Good Friday we examine the Belfast Agreement and ask is it still fit for purpose?We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"social-affairs","story":"Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3456036.1523296865!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"alarm-at-apparent-lack-of-urgency-in-repeal-campaign-1.3456037","story":"Together for Yes, an umbrella group advocating a Yes vote in the upcoming referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment, launches its poster campaign in Dublin. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTogether for Yes co-director Grainne Griffin at the campaign launch on Dublin’s Mount Street on Monday morning.Photograph: Cyril Byrne The leaders of the Together for Yes campaign gathered in Dublin on Monday to publicise the launch of their postering campaign in advance of the referendum on May 25th.Cameras clicked as T-shirted activists ascended poles. But many of the poles the campaigners and workers decorated with their message already had competing messages – the anti-repeal campaigners had beaten them to it.In many cases, they had already been there for nearly a fortnight, since the day the referendum was formally called and it became legal to put up posters. For some repeal supporters, it was a worrying sign that they are weeks behind the anti-repeal campaigners – in publicity, fundraising, canvassing and implementing a campaign strategy.“No,” says Orla O’Connor, co-chair of the Together for Yes campaign. “We are exactly where we want to be, it’s exactly how we planned it.”As of this week, she says, groups are now canvassing in all parts of the country. They are crowdfunding a possible second national poster run. They are connecting with the political parties, and will be co-ordinating local canvass groups all over the country with them. They’ll be meeting Fine Gael campaign chair Josepha Madigan this week.“It was only in the last 10 days of the marriage equality referendum that a lot of the donations came in,” O’Connor says. “That only happens when people engage with the campaign and that’s only beginning now.”There are certainly similarities with the referendum campaign on same-sex marriage. But there are also differences, one of the main ones being that there wasn’t much of an organised campaign against the marriage proposal.By contrast, there is a very well-organised, well-funded and committed campaign against the abortion proposal.“The postering also helps us frame the debate,” says McGuirk. “The comparison with the situation in the UK is a very, very important comparison for us to make.”Campaign observers agree that the anti-repeal side has had the better of the early running.“Look at the No side, look at how they have constructed and progressed their message since January,” says one pro-repeal public affairs consultant, who has looked back over the campaign since January. “They’ve done it in a series of three-or four-week blocks. It’s all very disciplined, very clear. You know, the voices on the radio match the slogans on the posters and the leaflets coming through the doors. There’s a great message consistency.”Clearly, anti-abortion campaigners have been getting ready for this fight for a long time. But some repealers are wondering why they haven’t been preparing with the same urgency. It is not, after all, as if the referendum was a surprise.Privately, some anti-abortion figures say that they are a “bit mystified” by the repeal campaign so far.Nervous repealers do not entirely disagree with them.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum hereThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3454902.1523211484!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"berlin-irish-campaign-to-repeal-eighth-amendment-1.3454909","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBanner at Bei Ruth, a warehouse hidden inside a bare industrial estate between Berlin’s erse Neukölln and Treptow areas. Photograph: Rachel LoxtonIf it wasn’t for a giant poster of a pair of knickers on the wall, it would look like a typical Friday night at a Berlin club.The poster, with “Repeal the 8th” written across it in red, is attached to the wall with masking tape. It brightens up the venue, a party warehouse hidden inside a bare industrial estate, sandwiched between Berlin’s erse Neukölln and Treptow areas.Tonight the venue has become a gathering for Irish people – more than 1,300km away from where the referendum on May 25th will take place.The referendum will ask voters if they want to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which grants equal right to life to the mother and unborn child.The Berlin-Ireland pro-choice solidarity group organised “Plugged in for Repeal” to highlight how people can vote in the referendum or campaign, as well as raise money and remove the stigma of abortion.Dozens of people have already arrived at 9.30pm.\u0026nbspThe atmosphere is intense but cheerful as conversation moves from serious talk on the effects of the Eighth Amendment to “soli shots” (solidarity shots) and homemade Guinness cake.Is this an occasion to celebrate or prepare for the fight ahead? Both it seems.Maebh Murphy, from Waterford, moved to Berlin in 2008. The 33 year old, who works in the music industry, co-founded the pro-choice group with Dervla O’Malley, in 2012.She says “the buzz” of the party is because the referendum is finally happening – and feels fairly positive about the outcome.Under Irish electoral law, Irish citizens retain their right to vote for 18 months after moving abroad. There is no postal vote from abroad so eligible voters must travel back to have their say.Although she can’t vote, Murphy wants to go back to Ireland with her husband, who’s from Cork, and their three-year-old daughter but is unsure if the family can afford it.Despite being fervently pro-choice, she can understand arguments on the other side.“I would never talk about a clump of cells because people in my family have gone through miscarriages,” she says. “I totally understand the different feelings towards it and I also think you can make your own choice yourself.”But she feels angry about pro-life lobbyists using children with Down syndrome in their campaigns.When she was pregnant, Murphy was given the choice of receiving a chromosome abnormalities test in Germany but decided against it.“It’s just really insulting to think that if you had the choice then the only choice you would make is to abort all the babies because this is not the case. People will still have kids.”Cora Quigley, from Dublin, moved to Berlin in January last year. The 28 year old’s time abroad is within the 18-month limit so she will fly back to vote and is doing all she can to raise the issue.“I’ve already had a discussion with my mother which went really well,” says Quigley. “It’s important to have conversations in your family because people don’t really talk about it. Even people who appear liberal in other ways might be on the fence.”PhD geography student Lorna O’Hara splits her time between her home city of Dublin and Berlin.The 30 year old, who can vote and will return, has also been having difficult conversations.“It’s hard to look at someone who you love and know their opinion is so different,” says O’Hara. “I’ve been an activist for six years, I know the facts. But when I sat down with my mother all of that flew out the window because you just fall apart.“I think it was the emotion in that conversation that got her to see it from my perspective.”Clíodhna Walsh, a writer from Waterford, says being unable to cast a postal vote is a major disadvantage. “I haven’t found a job yet in Berlin but I’m going to book flights anyway and hope for the best.”As a doula who helps women in pregnancy and abortion, 27-year-old Kilkenny-born Jes Walsh,\u0026nbspwho has been in Berlin for five years and will go back to Ireland to campaign, says: “I don’t see abortion as an act of violence. I see it as violence when you hold people back from their choices.”The group was launched six years ago after the death of Savita Halappanavar at University Hospital Galway due to the complications of a septic miscarriage.“We had quite a few protests outside the Irish Embassy and vigils,” says co-founder Dervla O’Malley, from Galway. “Every year on the anniversary of Savita’s death we hold a vigil.”O’Malley, who has been making sure the event runs smoothly, says the money raised will go to abortion rights and support groups in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.“This referendum is well overdue,” she says. “We’ve waited a long time for this.”Outside, the industrial estate is cold and grey – the opposite of the electric atmosphere among the Irish expats. Physically they are in Berlin.

possibly 90,000 - making it the \u0026quotoldest directly-dated homo sapiens\u0026quot fossil ever found outside of Africa and the Levant.Huw Groucutt, the study’s co-author from the University of Oxford, said its age served as rare evidence that \u0026quotour species was spreading beyond Africa much earlier than previously thought.”It is the first fossil of a hominin - the group of humans and our direct ancestors - discovered in what is Saudi Arabia today.Humans were previously thought to have left Africa in a single wave, moving along the coast from Africa via southern Arabia and India all the way to Australia.But Prof Petraglia said the finger showed \u0026quotthat modern humans were moving across the interior, the terrestrial heart, of Eurasia - not along the coastlines.”The bone was discovered in an area known as Al Wusta that 90,000 years ago would have looked very different to the desert it is today, with plentiful rivers and lakes.It was found with a collection of 380 stone tools nearby, suggesting that groups of tens of humans would have been living at the site.The team also found fossils of various animals, including hippos, as well as advanced stone tools.They said it all pointed to the owner of the finger having been a member of a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer group moving after water and animals.Other archaeological finds, which some have claimed are even older, may very well be authentic but were not directly dated, the researchers said.Most had their age calculated from the sand or rock layers they were found in, or other items in the vicinity.The research is published in the journal Nature Ecology \u0026amp Evolution.Royal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest news\u0026#39Attorney-client privilege is dead!\u0026#39 Donald Trump tweets in furious reply after FBI raids lawyer\u0026#39s officeShrine to career criminal outside burglary victim\u0026#39s home is destroyedThe world\u0026#39s busiest airports – Dubai inches closer to the top spotMuch Apu about nothing: why calling The Simpsons racist misses the pointMarcella, episode 8 review – this crime drama truly stretched plausibility to its limitYulia Skripal, poisoned spy\u0026#39s daughter, discharged from hospital and taken to a secure locationQueen jokes that noisy plane \u0026#39sounds like President Trump\u0026#39 during cordial chat with Sir David AttenboroughA wild elephant goes on a two day tour of a Chinese cityPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsTracey Emin: \u0026#39I was sexually assaulted by a famous female artist\u0026#39\u0026#39First luxury hotel in space\u0026#39 set to welcome guests by 2022 (reservations now open)Trump promises \u0026#39forceful\u0026#39 response on Syria and France warns of \u0026#39red line\u0026#39 as US Navy destroyer heads to regionReese Witherspoon and the Big Little Lies cast convince HBO to close its gender pay gapChina denies moves toward second military base abroad on tiny Pacific island nation of VanuatuSchool expulsions fuel rise in youth crime, say expertsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding cake: royal bakes through the agesComment: The Left doesn\u0026#39t care to ask why Hungary\u0026#39s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is genuinely popularSmog forces South Korean pupils to practise virtual sports indoorsWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/10/TELEMMGLPICT000136141498_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"china eyes tiny pacific island nation vanuatu second military","story":"Soldiers commemorate the 90th anniversary of the foundation of China\u0026#39s People\u0026#39s Liberation Army (PLA) at Zhurihe military base in Inner Mongolia Autonomous RegionChina wants to establish a military base on a tiny Pacific island of Vanuatu, located about 1,200 miles from Australia, a report said, amid growing concern about Beijing\u0027s increasing influence in the region.The facility, which would be China\u0027s second overseas base, would not only signal a new stage in Beijing\u0027s growing military ambition, but also alter the delicate balance of power in the South Pacific.However officials in Vanuatu angrily rejected they had spoken to Chinese officials about the facility -

weight loss has long been associated with cancerWeight loss in patients over the age of 60 should be urgently investigated, with one in seven cases among men likely to mean cancer, a major study has found.The research by Oxford University found that losing weight is the key symptom of the disease, linked to at least 10 types of cancer.Experts called on GPs to refer patients with unexplained weight loss for urgent tests, in a bid to speed up diagnosis.Britain’s survival rates are lagging behind may comparative countries, with the UK falling in the bottom half of international league tables for seven major forms of the disease.Unexplained weight loss has long been associated with cancer.But Tuesday’s research, involving more than 11 million patients, is the first major study to quantify the association.Overall it found that among those over 60, men with unintended weight loss had a 14.2 per cent risk of cancer, with a 6.7 per cent risk found among women of the same age.Experts said the higher rate among men was found because weight loss was closely linked to prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men.Lead author Dr Brian Nicholson, of the University of Oxford, said GPs needed to be able to refer patients to centres which could check for several cancers at once, in order to make the right diagnosis quickly.Last week health officials announced plans to test such an approach in 10 parts of the country.Dr Nicholson said: “Streamlined services that allow GPs to investigate non-specific symptoms like weight loss are vitally important and urgently needed if we are to catch cancer earlier and save lives.”He said more research was needed to establish the amount of weight loss which constituted grounds for concern.“Our research indicates that coordinated investigation across multiple body sites could help to speed up cancer diagnosis in patients with weight loss,” he said.“We now need to continue our research to understand the most appropriate combination of tests and to give guidance on how much weight loss GPs and patients should worry about.”.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:0}.html-embed.component

.quote.component{margin-left:-82.33px}}We’ve always known that unplanned weight loss may represent cancerProfessor Willie Hamilton, study co-authorLeading GPs said patient access to tests for cancer was among the lowest in EuropeA team led by the Universities of Oxford and Exeter examined 25 studies, involving 11.5 million patients.Their study, funded by the National Institute for Health Research and published in the British Journal of General Practice, found that unintended weight loss was the second highest risk factor for colorectal, lung, pancreatic and renal cancers.The only symptoms found to be more common were those linked to specific cancers, such as rectal bleeding, for bowel cancer, and jaundice for pancreatic disease.Co-author Professor Willie Hamilton, from the University of Exeter, said: “We’ve always known that unplanned weight loss may represent cancer. This study pulls together all the published evidence and demonstrates beyond doubt that it is important in efforts to save lives from cancer.”Everything you need to know about prostate cancer but were too afraid to GoogleDr Richard Roope, clinical lead for cancer at the Royal College of GPs, said: \u0026quotCurrently there are no clinical guidelines to support GPs and their teams in how to respond to or investigate patients who present with weight loss, without other symptoms, in the cancer setting.\u0026quotThese important findings present strong evidence of the correlation between significant unexplained weight loss and many cancers, and should certainly be taken on board as clinical guidelines for GPs and healthcare professionals are updated and developed.\u0026quotWe agree with the researchers\u0027 recommendations that GPs need better access to diagnostic tools in the community across the UK so that we can appropriately refer patients to either rule out or confirm a diagnosis of cancer, as currently our access is among the lowest in Europe.\u0026quotA spokesperson for NHS England said: “Rapid and accurate diagnosis is vital for all cancers. Patients are now being tested sooner with investment in greater diagnostic capacity including in one-stop cancer diagnostic services across the country.\u0026quotThese new one-stop-shops represent a real step change in the way people with unclear symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, appetite loss or abdominal pain are identified, diagnosed and treated.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policy\u0026#39Attorney-client privilege is dead!\u0026#39 Donald Trump tweets in furious reply after FBI raids lawyer\u0026#39s officeShrine to career criminal outside burglary victim\u0026#39s home is destroyedThe world\u0026#39s busiest airports – Dubai inches closer to the top spotMuch Apu about nothing: why calling The Simpsons racist misses the pointMarcella, episode 8 review – this crime drama truly stretched plausibility to its limitYulia Skripal, poisoned spy\u0026#39s daughter, discharged from hospital and taken to a secure locationQueen jokes that noisy plane \u0026#39sounds like President Trump\u0026#39 during cordial chat with Sir David AttenboroughA wild elephant goes on a two day tour of a Chinese cityPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsTracey Emin: \u0026#39I was sexually assaulted by a famous female artist\u0026#39\u0026#39First luxury hotel in space\u0026#39 set to welcome guests by 2022 (reservations now open)Trump promises \u0026#39forceful\u0026#39 response on Syria and France warns of \u0026#39red line\u0026#39 as US Navy destroyer heads to regionReese Witherspoon and the Big Little Lies cast convince HBO to close its gender pay gapChina denies moves toward second military base abroad on tiny Pacific island nation of VanuatuSchool expulsions fuel rise in youth crime, say expertsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding cake: royal bakes through the agesComment: The Left doesn\u0026#39t care to ask why Hungary\u0026#39s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is genuinely popularSmog forces South Korean pupils to practise virtual sports indoorsKim Jong-un breaks silence on talks with Donald TrumpWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"wild elephant goes two day tour chinese city","story":"Police captured a wild Asian elephant that was lost on the streets of Pu\u0027er City of southwest China\u0027s Yunnan Province on Sunday.The male elephant was spotted twice in two days wandering the streets and parks of the city.The elephant entered Pu\u0027er downtown area through a suburban tea plantation on Saturday night.The curious animal was herded out of the city on early Sunday by local forest police but was found walking around the city again on Sunday night, forcing the local authorities to take emergency actions.The endangered Asian elephant is listed as a first-class protected animal in China.
