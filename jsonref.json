In that time, more than 20,000 people took part in the show seeking help to resolve relationship issues, or to address drug or alcohol related problems. \u0027The central purpose of the show was conflict resolution, and the show achieved many positive outcomes where people were able to resolve personal problems.\u0027The Jeremy Kyle Show had extensive and detailed duty of care processes in place for contributors built up over 14 years. \u0027It had a dedicated guest welfare team of mental healthcare professionals with decades of experience in NHS mental healthcare, who were focused on the welfare of guests throughout the production process. \u0027Guests were supported by the programme and welfare teams prior to filming, throughout filming and after filming. \u0027Should they require ongoing help then appropriate solutions were found for them, which could include residential rehabilitation, counselling, anger management, family mediation, child access mediation or couples counselling.\u0027Due to the gravity of events in May 2019, namely the death of a guest a few days after taking part in the show, ITV decided to end production of the show. \u0027It would not be appropriate for ITV to comment further on that in advance of the inquest to be held later this month, other than to say that our sympathies are with Mr Dymond\u0027s family and friends.\u0027ITV does not accept the central allegation of this programme of a \u0027bad culture\u0027 within the production team. \u0027We note that the programme includes anonymous former production members claiming wrongdoing by themselves and others, without supporting evidence. ITV would never condone any of its production staff misleading or lying to guests. \u0027All guests on the Jeremy Kyle Show were aware of the nature of the show and the presenter\u0027s style before taking part in recording. Most of those who applied to appear watched the show themselves. All guests gave their informed consent, in writing, to take part.\u0027Since 2018 ITV has taken significant steps in relation to its duty of care of participants. ITV issued detailed new guidance to all its producers on protecting participants in October 2019, which represents industry-leading good practice and now reflects the changes to the Broadcasting Code made by industry regulator Ofcom in 2021. \u0027ITV also ensures greater management oversight of participant welfare through a Duty of Care Board, and has created a Mental Health Advisory group involving mental health charities to advise ITV on its policies for staff and programme guests.\u0027Channel 4 said: \u0027Jeremy Kyle was approached for a response to the series.

Whilst it might deter some people from going out, it might incentivise others for going out. I think there\u0027s a difficult balance to take there.\u0027There were 1,996 people in Scottish hospitals on Monday with recently confirmed Covid, up 191 on the previous day, with 33 in intensive care, up six.That is higher than the Omicron peak of 1,571 which was recorded in January this year, with more patients in hospital than at any time since January 27 last year when the total was 2,016.Dr Tait Burkard, a research fellow at the University of Edinburgh\u0027s Roslin Institute and an expert on coronaviruses, said that while masks help reduce virus levels in public places, they are less effective against Omicron and BA.2.She suggested that vulnerable people should be advised to upgrade their masks to FFP2 or N95 masks for more protection.The academic said: \u0027The impacts that the mask wearing makes without many of the other restrictions in place is small, or it\u0027s smaller than it ever was before.\u0027One (reason) is that unfortunately with Omicron the kind of less protective masks, the simple surgical masks, the thin ones that you just ring round your ears, the fabric ones, they\u0027re not as protective as they were against the previous variants, just because we need to inhale less of the virus to get infected, so both time of exposure needed to get infected is less, but they still help reducing virus level in public places, and especially for vulnerable people that can make the difference.\u0027But there should be also the advice that for vulnerable people it might be a good moment, or probably a very pertinent moment, to upgrade masks to so-called FFP2 or N95 masks, the thicker ones that fit very closely around your face to protect yourself more than others.\u0027Fourth round of Covid vaccinations could start next week after slow rollout criticised"},{"url":null,"title":"Legal limit pollution HALVED 2040 campaigners criticise incredibly weak target","story":"Share this article Current estimates suggest air pollution contributes to about 40,000 deaths in the UK every year.Ministers are announcing the reduction in air pollution limits as part of the post-Brexit Environment Bill, which will also set legally-binding aims for water quality, wildlife, waste reduction and resource efficiency.They will all be put out to an eight-week consultation. The PM2.5 limit of 2040 is just five years after the UK will switch to only selling new electric cars.Ministers have repeatedly claimed leaving the EU has enabled them to beef-up targets for reducing air pollution.The bloc has set its annual average limit to 20mcgm3.But the mother of nine-year-old Ella who last year became the first person to have pollution listed as her cause of death in the UK today called on the Government to go further.Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah told The Times: \u0027The Government has failed the whole nation and betrayed my daughter\u0027s memory by proposing this incredibly weak target.\u0027She accused ministers of ignoring recommendations from Ella\u0027s inquest, which saw the Government urged to stick to WHO guidelines for air pollution.Katie Neild, a lawyer at environmental charity Client Earth, told the newspaper: \u0027The target date the Government is proposing means that another generation will be exposed to toxic pollution far above what the world\u0027s scientists think is acceptable.\u0027  Environment Minister Rebecca Pow said: \u0027We are setting out today a new approach to restoring our natural world, including improved protections for habitats and new long-term legally binding environment targets.\u0027EU directives have not done enough to halt the decline of nature.

they were both jailed on trumped-up national security charges, a familiar tactic in Iran. \u0027Nazanin and Anoosheh have unquestionably been used as political pawns by the Iranian authorities - and the Iranian authorities have acted with calculated cruelty, seeking to wring the maximum diplomatic value out of their captivity.\u0027The Government needs to follow up on Nazanin and Anoosheh\u0027s release by immediately renewing its calls for the release of the UK nationals Mehran Raoof and Morad Tahbaz, both of whom are still going through an ordeal all too similar to Nazanin and Anoosheh\u0027s.\u0027It\u0027s been clear for years that the Iranian authorities are targeting foreign nationals with spurious national security-related charges to exert diplomatic pressure, and it\u0027s more important than ever that Britain works multilaterally to combat this insidious practice.\u0027Morad Tahbaz, an Iranian-American who also holds British nationality, was arrested alongside other environmentalists in January 2018 and sentenced to 10 years in jail for \u0027conspiring with America\u0027.Dual nationals from Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Sweden and the United States have also been arrested in similar circumstances.Redress, an anti-torture group which has campaigned for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe to be freed, said it congratulated the UK Government on \u0027finally negotiating her release\u0027.Director Rupert Skilbeck said: \u0027We are incredibly relieved that Nazanin will finally be reunited with her family in the UK after a horrific six-year ordeal.

Three British-trained runners - Bravemansgame, L’Homme Presse and Ahoy Senor – head the market, and all seem likely to race towards the head of affairs, raising the juicy prospect of a three-way duel from the off. That would test the accuracy of their jumping at speed, and while all three have looked very solid in that department so far, it might be worth remembering that Ahoy Senor was not as slick as Bravemansgame in the Grade One Kauto Star Novice Chase at Kempton at Christmas. Ahoy Senor has about seven lengths to find with Paul Nicholls’s runner on that form, and the betting suggests that the race may boil down to a head-to-head between Bravemansgame and L’Homme Presse, who arrive with very similar, unbeaten profiles over fences including a Grade One win apiece. Bravemansgame is proven over today’s three-mile trip whereas L’Homme Presse has so far raced at around two-and-a-half. He is very likely to get another four furlongs, but for betting purposes, Bravemansgame looks a slightly safer option.  The Irish challenge, meanwhile, should not be overlooked, as Willie Mullins’s Capodanno ran really well to finish within five lengths of the classy Bob Olinger at Punchestown in January before unseating at the fifth in a Grade One at Leopardstown last month. Well, perhaps as ine retribution for O’Leary pulling the Tiger out of next month’s Grand National, the rain has come by the bucket-load. The first drops fell at around 9.30am and it’s been raining steadily ever since. It’s currently chucking it down with just over an hour to go to the first race. Tiger Roll will almost certainly take his chance but his chances of victory are diminishing by the minute.I can indeed – a “bumper” is the nickname given for a flat race (no hurdles or fences) for horses being trained towards jumps. It used to be solely the domain of amateur jockeys, whose riding style wasn’t always the smoothest as they “bumped” their horse towards the finish line.The first odds-on shot of the meeting duly obliged on Tuesday and Sir Gerhard will attempt to keep the ball rolling for the shorties in Wednesday’s opener, having been steered around a meeting with Constitution Hill in yesterday’s Supreme – probably very wisely, as it turned out – in favour of a crack at this longer trip. He arrives on the back of two wins from two starts over hurdles, but he will need to jump rather better than he did in a Grade One at Leopardstown last time if he is going to stamp his class on this field.  Willie Mullins will have been working on that since, of course, and Sir Gerhard has finished several lengths in front of Three Stripe Life, the second-favourite, both in last year’s Champion Bumper and his latest race. The longer trip today will also give him a little more room for manoeuvre and it would be a surprise if he failed to see it out, but he is one of those likely winners that is easy to ignore for betting purposes when there are so many alternatives elsewhere on the card. Journey With Me and Stage Star have also both shown enough so far to suggest that they could be in the same parish as the favourite with normal improvement. Journey With Me in particular will be a popular each-way alternative with Rachael Blackmore taking the reins. Hopefully it will not have any significant effect on the big race of the day – and quite possibly the week – when Nicky Henderson’s Shishkin lines up against Energumene in the Queen Mother Champion Chase, a rematch after their epic first encounter in the Clarence House Chase at Ascot in January. With Chacun Pour Soi, last year’s beaten favourite, joining his stable companion in the field – having also been anointed as the better of his two runners by Willie Mullins – the stage is set for one of the great Festival occasions.  This is the only Grade One at the meeting that Mullins has yet to win, and it is not for want of trying, with Chacun Pour Soi (8-13), Douvan (2-9) and Un De Sceaux (4-6) all failing to deliver in the last six years. Shishkin, though, is a daunting opponent, unbeaten in 10 starts since falling at the second on his hurdling debut. He was just a length in front of Energumene in the Clarence House, which will give Mullins cause for hope, but after a stronger-than-expected start for British stables on Tuesday, he is certain to set off as a strong favourite to get another home win on the board.  Forty minutes after one outstanding horse goes into the record books in the Champion Chase, another great favourite will take his leave, as the dual Grand National and five-time Festival winner, Tiger Roll, bows out in the Cross Country Chase. Win or lose, the Tiger is going to get a rousing send-off from the fans, but a win would be the perfect end to a Cheltenham career which started with victory in the two-mile Triumph Hurdle in 2014. The only previous six-time winner at the Festival is Quevega, who took the Mares’ Hurdle six times in a row, and by coincidence her first foal, Facile Vega, is expected to go off as favourite for the Bumper at the end of the card.  Regular updates on the betting, rainfall gauges and other news will be here as they arrive through the day, and the first race will be off, as ever, at 1.30pm.

Photograph:iStockMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has said that the Government is doing all it can about energy prices, but that it cannot cover all of the extra costs being faced by people and businesses this year.“I absolutely appreciate that the higher costs that many are facing at the moment are going to be really difficult,” he told Newstalk Breakfast.“I appreciate that, on top of everything else that we have to deal with — the rising prices, the bills that are going up — just adds to the challenge that lots face at the moment.”The Government expressed “strong concern” at the move by Bord Gáis Energy to increase its gas and electricity prices by 39 per cent and 27 per cent respectively.Blaming high global wholesale energy costs and market volatility for the increases, the company said uncertainty and spiking prices were “expected to continue for some time”.Bord Gáis Energy said the increases would add about €350 a year to the average household’s annual gas bill and €340 to the average annual electricity bill. However, Daragh Cassidy of price comparison and switching website bonkers.ie said the average increase would be more like €390.The latest increase comes after the company imposed two separate price increases last year which saw the annual cost of domestic energy for its customers climbing by in excess of €500.Mr Donohoe said he accepted that the changes made by the Government with regard to taxation and the energy rebate would not cover all the costs facing families and businesses.It was important to emphasise that the Government could not insulate the economy and businesses, or “even out” bills from all of the changes that were happening, many because of the war in Ukraine. These were matters beyond the influence and control of the Government.Anything the Government could do, they are doing, he added.“That which we can influence, in terms of bringing the cost down through the changes that we are making, we are doing. I accept it doesn’t cover all of the cost, but with all of the different things our country is having to deal with at the moment, it’s important we also have the money to make progress on those.”Minimising costsIt comes as the chairperson of the Commission for Energy Regulation, Aoife MacEvilly, has said that the body will look at every option to minimise energy cost increases for customers.The Commission cannot regulate prices, she told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland, but they were looking at ways to protect customers in arrears from disconnection.Some people were in real difficulty because of the rise in energy prices, she said. The Commission would look at ways to enhance protections, stop disconnections and help people agree payment plans with energy providers.Price caps had not worked in the UK and would not work because they could not protect against increases in the wholesale cost of gas on international markets, she added.Ms MacEvilly said that the Commission would look at “every opportunity” to protect customers. She encouraged people to read their bills carefully to see if there were steps that could be taken to avoid price increases such as utilising lower evening and weekend rates.Using energy in different ways could reduce bills, she said."},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre.

punishing one despot for starting a war in Europe requires cosying up to another in the Middle East.Mr Johnson says the barbaric actions of Vladimir Putin in invading Ukraine are “testing not just Ukraine but all of humanity” and Britain must respond by moving away from “dependence on Russian oil”.As Britain’s Russian energy boycott contributes to pushing oil prices to record highs at home, the Government says that “demand can be met by alternative suppliers”.So it is with cap in hand that Mr Johnson will fly to Riyadh, one of the few oil producers with the spare capacity to immediately ramp up production, to ask Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to pump more oil to ease prices.While Mr Johnson has condemned Mr Putin for launching an illegal invasion in which Ukrainian civilians have been indiscriminately targeted in their homes, hospitals and schools, he is far more circumspect about Saudi Arabia\u0027s 36-year-old de facto leader, with whom he reportedly corresponds via WhatsApp messenger. Mr Johnson views Riyadh as “a partner”, his spokesman said last week, which means the kingdom’s de facto leader is not subject to the same criticism as Putin.Thus it is not thought Mr Johnson will publicly speak out against the kingdom carrying out the largest mass executions in its history over the weekend. It also puts Mr Johnson at odds with Joe Biden, the US president, who was elected promising to challenge Saudi human rights abuses and hold Prince Mohammed to account for the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Likewise, Saudi Arabia’s disastrous air war in Yemen is not likely to be subject to the same criticism as Putin’s Ukraine invasion.A war more distant and entrenched than Ukraine, Yemen’s seven-year-old conflict is nonetheless described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. It is also fuelled by billions of pounds worth of British arms sales to Saudi Arabia.British-made bombs and planes have been implicated in scores of Saudi strikes that have killed civilians. Over half of the Saudi air force aircraft flying sorties over the country are UK-supplied, according to the Campaign Against Arms Trade, with some even dropping UK-made cluster munitions on the impoverished country.Saudi Arabia says it is defending itself against Iran-aligned Houthi rebels, which have attacked the kingdom with drones and missile strikes. But its air campaign has faced accusations of indiscriminately targeting civilians, while a blockade of Houthi-controlled areas has contributed to pushing the country to the brink of famine.Rather than pressuring Saudi Arabia to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict, Mr Johnson may be asked to pledge further weapons sales or British support for Riyadh’s security policy towards Yemen and arch-rival Iran, according to Sanam Vakil, deputy director of Chatham House’s Middle East programme.“If there is an agreement over Saudi supply I think the UK could commit to supporting the Saudi position on security issues in the region,” said Ms Vakil. Facing a cost of living crisis at home and a war in Europe that threatens to escalate, Mr Johnson may have to calculate whether that is a price worth paying for Saudi Arabia agreeing to increase oil production.More from NewsNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe latest news: British aid worker on plane home from IranPolitics latest news: Ukraine will not join Nato \u0026#39any time soon\u0026#39, says Boris Johnson‘Fortress New Zealand’ is no more, as country set to reopen borders after two yearsUkraine-Russia lunchtime briefing: Five developments as dissident TV protester tells countrymen \u0026#39open your eyes to propaganda\u0026#39Met police officers plead not guilty to sharing ‘offensive’ messages with Wayne CouzensMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ancient tombs found notre dame remarkable discovery builders","story":"Archaeologists working at Paris’ Notre-Dame Cathedral have made two “exceptional” discoveries, including a lead sarcophagus believed to be from the 1300s containing a “well preserved” body.The objects, described by the French culture ministry as being “of remarkable scientific quality”, were unearthed during preparatory work for rebuilding the church’s famous lead spire, which was destroyed in a massive fire in April 2019.Reconstruction workers were preparing to install scaffolding in the ground to rebuild the 300ft tall spire when they stumbled across the items underneath the rubble.During a visit to the cathedral on Tuesday, a team of archaeologists showed Roselyne Bachelot, France’s culture minister, around the excavation site, explaining how they used a mini endoscopic camera to examine the body located inside the lead sarcophagus, which was partially punctured.“We saw a very well preserved body,” Christophe Besnier, the lead archaeologist said. “You can glimpse pieces of fabric, hair and above all a pillow of leaves on top of the head, a well-known phenomenon when religious leaders were buried.”Mr Besnier added: “The fact that these plant elements are still inside means the body is in a very good state of conservation.”While the identity of the body is unknown, preliminary findings suggest the coffin was made for a senior dignitary sometime in the 1300s. Some 400 bodies have been buried at Notre-Dame since the 13th-century, including bishops, archbishops and canons.Archaeologists working at the site said the discoveries would help improve their understanding of funeral practices during the Middle Ages.Also unearthed was a piece of a rood screen - an ornate partition that was a typical feature of Medieval churches.The excavation, which began on February 2, is being carried out by the Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research. The culture ministry has now agreed to extend the institute’s work until March 25, when renovations on the 850-year-old church are scheduled to continue.Pressure is growing for the church to be reopened. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has set a strict deadline for 2024, when Paris will host the summer Olympic Games.The 2019 fire, which was likely started by an electrical fault, wiped out the spire and better part of the cathedral’s roof within about an hour. Remarkably, firemen were able to save the stone structure.More than 340,000 donations - totaling nearly €850 million - have been made since then to help with the restoration. Among them, include a combined €300 million donation from French billionaires Francois-Henri Pinault and Bernard Arnault.But reconstruction efforts have been littered with controversy.In July 2020, Mr Macron was forced to drop his suggestion to replace the 19th-century spire, designed by the French architect Viollet-le-Duc, with a “contemporary architectural gesture” following an outcry from purists who argued the cathedral should keep its traditional structure.Then in December 2021, a commission of heritage experts approved a controversial plan to partially modernise the cathedral’s interior as part of the reconstruction, adding contemporary artworks and new lighting effects - much to the chagrin of critics who say the changes will disrupt the traditional design.More from NewsNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe latest news: British aid worker on plane home from IranPolitics latest news: Ukraine will not join Nato \u0026#39any time soon\u0026#39, says Boris Johnson‘Fortress New Zealand’ is no more, as country set to reopen borders after two yearsUkraine-Russia lunchtime briefing: Five developments as dissident TV protester tells countrymen \u0026#39open your eyes to propaganda\u0026#39Met police officers plead not guilty to sharing ‘offensive’ messages with Wayne CouzensMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"fourth round covid vaccinations could start next week slow rollout","story":"The rollout of fourth Covid jabs could start as soon as next week following criticism that NHS planned timescales were too slow. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) last month recommended extra boosters for those aged 75 and over around six months after their last vaccine. But the NHS in England has yet to embark on the fourth rollout, despite the fact it is now six months since the last rollout began. In guidance published last month, NHS England told vaccination services that the rollout was “expected to begin from early April”.Last week The  highlighted concerns that the programme was moving too slowly in England, with Jeremy Hunt, the former Health Secretary, calling for “more oomph on fourth jabs”.The JCVI was also understood to be keen to see England start as soon as is operationally possible.On Tuesday night a health source said: “We expect the rollout of the next set of boosters for the over-75s and those in elderly care homes to start as soon as next week. We are seeing cases increasing amongst the elderly and it’s right that we crack on with it.”They said the timing was not related to recent rises in cases but to ensure the recommendations of the JCVI, which suggest a six-month interval, were followed in England.  Scotland began its rollout more than a week ago, with all over-75s being offered jabs 24 weeks after their last booster.It comes amid rising Covid cases across the UK, with concern that the patterns could reflect waning immunity among those who were the first to receive third doses. Latest figures in England show just 55.5 per cent of over-75s had a booster within the last five months, compared with 68.7 per cent the week before.Those in this age group are expected to start getting texts and letters inviting them for a fourth jab as soon as next week, with booking systems set to open as soon as Monday. NHS officials have always insisted that those eligible for a fourth dose will receive an invitation six months after their last jab, but said most of those in this group would not reach this stage until April. In the last seven days, cases have risen by 52 per cent.However, the Health Secretary has said such increases were to be expected.“We are now open as a country and there’s more social mixing, but there’s nothing in the data at this point in time that gives us any cause for concern,” Sajid Javid told Sky News on Monday. Meanwhile, Covid hospital admissions have risen by 25 per cent.More than half of hospital patients with Covid are “incidental” cases, which means they are more likely to reflect infection rates in the community rather than severe illness.  Scientists have indicated the rise in cases may also reflect the rise of the new BA.2 variant, with some suggestions that it could be more transmissible.Latest data shows vaccine efficacy after a Pfizer booster drops from around 90 per cent to 75 per cent at 10 to 14 weeks. The next set of data due later this week is expected to show how well this holds up at around five months. Last week, Prof Penny Ward, a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, urged health chiefs to “get on with” the rollout of extra boosters.She said England should follow other countries such as Israel which  “swung into action” with its fourth vaccinations.More from NewsNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe latest news: British aid worker on plane home from IranPolitics latest news: Ukraine will not join Nato \u0026#39any time soon\u0026#39, says Boris Johnson‘Fortress New Zealand’ is no more, as country set to reopen borders after two yearsUkraine-Russia lunchtime briefing: Five developments as dissident TV protester tells countrymen \u0026#39open your eyes to propaganda\u0026#39Met police officers plead not guilty to sharing ‘offensive’ messages with Wayne CouzensMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"spare existential angst ineluctable decline west","story":"There we were, two years ago, fretting about the onset of what was already described as a pandemic but which had yet to take a grip. By and large, things were not that bad at all. The racing fraternity had gathered en masse at Cheltenham for the great National Hunt annual meeting, mostly oblivious to the public health calamity that was about to ensue.That event was subsequently seen as a great seeder of Covid, as was Liverpool’s Champions League match with Atlético Madrid around the same time. Back then we called them “super-spreader” episodes because it stood to reason that thousands of people milling together must pass on easily transmissible illnesses.But while that is demonstrably true, the pandemic would have happened even if Cheltenham had been cancelled. The virus was already here, brought in by visitors and skiers returning from the Alpine slopes.Two years ago today we were still a week away from a total lockdown, a delay for which Boris Johnson continues to be lambasted, even though all the evidence shows it made no difference.Britain’s excess fatalities for the period are no worse than most similar countries and yet at the time we were encouraged to believe this was a uniquely British disaster. We were “Plague Island” and yet it turns out that UK the death toll was below average for western Europe.This propensity for doing ourselves down has grown over time. When I was young, the narrative of national exceptionalism was strong. Empire, victory in war and epic tales of great adventurers were celebrated not condemned. Patriotism was a virtue not a sin.Men were men and women were women and no one had any difficulty telling which was which. Over the decades, as prosperity has grown, life s have been extended and we have become used to comfort and plenty, another disease has eaten into the body politic, that of declinism.In Britain, this led to our joining the Common Market in a belief that, without pooling sovereignty with our continental neighbours, we were doomed to perpetual weakness. The establishment was obsessed with the idea of joining this club, even if it meant cutting our close ties with countries with which we had more in common, both culturally and emotionally, such as Australia and Canada.The point is that there is always something to cause anguish and collective heartache, but what is important is to react in a proportionate way. We are currently in an extended bout of dread-filled angst that began with the financial crash of 2008 when it looked like the entire global banking system would fall over.I thought we would be pushing our belongings around some dystopian world in a shopping trolley like the father in Cormac McCarthy’s The Road. It didn’t happen, although we came close.Then came Brexit, which half the country was convinced would lead to economic collapse, a run on the pound, the diminution of the UK as an influential world power and a permanent severing of our links with Europe. None of these happened either, nor were they ever likely to, but exaggeration is another character trait we find hard to avoid.No sooner was Brexit “done”, than news came through from China of a novel coronavirus with the potential to spread rapidly from person to person. Not that the Chinese admitted as much at the time, any more than they were upfront about its provenance, which is increasingly believed to have been a leak from a laboratory in Wuhan.Then, as the pandemic abated and restrictions were finally removed – with February 20 dubbed “Freedom Day” here in England – that ominous noise we could hear from a far-off land was of Vladimir Putin’s tanks rumbling towards Ukraine. Just when it seemed like life was getting back on an even keel, Covid is beginning to look like a walk in the park.Now the worry that keeps us awake at night is not just the plight of the poor Ukrainians or the wider economic consequences of the war, but the renewed threat of Armageddon. The shadow of the nuclear bomb, under which we lived during the Cold War, has returned to cast a pall over all of our lives.A friend said to me the other day that he had never felt so depressed about events, which made me think that, in reality, we had lived through a golden age. Our parents had been bombed in the war and grown up when diseases like polio and diphtheria were still rife. Their fathers had been conscripted to fight in the “war to end all wars’’ which it turned out not to be. If they were shot or otherwise wounded, they had to endure the risk of infection long before the discovery of penicillin.There has hardly been any time in history that has offered as benign an existence as that enjoyed by those of us born in the late 1950s and 1960s into a stable, democratic country like ours. We were not even called up to do National Service, let alone required to fight in a war. This applies not just to Baby Boomers who subsequent generations think got all the breaks. Those born since have had a few, too.Most of us who have grown up since the Second World War have come to expect a steady state of prosperity, stability and contentment beyond the imagination of previous generations. We have lost a sense of historical perspective by overreacting to events precisely because life has, by and large, been good for most people most of the time.The Hobbesian reality is that, for the greater part of man’s existence, wars, famines, pestilence and disaster were the norm just as they still are in some parts of the world. Across Europe and Asia, people happily minding their own business have for centuries suddenly had their worlds snuffed out by Romans or Saxons or Vikings or Normans or Mongols or a succession of Continental armies.In most of Europe it was commonplace to feel that your life was about to be torn apart, your entire savings lost and that a new reality would emerge to take the place of the old. This misery is now being visited upon Ukraine, whose citizens just three weeks ago were looking forward to the arrival of spring.More from NewsNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe latest news: British aid worker on plane home from IranPolitics latest news: Ukraine will not join Nato \u0026#39any time soon\u0026#39, says Boris Johnson‘Fortress New Zealand’ is no more, as country set to reopen borders after two yearsUkraine-Russia lunchtime briefing: Five developments as dissident TV protester tells countrymen \u0026#39open your eyes to propaganda\u0026#39Met police officers plead not guilty to sharing ‘offensive’ messages with Wayne CouzensMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ampleforth colleges future doubt ofsted brands safeguarding","story":"The future of Ampleforth College has been thrown into doubt after it was branded “inadequate” for safeguarding at its most recent inspection.The leading Benedictine school is now urgently putting together an appeal to Ofsted amid fears that parents could remove their children from the institution.The school is also understood to be concerned that the Home Office may refuse to issue visas to overseas pupils, which make up around a fifth of the school\u0027s students.At its most recent Ofsted inspection, Ampleforth College was given the lowest mark for safeguarding but was graded as good for all other categories.  The full report, which will be published on Wednesday by the education watchdog, is the latest setback for the school which has been battling to restore its reputation in the wake of allegations of historic abuse.Last year the school was saved from closure following an intervention from the former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson.Ampleforth College had its ban on admitting new pupils overturned last April after officials at the Department of Education (DfE) said they were satisfied with its safeguarding arrangements.In November 2020, the £36,000-a-year boarding school, based in Yorkshire, was told it must “cease to admit” any more students, with the Education Secretary citing his duty to “safeguard the education and wellbeing of children”.At the time, Mr Williamson ruled that efforts to improve safeguarding in the wake of a child abuse scandal had been “slow and insufficient”.A damning report published by The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse in 2018 found that leaders at Ampleforth in North Yorkshire and Downside hid allegations of appalling abuse against pupils as young as seven to protect the church\u0027s reputation.The two schools which are both linked to Benedictine monasteries were run at times by secretive, evasive and suspicious church officials who avoided reporting misconduct to police and social services, the report said.The inquiry found that sexual abuse ning four decades at both schools was likely to be considerably more widespread than previously thought.Both must implement a “strict separation” between the governance of the abbey and the school, if safeguarding arrangements are to be free from “often conflicting priorities”, the report concluded. Allegations stretching back to the 1960s encompassed a wide spectrum of physical abuse, much of which had sadistic and sexual overtones, it said.Ten iniduals linked to the schools, mainly monks, have been cautioned or convicted over sexual activity or pornography offences involving a large number of children.It was feared that the “restriction order” - which was issued in November and prohibited any new students joining - would spell a death warrant for the 200-year-old school.Last April, DfE officials signed off on an action plan Ampleforth had submitted which set out their “long-term commitment to safeguarding excellence”.  More from NewsPolitics latest news: Ukraine will not join Nato \u0026#39any time soon\u0026#39, says Boris JohnsonNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe latest news: British aid worker on plane home from Iran‘Fortress New Zealand’ is no more, as country set to reopen borders after two yearsUkraine-Russia lunchtime briefing: Five developments as dissident TV protester tells countrymen \u0026#39open your eyes to propaganda\u0026#39Met police officers plead not guilty to sharing ‘offensive’ messages with Wayne CouzensMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch bbc newsreader overwhelmed emotion announcing release","story":"BBC News presenter Joanna Gosling was temporarily overcome with emotion as she announced the news that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is returning to the UK.During the broadcast Ms Gosling was temporarily overwhelmed at the good news.

But despite feeding, walking and smoothing them with affection, sometimes theyaposre more interested in spending time without you.One owner, who is regularly aposditchedapos by her dog when out on walks, has noticed how her golden retriever would rather spend time with stranger than stay by her side.Owner Maggie Daly, from New Jersey, has shared an sweet video of her three-year-old dog loving on complete strangers during their trips to the beach.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. The video has racked in , likes on Instagram and has received hundreds of comments from dog lovers who just canapost get enough of Laylaaposs adorable antics.Maggie said: She does it whenever we go to the beach, which is pretty much everyday. She spots a person or group of people - typically when they are sitting down - and sprints toward them and sits down either right next to them or on their lap. I can usually tell right awaythe person or people are interested in having her invade their space or not andthey are not happy about it I call her back and she - most of the time - will come back or move on to the next group of people.  Most people seem happy about it and will pet her, take pictures with her, throw her ball for her. She will stay with a group for as long as they give her attention and then move on to another group of people. Having been aposloving on strangersapos since she was a puppy, Maggie was anxious about her dogaposs behaviour at first, worried she would be bothering people. I thought I needed to train it out of her but now I realise most people really enjoy her running over to say hi and spread a little love and she also enjoys the extra pets and hugs, she added. A person even commented on the video that her son was one of the people in the video and they had recently lost their golden retriever and he was so happy and thought it was his dog’s way of saying hi. Layla is said to have a larger than le personality and never fails to greet everybody who walks through her door with toys, pillows or blankets. Commenting on the video, one user said: It looked like first guy pulled out his phone to take a selfie and sweet pup leaned in like a pro for the picture. While another added: I hope I am somewhere that you are so I can get hugs. A third said: Your dog shares the love that you give her each day - thataposs a big talent and this is amazing.

It should, but it probably won’t. What is becoming increasingly clear is that the slaughter of innocent civilians by Putin’s military forces guarantees the Kremlin killer will go down in history as a reviled leader who wrecked his own country to destroy another. Because many more will die in a terrible conflict that is all about one man’s vile and foolish quest to build an empire in his honour. The bloodshed is escalating as the war runs out of control, with missiles hitting a base near the Polish border and the fatal shooting of award-winning US filmmaker Brent Renaud. No one knows how this will end but that is no reason for our Government and others not to keep searching for a way to persuade – or force – Putin to withdraw.  Visas shame The great generosity of the British people towards Ukrainian refugees is far more inspiring than Conservative ministers who had to be dragged kicking and screaming every step of the way. It is absolutely shaming that just , visas have been issued when over . million desperate Ukrainians have fled Putin’s terror.  While the bureaucrats continue to put up obstacles, millions are prepared to open their homes to those seeking sanctuary here. The Refugee Council’s concern over the level of support for war victims and Labour’s accusations of foot-dragging reveal the truth about the £-a-month Homes for Ukraine offer. Those arriving require sympathy and help, and genuine fears need to be addressed. Star power Putinaposs growing isolation was again underlined as stars expressed support for Ukraine at last night’s Baftas. Awards are great but Benedict Cumberbatch expressing solidarity with an invaded country reminds us what is really important.

The latest available data from the Department for Education shows % of children - or , pupils - had a reading ability below their expected ability at the end of Key Stage  in . The number of youngsters struggling at the end of primary school had increased, compared to % - or , pupils - the previous year. Official figures, revealed by Schools Minister Robin Walker in a written parliamentary question, show the figure rose to above % in some constituencies such as Leeds Central, Peterborough and Dudley North.Mr Walker said no data was recorded for academic years   or   due to the impact of the COVID- outbreak.The Liberal Democrats said the data laid bare the reading crisis in schools - and warned it could be the tip of the iceberg after children suffered major disruption to their schooling during the pandemic. MPs warned last week that poorer pupils could be up to eight months behind at school after the pandemic and the Governmentaposs catch-up plans are failing to reach them.The Commons Education Committee said repeated school closures had a disastrous impact on childrenaposs education, with disadvantaged kids worst hit by months out of the classroom. Lib Dem education spokesperson Munira Wilson said: These figures reveal a reading crisis in our schools and they’re just the tip of the iceberg. The pandemic has had a huge effect on our children, and with reading ages already below standards for many before the crisis, the case now could be terrible for thousands of children across the country.  “Parents, teachers and pupils have not had a fair deal throughout this pandemic, no child should leave primary school unable to read at the standard level for their age - they need a chance to catch up. The party called for an urgent review into reading standards across the country and for ministers to pump more cash into catch-up programmes. The Government has announced £ billion in funding to help children catch up on lost learning over the pandemic - which has been criticised for falling short of the £ billion demanded by Boris Johnsonaposs education recovery tsar Sir Kevan Collins. A Department for Education spokesperson said: We are committed to raising literacy standards and our ambitious recovery plan is helping pupils make up for learning lost during the pandemic. Backed by £ billion, we are rolling out high-quality tutoring – which has seen a million courses started by pupils so far – alongside world class training for teachers and early years practitioners, and additional funding for schools.

But the PM was heading this morning to Riyadh to beg bin Salman to increase oil production to help the West wean itself off Russian energy. Early this morning he was making similar pleas to Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed in the neighbouring UAE, also guilty of human rights abuses. Mr Johnson said: “The UK is building an international coalition to deal with the new reality we face.Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here “The world must wean itself off Russian hydrocarbons and starve Putin’s addiction to oil and gas. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are key international partners in that.”Pressed on whether the sht away from Russia meant dealing with other dangerous regimes, he said: “We want to build the widest possible coalition.”But Labour leader Keir Starmer blasted: “Going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is not an energy strategy.Saying we are not going to rely on Russia and then going to Saudi Arabia is not an energy strategy.” Boris Johnson today insisted that forging closer ties with Saudi Arabia does not mean we canapost stick to our principles”.  He pointed towards Saudi Arabia announcing a £ billion investment in green aviation fuel in Teesside. Thataposs the kind of thing we want to encourage - doesnapost in any way mean we canapost stick to our principles and raise those issues that we all care about, he told broadcasters at the Emirates Palace hotel in Abu Dhabi. But he appeared pessimistic that he will be able to open up the spare capacity of the Saudi-led Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countriesto soften the blow of esting from Russian fossil fuels. Itaposs not just a question of looking at the Opec countries and what they can do to increase supply, though that is important. Thereaposs also the issue of Emirati investment in UK wind farms, already huge what more can they do  he said. When we look at the dependency the West in particular has built up on Putinaposs hydrocarbons, on Putinaposs oil and gas, we can see what a mistake that was because heaposs been able to blackmail the West and hold western economies to ransom. We need independence. Ed Miliband, Shadow Secretary of State for Climate and Net Zero, said: “It is a sign of our vulnerability and energy insecurity as a country that the Prime Minister is going to Saudi Arabia to seek an increase in oil production, despite the appalling human rights record.”Polly Truscott, of Amnesty International UK, said: “Saudi oil shouldn’t be allowed to buy the world’s silence over Saudi’s terrible human rights record.” Mike Davis, of Global Witness, said: “Oil and gas drives conflict. Rather than run, cap in hand, to Riyadh, the PM should be focusing on how we can rapidly invest in renewable energy.” Conservative Julian Lewis, who chairs the Intelligence and Security Committee, called for assurances that the UK would not now become dependent on another “unreliable, sometimes hostile, regime”.  Katie Fallon of the Campaign Against Arms Trade said Britain’s weapons sales to Saudi had “emboldened” the kingdom to “commit violations” of humanitarian law in Yemen. Mr Johnson, who will travel overnight before starting in the UAE, wrote in thetoday: “As long as the West is economically dependent on Putin, he will do all he can to exploit that dependence... And that is why that dependence must – and will - now end.”Tory MPs today urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to combat “eye-watering” fuel costs by cutting duty.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartySheikh Mohammed bin ZayedBoris JohnsonEd MilibandJulian LewisHuman rightsPoliticsRussia Ukraine warDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Days later, he oversaw the largest mass execution in the country’s history. He is betting countries like the UK will look away, because they would rather fund his blood-soaked petro-state than Putin’s war machine. It is not an either or. There are better and more sustainable ways to deal with the energy crisis than empowering these regimes. By visiting Saudi Arabia, Johnson will confirm that the Kingdom will face no meaningful consequences for this mass execution. It virtually guarantees more people whose only crime was to protest against Bin Salman’s rule will be executed. People like Hassan al Maliki, an academic currently facing a death sentence for owning banned books.  The  executions at the weekend were probably beheadings, but Saudi ‘justice’ is such a black box we can’t be sure. The European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, which tracks death sentences in Saudi Arabia, didn’t even know about  of the cases. These men were tried, convicted, sentenced and executed in complete secrecy.Of the  we do know about, at least three were tortured into making  confessions to terrorism offences after taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations. Aqil al-Faraj was held in solitary confinement, beaten all over his body and tortured with electricity and cigarette burns. He was imprisoned for five years, without access to a lawyer, before trial. This is the reality of Saudi capital punishment. The authorities label executed men ‘terrorists’ but there are political prisoners, non-violent drug offenders, and people arrested as children on death row. In , the UK and Saudi governments signed a top secret ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ on judicial co-operation. Since this agreement has been in place, the Saudi regime led by King Salman and his son has dramatically increased the pace of executions – there have been more than  in all. Ministers claim the UK is a restraining influence, but the Saudis don’t seem to have noticed.Visiting Riyadh so soon after this mass execution shames the Prime Minister and shames Britain.

Courtney Rogers, , from New Mexico in the US, and her pastor husband Chris, , welcomed lb oz Cambria into the world on  March, bringing their total kids to the magic number . The parents say they never intended to have so many kids when they first decided to start a family, and even suffered a miscarriage when they first started trying - but now their brood is perfect. Their eldest son, Clint, was born on  March  before the couple went on to have another five boys, followed by six girls. It is amazing how it worked out too because we had all our boys at the beginning and the last five have been girls, so it all evened out, Courtney said.  Clint was born three weeks before I turned  but, back then, I had no clue that I would have more children. I thought I was too old at  and I didnapost know they would come so fast, plus include a set of twins. Then we said we would have  children maximum, but I still felt young and healthy enough, so we pushed it to . Clint, , Clay, , Cade, nine, Callie, eight, Cash, seven, twins Colt and Case, six, Calena, four, Caydie, three, Coralee, two, Caris, one, and now newborn baby Cambria. Asthe kids werenapost enough to run around after, they also live on a farm with more than  animals including pigs, sheep and chickens. The family is now relieved to have little Cambria home after she spent the first few days of her le on oxygen after being delivered via C-section.  The tot swallowed too much fluid and had to be monitored for several days. While Courtney and Chris had an agonising wait for news on Cambriaaposs condition they were reminded of the frightening birth of their second-youngest, Caris, who was delivered via emergency C-section when doctors feared she wasnapost getting enough oxygen. Now with  children aged  and under, Courtney and Chris are getting stuck into family planning to manage the bunch. Since first becoming a mum  years ago, the longest Courtney has gone without being pregnant is seven months. The biggest gap between two of the children is  months, during which time Courtney sadly had a miscarriage. She said: It is going to be strange not to have another baby. Pregnancy mostly treated me well, I didnapost get sick and was never on bedrest, so I could always look after the kids. I have enjoyed having babies. While managing so many kids, Courtney can spot their little personalities coming out as they get older. She said: The little girls know they are the youngest because they try to get away with everything. Without any more kids planned, the parents are now turning their attention to some home improvements - including an extension on their four-bedroom house to create seven bedrooms. It will also give Courtney more time to focus on the weekly shop, which includes  disposable nappies , six loaves of bread and  gallons of milk. Courtney says the kids, who are homeschooled, are all incredibly close and like to pal up with each other. She said: We do everything together. We work together and do home-schooling together. When they are younger I help the children with all their schooling, but when they are older - from the age of  - we switch to online tuition.  A typical day in the Rogers household involves breakfast at am, before lessons in maths and art. Lunch tends to be around .am-pm when Courtney will feed the little ones sandwiches and put them down for a nap, while the older kids make their own food. In the afternoon, the kids have an assortment of language classes, arts, and reading time, with Zoom piano lessons thrown in once in a while. Dinner is served at pm which is usually a meal that has been batch-cooked by Courtney, such as spaghetti or homemade pancakes. A typical mealtime will see the family get through  eggs, while a whole box of cereal is used up at breakfast every day. In between teaching the kids, Courtney also takes responsibility for keeping the house tidy, before she puts them down to bed at .pm.  Courtney documents her family le on her Instagram page, @littlehouseinthehighdesert, where she has nearly , followers.However, having such a big  has opened her up to some nasty trolling from people who object to her having so many children. She said: People we know donapost say anything to our faces, but there are always those on the internet who have something mean to say. She added: I do find it hard sometimes, as most people think we are crazy for having so many, but I have several friends on the internet with big families.

After she stopped taking the contraceptive pill, the pair hoped nature would take its course and Diana would soon fall pregnant. Before long, they got their wish and Diana, now , discovered she was expecting a baby. But tragically, she miscarried. The following year in , Diana was once again hopeful after falling pregnant for a second time, but suffered heartbreak again when she lost the baby. From the minute she stopped taking the pill, the hopeful mum realised something wasn’t right - and she went to the doctor with her concerns. “I’ve always had painful periods since I was a teenager. I went to see doctors but I was told, ‘some women get painful periods’,” she told The Mirror. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here “I used to get very sharp pains in my lower abdomen but I noticed it wasn’t only during the days I was on my period - also at random times, mid-cycle.” Diana was told she was experiencing “ovulation pain” that would go away when she got pregnant - but until then, she should take the pill to manage it. When the pair decided to try for a baby and Diana stopped taking the pill, she says the pain came back. “I had pain passing stools and urine, I was bloated and was generally feeling unwell,” she said. Diana claims she went back to the doctor complaining of sharp pains in her abdomen and was just given antibiotics. But after two miscarriages, she was sure something more serious was wrong and was eventually sent to see a gynaecologist.  “An ultrasound scan showed cysts on my oies, fibroids and suspected endometriosis,” she said. Fibroids are non-cancerous growths that develop in and around the womb, and are thought to be more common in Black women. Endometriosis is a condition where the lining of the womb begins to grow in other places such as the oies or fallopian tubes. It can cause signicant pain and can result in dficulty getting pregnant. After a laparoscopy, it was confirmed Diana had endometriosis - and the lining of her womb was growing in her bladder, bowels, appendix and colon. “It was very scary,” Diana said.  “But I was relieved to finally have a reason for the stabbing pain that I had been having.” Diana and Moses kept trying for a baby, but they had no luck. Eventually their doctor referred the couple for fertility treatment and they began the process of IVF. However, due to Diana’s endometriosis, she also had to have several operations, including a myomectomy to remove the fibroids and womb lining. “The operations were to remove the endometriosis, resection of fibroids, removing the scarring caused by the endometriosis and unsticking the tubes which have been blocked by the endometriosis,” Diana explained. She added that during one operation, surgeons had even removed her appendix because there were signs of endometriosis there. Despite having to have more operations than she can count, Diana says she’s grateful for her “brilliant” doctors at Basingstoke Hospital, as well as her consultant at TFP Wessex Fertility, part of the TFP Fertility Group, one of the UK and EU’s leading fertility clinics.Read More While going through the physical toll of the operations, Diana also suffered three more miscarriages during her IVF journey. Determined not to give up, she and Moses tried again. But after Diana had her eggs collected on her last cycle, she realised something wasn’t right. “I was feeling very bloated and sore, I was in so much pain,” Diana said. “By the second night I was feeling so poorly and could hardly move. I hadn’t been passing much urine even though I’d been drinking a lot. “In the middle of the night I was struggling to breathe so I phoned an on-call doctor.” After speaking to the doctor, Diana was sent to the women’s ward. By now she was in so much pain she was “gasping for air.”  “They wheeled me straight in for an X-ray where they discovered I had lots of fluid in my lungs. “Back at the ward, I was surrounded by lots of doctors and they gave me an oxygen tube to help me breathe and strong pain medication.” Doctors told Diana she had oian hyperstimulation syndrome . OHSS is more likely to occur in women having IVF after taking hormones to stimulate egg production. It causes the oies to swell with eggs, which can be incredibly painful and cause blood clots. In rare, severe cases, it can be fatal. Feeling delirious from the painkillers, Diana said she didn’t understand how serious her condition was when doctors took her to intensive care. But she does remember seeing the results of her X-ray - which showed her right lung was submerged in fluid.  Doctors inserted a tube into Diana’s lung to drain the fluid, and thankfully she was allowed to leave intensive care three days later. After being sent home to recover from OHSS, Diana waited a few months before having embryos transferred into her womb in February .By March, she took a pregnancy test that came back positive.“I was excited but still apprehensive due to the previous miscarriages,” Diana said. She added she was also nervous because, throughout the pregnancy, the sharp pains in her abdomen never went away - despite what she’d been told by doctors in the past. She said: “Week by week as I had my scans, I was reassured that despite the pain I was having, the baby was ok. “First, we saw the sac on the ultrasound, and then the flickering heartbeat.” But when she finally reached the  week mark, Diana said she cried “tears of joy.” After a painful pregnancy during which Diana had to be scanned every fortnight, the couple welcomed their daughter Siimainto the world on the st November , and after nearly a decade of trying, the pair were finally parents. “I say this over and over again - I would go through all the surgeries, the pricks and the pain to have our beautul daughter,” Diana said. “She has a beautul personality and brings us so much joy. I think I’d be lost without her.” Despite her baby joy, Diana still lives with intense pain from endometriosis, which she believes has worsened since she gave birth. She is even considering a hysterectomy as she’s “tired of living with pain” which affects all aspects of her le. “Not only does it affect me physically, but also my lestyle and relationships with my friends and family,” she said. “PerhapsI was diagnosed earlier it would have been a dferent story. “The doctors were helpful but I think we need a lot more research and conversation so that women’s pain isn’t dismissed as ‘just period pain’.”Do you have a story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PregnancyMiscarriageIVFFertilityPeriods\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

So, when the Palace announced the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were expecting their second child in , people couldnapost wait to find out more.During Kateaposs pregnancy, in which she suffered from severe sickness, there was huge speculation over the gender of the second senior royal baby - and what the child would be called. Many royal fans were also curious to know what the royal baby might look like, with some even going as far as using prediction websites to get an idea of how Princess Charlotte would look and the results were... a little creepy. The prediction site allows users to upload photos of both the mum and dad, which it uses to create a bizarre mash-up of how the child may look. Someone did exactly that, by using photos of Kate and Prince William to guess how Charlotte would look, and on reflection, the predictions were very, very wrong. In just two months, young Charlotte will celebrate her seventh birthday but sheaposs already become a firm favourite among royal fans. Born on May , , Charlotte made history when her brother Prince Louis was born as she became the first woman in history to keep her place in the line of succession despite having a younger male sibling. She might only be six, but the Princess is often described as the most outspoken and determined of all of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs children, with Kate previously joking she was the boss of their household. Royal expert Katie Nicholl previously told the Mirror: Charlotte is the most buoyant and outgoing of the three Cambridge children.

Gavin lives in the top floor flat in Glenburn with we Cherine, -year-old daughter Elisha, three-year-old Freya and Arya, who’s one, and has been left angered by being bounced around by Scottish Water and Renfrewshire Council, who are both investigating the source of the problem, the Daily Record reports.He said: “We’ve had problems with the water since October last year but it properly stopped two weeks ago.  “I’ve been phoning Renfrewshire Council and Scottish Water every day, I keep being bounced between the two of them. It feels like no-one is taking any interest. “We can’t wash our clothes or our dishes or ourselves. We were going to my in-laws and my family to wash but they’ve both got Covid now so we’re stuck. “We paid out of our own pocket to stay at the Glenfer Hotel but we can’t afford to keep doing that.” The issue has been made more complex by the fact Gavinaposs flat is privately owned, while the flats below are council-owned.  If the source of the water problem is in the garden then it falls to Renfrewshire Council to fix it. If it’s in the street, then it’s down to Scottish Water. The dad-of-three, who says he reported the issue on February , added: “I’ve got a stoma bag which I need to keep clean. We need to make bottles for our youngest. “They should be paying for us to stay in a local hotel. I shouldn’t have to be chasing them to find out what’s happening. “There are five of us in our flat, it’s utter bedlam.”A spokesperson for Renfrewshire Council said: “Investigations have been carried out in conjunction with Scottish Water since the issue was first identied.“We have now identied the source of a water leak, and this will be fixed as soon as possible.” A spokesperson for Scottish Water confirmed the issue was not with the public water system. He said: “In response to reports of issues affecting the water supply to Mr Divers’ home, our local team has attended and investigated. “On each occasion, we have confirmed that there are no issues affecting the public water network that Scottish Water maintains. “We have been liaising with Renfrewshire Council and with Mr Divers to inform them of our findings and provide advice. “In an effort to help in the interim, we have provided a supply of bottled water this week on a goodwill basis.

But after about five minutes or so she started to drt in and out of consciousness. Her colour left her and she was incredibly pale. At that point, I said that we should ring an ambulance as Penny had a wee bit of history of having febrile convulsions. While we were waiting for an ambulance I was comforting and reassuring Larissa and kept encouraging Penny to open her eyes and aposlook at thisapos just to make sure she was still alert and responding to voices. It was an eventful afternoon and it was so nice to hear that Penny got home that night and was doing okay. It was a huge relief. Store manager Martin Green added: We are all very proud of them.

As part of the show, he explained to viewers how they could receive cash by taking advantage of marriage tax allowance.Martin explained that the marriage tax allowance allows you to transfer £, of your personal allowanceto your spouse or civil partner,they earn more than you. One viewer investigatedshe could benefit from this advice and made a phone call which ended up with her receiving an £ windfall.  She tweeted to Martin: After watching your programme last night on marriage allowance, I rang up today and £ cheque is in the post … thank you for all that you do, we are lucky to have someone like you. What is the marriage allowance  The marriage allowance allows you to transfer £, of your personal allowanceto your spouse or civil partner,they earn more than you.If your claim is successful, it will lower the higher earneraposs tax bill for the tax year, but you can also backdate your claimeligible. Only people with specic circumstances will be able to apply, says WalesOnline. You need to be married or in a civil partnership, not just living together. One of you needs to be a non-taxpayer, which usually means youaposll earn less than the £, personal allowance between April ,  and April , . The other partner needs to be a basic % rate taxpayer and you both must have been born on or after April , . If that like you, get on the phone and you could be quids in.

I tried, I really tried, but I think that what that does internally is probably really damaging.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here But Royal correspondent and author Katie Nicholl said the coupleaposs determination to go it alone is proof of their love and solidarity as a couple. The couple spoke about the pressures of working as full-time royals in a tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey last year. The highly anticipated interview saw the couple lt the lid on le behind Palace walls and make several shocking allegations about their family.  They shared that there had been concerns over the colour of their son Archieaposs skin and said Prince Charles had stopped taking Harryaposs phone calls. They also revealed they secretly got married before their royal wedding, and that they are expecting a daughter in the summer. Katie told OK!: “In only four years they’ve been on an extraordinary journey, making such huge decisions. But as Harry said, they are in it together, as a team,” adds Katie. “When you think about what they’ve turned their backs on, what they’ve given up and particularly the sacrices Harry has made, it’s just as well they’re such a strong unit because they’ve only really got each other. Meghan’s only family connections are with her mother Doria, and Harry’s ties with his family are hanging by a thread.” Royal author Nigel Cawthorne agreed, saying Harry and Meghanaposs solitude may have strengthened them as a couple.  “It’s Harry and Meghan against the world or them against the British establishment,” he said. “But when couples go through a shared problem, it does tend to make them stronger.” While many believe the key to any reconciliation with the royals could lie in their children Archie and baby Lilibet, born in June last year, that still seems a way off for now. Faced with a choice between love and duty, Harry and Meghan resoundingly chose love.

Just under a year before they were married, the couple made their first-ever official appearance together at the Games in Toronto, where Meghan was living filming hit TV show Suits.They popped along to a tennis event in the Canadian city with Meghan making a very intriguing outfit choice. She teamed a pair of ripped blue jeans and ballet pumps with a crisp white shirt designed by her friend Misha Nonoo. And the  shirt set tongues wagging after it emerged the name of the piece was called the aposhusbandapos shirt.  At the time, Meghan and Harry werenapost engaged and many wonderedthe shirt was a way of signalling what was to come. The Daily Mail even noted it was perhaps a subtle indication by Meghan that she won’t be a single lady for much longer.During their appearance, the happy couple held hands as they walked towards the court and smiled and exchanged small talk with each other.

The pair were said to be delighted with their first public appearance, which made headlines across the world. A royal source said at the time: It was a calm fun atmosphere for the competitors and their families which was the most important thing.  And just several months later, Harry and Meghan announced their engagement to the world before marrying at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor in May . Since then, the pair have been working royals, quit the Firm, welcomed two children and now live in Calornia.Last week it was revealed that Harry would be travelling to the Netherlands next month for the  Invictus Games in The Hague - just hours after news he won’t be attending his grandfather’s memorial service broke.A video posted on social media shows Harry trying to learn the Dutch language whilst wearing an entirely orange outfit. The video came a day after it was confirmed that Harry would miss his late grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh’s memorial service later this month.On Friday, a spokesperson for the Duke of Edinburgh said Harry will notto the UK from the US to join the Royal Family at the high-profile occasion in Westminster Abbey on March .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Harley and Harry were conceived through IVF and were born at just  weeks and five days.Parents Jade and Steve Crane had been warned by doctors it could be a miscarriage as the tiny tots were so young, telling them to “prepare to say goodbye”.But when they were born they showed signs of le so the team burst into action.Now, after  days of intensive care, the brother and sister have been allowed to go home, the Liverpool Echo reports.Former mental health nurse Jade said: Iaposm so proud of my babies - theyaposre little fighters. “Theyaposre doing absolutely amazing. Theyaposre doing all the things that we were told they wouldnapost do - theyaposre crying, theyaposre surviving.  The doctors were saying the babies wouldnapost survive at this gestation. I was still two weeks away from what the UK classes as viable and the babies were given a zero per cent chance of survival. “It was only because I was at a teaching hospital and that the babies were born with signs of le that they chose to intervene medically.”The couple underwent eight cycles of IVF over  years as they tried to start their family, tragically suffering three miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy before the twins’ arrival.Jade discovered she had an overactive immune system, causing her body to reject the pregnancies before the couple moved from a fertility clinic in Nottingham to one on Harley Street in London.Jade was prescribed several types of medication in order to combat her immune system problems. Jade added: On our eighth cycle of IVF, we had two embryos transferred which both worked and we ended up with boy and girl twins. “I couldnapost let myself believe it, I was so fearful of a miscarriage or something going wrong. I was still in disbelief when we got to  weeks, and I hadnapost even hit my third trimester when I went into labour so we hadnapost bought anything. “The few bits of clothes that I did buy made me think that I better keep the tags on just in case - you just donapost want to let yourself believe. The couple checked in at Queens Medical Hospital in Nottingham on October  when Jade leaked fluid at home for several days at  weeks.  The babies were not considered to be viable and the poor mum believed she would lose her precious twins. She added: The doctor kept saying it was a miscarriage but I said it couldnapost be because I could feel the babies moving. I knew they were ok but was being told they wouldnapost survive at this gestation. It was only because the babies were born with signs of le that they chose to intervene medically. They were alive, moving around, and they cried. Their little cries sounded like a tiny kitten.” The tiny children were finally allowed home on Monday- just two weeks after their initial due date. Steve added: The absolutely stunning doctors, nurses and surgeons have all been part of the making of this moment. “Itaposs hard to say goodbye to them but I hope I never see them again.

Later, Laura stepped in to be a surrogate mum for EmmaEmma Smuts-Muller and her best friend Laura DonohoeByNatasha Wynarczyk:,  Mar |commentsOver the course of their -year friendship, Emma Smuts-Muller and Laura Donohoe have been there for each other through thick and thin.But now the pair share an even more special bond, after caring Laura stepped in to be a surrogate mother for her best friend - after being bridesmaid for her just months earlier. Emma saw her hopes of conceiving dashed after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in September  and had to undergo treatment which affected her fertility.But thanks to Laura, Emma is now the proud mum of miracle baby Ella and is looking forward to a bright future.“Laura and I have always had an amazing connection with each other since we met at school,” says -year-old Emma, who lives near Birmingham and works as a chief of staff for West Midlands Police. “My husband Thomas and I had realised just how ready we were to have a baby, but after having breast cancer that decision was taken away from us. I will never be able to repay Laura for what she’s done for my family and it’s brought us even closer together.” In May , Emma married Thomas, , with Laura, , by their side as a bridesmaid. Soon after ing from their honeymoon in Lake Como, Emma was delighted to discover that she was pregnant, but tragically miscarried just eight weeks later. The couple were dealt another blow when Emma’s father Terry was diagnosed with leukaemia, then, that September Emma found a mass in her right breast. Scans quickly confirmed the diagnosis of breast cancer.  “I’d had some soreness that I’d initially put down to being pregnant, but when I noticed the changes in my breast I had an instant gut feeling that it was something bad,” Emma recalls. “Thomas and I had been on a massive high after the wedding, and to get pregnant so quickly it felt like everything was going to plan, but to be dealt so many devastating problems one after the other was really dficult for our family. “I just felt myself go into fight mode. I tried to not think too far into the future because it would have been too overwhelming. I knew I had no option but to get on with le.” Emma underwent eight cycles of chemotherapy which started in November . The following April, Emma had a mastectomy which removed her right breast as well as the cm cancerous tumour, then she went on to have two weeks of radiotherapy. Desperate to become a parent, Emma had been told by doctors that the chemotherapy could affect her fertility so she’d been offered IVF before starting her cancer treatment. However, despite successfully freezing  embryos it became clear that it wouldn’t be an option for Emma to carry one of them herself.  Emma says: “Because my breast cancer was linked to hormones, I had oian supression treatment. I was also told I need to take tamoxen - which I am on for  years - to stop the cancer ing. Due to the previous treatment, and the fact tamoxen stops your oies working, I began to go into the menopause. “Doctors also don’t allow you to get pregnant on tamoxen, and due to my age, I would have potentially been too old to carry my own child once I stopped taking the medication.” Emma and Thomas began to explore the possibility of using a surrogate to conceive, then one night Laura, who has two daughters aged seven and  with her husband Rob, came over to their house and told them she would be willing to carry their child. “She just dropped it out there that she would consider being our surrogate, which took us both massively by surprise,” says Emma.“However, due to the coronavirus pandemic the plans were put on hold for a few months, and despite having such a long time to mull it over she didn’t change her mind. I was so grateful to her.”In February , Laura was implanted with one of Emma and Thomas’s embryos. The trio then had a nail-biting two-week wait until Laura could do a pregnancy test.“When she sent the picture of the positive test through, we were so shocked - but really delighted,” says Emma. “We did this part of the fertility treatment with a private clinic but the doctors there told us there was only a % chance of it working due partly to my age and us using a surrogate, so I had prepared for the worst.” On November , Ella was born with Emma by Laura’s side as she went through labour. “Ella was  days overdue, so she did keep us waiting - however, she was definitely worth the wait,” says Emma. “Laura was very clear with her own children that she was just helping myself and Thomas out, and they really understood that. “I never had any worries that Laura would bond with Ella and find it dficult to give her over to us. “We don’t know yet when we will tell Ella how she was born, but it’s such a positive experience however we describe it. Most of all, we want her to understand what a miracle she is.” Now, Emma will have a yearly mammogram and speaks to her oncologist every six weeks to make sure the cancer hasn’t ed. Most of all, she is enjoying being a mum. She adds: “After coming through such a dficult time, Thomas and I finally have something positive to focus on. Laura is an incredible human being for carrying Ella for us.” Breast Cancer Now support and fund research into the condition.

The decision is said to have come before the Russian invasion of Ukraine but at the time when troops had been amassing on the border. A spokesperson for the Queen’s Collection told the newspaper: “A decision to postpone a loan of three swords from the Royal Collection to the Kremlin Museums in Moscow was made in mid-February.”The Royal Collection Trust is said to be among several institutions that have withdrawn their permission for some of their items to go on display in the exhibition, which was being sponsored by Alisher Usmanov - a Russian oligarch, who is subject to sanctions in the UK and US.The institutions are said to include the Royal Armouries based in Leeds as well as the Louvre in Paris and Madrid’s Prado Museum.

The website says : The Moscow Kremlin Museums report the postponement of the exhibition The Duel: from Trial by Combat to a Noble Crime, which was scheduled to open on  March .The core of the project consists of exhibits from European museums, which were forced to withdraw them before the time due to the geopolitical situation. The Moscow Kremlin Museums are currently working on making the exhibition happen without European participation, and express their sincere thanks to the Russian museum community for offering assistance in the current dficult circumstances. The Mirror has contacted the Royal Collection Trust for comment. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Queen has yet to speak publicly on the issue.However, when she met Canadian president Justin Trudeau at Windsor Castle last week, a vase full of blue and yellow flowers was on display.

The first  models of the new design have already been wired up and will be rolled out wherever possible in England and Wales. It marks the first time a new style has been implemented since . The new models are intended to minimise visual impact on the environment, and were submitted by Danish company Bystrup.

The new models stand at m- around a third the size of other high voltage pylons - and boast a smaller ground footprint. A kmroute has been set up between Bridgwater and Portbury, Somerset, that will carry low-carbon electricity.  A National Grid spokesperson said the route will connect the Hinkley Point C Nuclear power station to six million homes and businesses They also confirmed the electricity supply is due to be turned on in October.  of the old style pylons, formerly known as transmission towers are expected to be moved as part of the project. These original pylons - named for the Greek word pyle, meaning gateway, were reminiscent of the doors on either side of Egyptian temples, hence their obelisk-like name. Over , pylons are situated in England and Wales - and they cover more than , miles. Pylons are built incredibly tall so as to avoid roads, rivers, and railway lines - and to ensure nothing comes too close to them. The cables on pylons are uninsulated and pose a great risk of electric shock, however, birds are not electrocuted since they are not in contact with the ground, so the electricity stays in the power line.

Each of the  towns and cities with the highest infection rates are in Scotland, with Na h-Eileanan Siar recording a rate of ,. cases per , people - two-and-a-half times the rate in Englandaposs worst hotspot. Today First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament: The increase in cases over the past three weeks has been driven by the BA. sub-lineage of the Omicron iant, which is estimated to be signicantly more transmissible - with a growth rate since mid-February perhaps % greater than original Omicron. BA. is now our dominant strain, accounting for more than % of all reported cases.  BA. has become dominant in Scotland earlier than in England and Wales, hence the more rapid increase in cases here than south of the border in recent weeks - although cases and hospital admissions are now rising sharply again in England too. Department of Health data shows , people were in hospital with the virus on Monday, of which  were in ventilation beds.

Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that the legal requirement for businesses to keep customersapos details in case these are needed for contact tracing will end as planned on Monday, March . But speaking about requirements on the wearing of face coverings, she said: Given the current spike in case numbers, we consider it prudent to retain this requirement in regulation for a further short period. The First Minister added: Ensuring continued widespread use of face coverings will provide some additional protection - particularly for the most vulnerable - at a time when the risk of infection is very high, and it may help us get over this spike more quickly. The legal requirement will be reviewed again in two weeksapos time, she added, with Ms Sturgeon saying the expectation was that it will become guidance rather than the law in early April. She went on to tell MSPs that advice on testing would also change next month, saying that from April  we will no longer advise people without symptoms to test twice-weekly.

The dust cloud, which is km above ground level, could fall during showers in the southern parts of Britain on Wednesday afternoon , the Met Office has predicted. Parts of Spain have already been blanketed in a thick plume - and live photos show skies turning orange in London, Kent today. In East Sussex, residents have been pictured wiping layers of orange dust off their cars. The sand - driven up high into the atmosphere by desert storms - is currently wreaking havoc over Spain, but will soon be on its way to Leicestershire today. Images captured by satellites have also shown dust over France. Forecasters say the impact is “unlikely” to be signicant, with the dust potentially most visible at sunset. Are you experiencing orange sky or blood rain where you live  Contact us at webnews@mirror with your photos The storm is unlikely to cause the same level of issues it has been in the Iberian Peninsula, where people have been advised to stay indoors.Weather forecaster Phil Morrish, from Rothley, has been keeping a keen eye on the atmospheric conditions from his Mountsorrel weather station.He revealed that the dust cloud will soon be moving northwards to the UK, on the coattails of a warm front.  Speaking yesterday, he said: Itaposs been a nice day across Leicestershire today - pretty sunny with up to six hours of continuous sunshine and a high of about C. Tomorrow, however, is going to be a bit damper with some rain, but not all day. It will be colder, with a maximum temperature of about C but it should be back up to about C on Thursday and Friday when there will be a lot more sunshine once again. Weaposve had some high-pressure conditions for the last few days, hence the fine weather. But there will be a warm front moving up from the south tomorrow. And whataposs interesting about it is itaposs likely to bring with it some sand all the way from the Sahara. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Richard Miles, of the Met Office, told the PA news agency: “Storm Celia over Spain is indeed pulling a dust cloud up from the Sahara, which could potentially reach as far as the south of the UK.“However, we don’t expect signicant impacts – the most likely would be on the cloudscapes at sunset, but as conditions are likely to be generally overcast and wet for much of the day this is unlikely to amount to much. There are no air quality warnings. “People in the south might find a bit of dust left on their cars as the rain washes it out of the skies today.” BBC weather presenter Carol Kirkwood warned: There has been very poor air quality today in parts of Spain, and it could well affect us in the southeast and East Anglia on Wednesday.  Dr Andy Whittamore - the clinical lead at Asthma UK - has previously warned of the dangers posed by Saharan dust clouds over the country. He said it can cause coughing and wheezing in many sufferers - or even a full-on asthma attack. Toxic air can leave people struggling for breath and can cause wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and even a le-threatening asthma attack, he said.Saharan dust could pose a serious risk to the . million people in the UK with asthma. Dust and other types of air pollution are a well-known trigger for people with asthma.People with asthma must make sure they carry their reliever inhalerwith them at all times in case their symptoms worsen. He added: We also advise people with asthma to continue to manage their condition with their preventer inhaler . This will help to reduce the inflammation in their airways and make them less likely to react to asthma triggers.  Wednesday is expected to be cloudy for most of England, Wales and eastern Scotland with rain becoming heavier and more widespread later in the day in central and eastern areas. Rain in England will then begin to clear as many regions turn cold, with patchy frost and some rural mist, the Met Office has said. Showers, frost and fog will continue to hit parts of the UK for the rest of the week.

Looking further ahead, it could be a hot spring with weather forecaster Jim Dale reportedly saying that it could get up to C by the middle of April. And bookies are cutting the odds on it being the hottest spring on record. With temperatures on the up, Ladbrokes have slashed odds in half from   to just   on this going down as the hottest spring ever.  Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: Spring is just around the corner and as things stand weaposre well on course for a record-breaking scorcher,the latest odds are anything to go by.”For this week it will be quite pleasant said BBC Weatheraposs Tomasz Schafernaker with sunshine and dry weather.“In the south where the winds will be light the temperatures will be around the mid-teens. Then Thursday and Friday the high pressure establishes itself across the UK, in fact a big high pressure spreading all the way from Eastern Europe to the edge of Ireland so a lot of settled weather, said Mr Schafernaker. You can see the winds blowing around the high here. Northern and western parts of the country right in the middle of that high where the weather will be sunniest, the winds will be lightest and as a result will have the highest temperatures around C or C.  And that high pressure is expected to persist Friday, Saturday and into Sunday as well although it will be a little breezy at times. Mr Schafernaker continued: Highest temperatures will be C for example Liverpool but on the coast of Cornwall and Devon it could only be about C. Then Saturday into Sunday that high pressure still with us. The winds will change direction a little around the high, they will be coming more out of the south and south east that generally means a lot of dry weather, fairly decent temperatures. UK forecast for the next  days Wet for many today but sunnier on Thursday. Today: Cloudy for most of England, Wales and eastern Scotland rain at times, becoming heavier and more widespread later for central and eastern England. Brighter in northwest UK with some showers, brighter weather edging into other northern and western areas later. Tonight: Rain in eastern England clearing, then many areas turning clear and cold, with patchy frost and some rural mist. Showers in northwest UK easing, but turning wetter and windier later. Thursday: Many areas starting chilly, fine conditions lasting most of Thursday in southern and eastern England. Rain and brisk winds in the northwest spreading to central areas, followed by blustery showers Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Showers in the far north clear early Friday. Some night frost and fog where, but then all areas dry and increasingly sunny. Perhaps cloudier with a few showers Sunday.

DM  Co. Homes, based in the West Midlands has caused a stir on TikTok after saying that people who purchase a Greggs breakfast every morning could have saved just under £, for a house deposit instead. In a clip, they warned that buying from the bakery five days a week adds up and could set you back a whopping £, over five years - which is enough for a % deposit on a £k property.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.The video has since gone viral, garnering over , views and thousands of likes. Text on the clip reads: You spend £ at Greggs every morning. Thataposs £ a week. Thataposs £ a month. Thataposs £, a year. Three years later thataposs £,. Five years later thataposs £,. You couldaposve added that to your deposit on a property. The estate agents captioned the video writing: Whoaposs guilty   Many fellow TikTok users were left fuming by the post, branding it pointless and condescending. One person replied: This is literally boomer mentality! Buying a sausage roll is not going to stop you from saving a deposit. Pointless video. Another wrote: No one cares with your condescending sh**e leave Greggs out of it. A warm breakfast every morning for eight years is worth more than a deposit on a property youaposll hardly see, proclaimed a third. Someone  pointed out: Every penny youaposve ever spent could have been saved and added to your deposit, but humans buy things. So this doesnapost work. While a fth couldnapost help but ask: Whoaposs spending £ at Greggs... Chill out, Greggs is my only source of happiness, added a sixth. However, others were a bit more sympathetic to what the estate agent was saying.A dferent user posted: I agree with the premise that a little change can add up but this kind of advice frustrates more than helps. The housing market is broken   The housing market is broken and telling people not to buy a coffee isnapost goingto change that  .Megan Grfiths, property media creator for the DM  Co. Homes said: Weaposve done a few videos like that and people love them. It really makes first time buyers realise how much they can save. Some users donapost really understand the point of the video or have the motivation to save. They donapost realise how much these things are and that it will add up over time. People are always going to make comments but I donapost take notice. House prices are only going up and because TikTok is aimed at a young audience itaposs good to make them aware of how they can save. If you stop spending money on these things you can save and get yourself on the property ladder.What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON GreggsHouse pricesEstate agentsViral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Shabaz Ali, of Blackburn, Lancashire, has made a number of claims about things he learned during his days behind the counter. Amongst other claims, he has said that baristas use coffee syrup rather than real coffee in Frappuccinos, while alleging that they also serve decaf coffee to rude customers. Shabaz, , who now works as a teacher, has also advised customers as to how to get themselves some free goodies from Starbucks - including free drinks and baked goods. The ex-barista says he began working for the world-famous coffee brand back in , and really enjoyed his time there, being a fan of Starbucks to this day. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.In a fascinating TikTok video that has clocked up more than , views and over , likes, Shabaz has now shared alleged insider knowledge from his barista days.Shabaz said: I was going through training and the manager told me about purposely writing names on the cups wrong for free publicity. [They also told me] to look out for influencers or younger people who seem the type to make a scene about it on social media, as they’ll definitely post about it.I was shocked, as this was probably the reason my name would be spelled wrong in the past. Frappuccinos don’t have espresso coffee they have a fake flavour version – soyou want real coffee, you have to ask for an espresso shot. He added: I was also told to pretend that something wasn’t in stockit would hold up a queue. Frappuccinos would usually take a long time to make, so on a busy day, I would tell them some syrups were out of stock or the ice machine was broken. This really shocked me, as I know other companies must do this as well.He went on to reveal a few hints and tips to bag Starbucks freebies, including free beverages and has also explained exactly what happens to leftover items. Shabaz said: You get a free drink on your birthdayyou tell the barista. At the end of the night, the bakery items need to be thrown out – soyou ask a barista, they might give these away to you. Some of this is taken to homeless shelters or given to the homeless, but most stores just bin food waste. If someone is a regular, you can give them syrups and other goodies for free. Most food is tried by the staff before it comes out, so always ask for their recommendations. They will also try a combination of all sorts and have their own secret special drinks, so ask them for advice and they’ll always get you what you want. He added: Drip filter coffee can be refilled for freeyou sit in. If you hate your drink, ask for another one, as the barista will always change this for you. If you ask for a medium drink, but want it in a large cup, chances are the barista will fill the cup for you because they always make a bit extra – so you get a large drink for free. Sadly, some Starbucks customers may be dismayed to learn that, according to Shabaz, there is no secret menu.Aghast fans have since expressed their surprise at some of the more unexpected revelations, with one person commenting, the decaf bit scared me. Another remarked, I heard the name thing but wasnapost fully sure, glad to get a confirmation, while a third person laughed, “I said my name’s Michelle they wrote McHale.

Weam, who is originally from Lebanon but lives in LA, found himself getting a taste for eating raw meat and says he would regularly chow down on five plates of raw organs for each meal as an appetiser.Motivated by a focus on his overall wellness, Weam later went on to follow a plant-based diet. However, this didnapost last long, with Weam claiming he began experiencing health issues as a result.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. After paying a visit to his doctor, who he claims found inflammation in his digestive and nervous system, Weam switched back to his raw meat meals and has no regrets. He said: As I adopted this diet, I started reading books about the benefits of meat and a lot of carnivore doctors eat their meat raw – so I decided to go for it. Weamaposs diet now consists of % raw meat and a whopping , calories every day in a bid to build his muscle. For breakfast, he will blend half a pound of raw beef with two teaspoons of raw butter, half a teaspoon of salt, and raw eggs, followed by a meaty lunch of two veal testicles, a veal brain, lamb liver, beef kidney, beef heart, beef bone marrow, and raw butter. At dinnertime, Weam will dine on raw steak slices and butter, sometimes pairing this meal with an unflavoured grass-fed protein shake. He said: My favourite raw food is my concoction [in the morning] and veal brains. I also like raw ribeyes and fillets. I’m not a fan of raw chicken and pork – I’ve actually never tried them. I don’t even eat them cooked either.Weam acknowledges that his diet comes with risk, but he believes the potential health benefits outweigh this and he says heaposs yet to experience any complications. You might risk bacterial infection, but a healthy gut is totally capable of destroying harmful bacteria, he claims. In a recent video uploaded to TikTok, which has so far received almost three million views and more than , likes, Weam canapost be seen taking a huge bite out of a raw veal brain, which he then washes down with a glass of raw eggs. Weamaposs followers couldnapost believe what they were watching. One person compared him to aposWolverineapos, while another declared that there would be a full moon tonight. Although he certainly has to contend with a somewhat mixed reaction to his diet, Weam doesnapost mind being called Wolverine at all. He said: He added: I get a lot of love from people who want help – especially overweight kids that struggle with confidence. I also get tons of hate, especially from the vegan community, who continuously report my account and threaten to remove it. A lot of people focus on being in shape within the fitness world, but neglect actually being healthy – physically and mentally. I’ve tried all diets and struggled with haemorrhoids, as well as anal fischers [in the past]. Using the restroom was a struggle for me until I started my meat-only diet and now my digestion is optimal. Raw meat is the easiest to digest and I don’t care what doctors say, I know what I feel.Do you have an unusual food or fitness-related story to share  We pay for stories.

She was asked to be a bridesmaid for her sisteraposs wedding but was shocked to learn the ceremony was set to be aposchild freeapos, and she had recently had a baby. In the end, the woman told her sister thatshe wanted her there and didnapost want children at the wedding then she would have to change the date - and now the family are ided. What do you think about the brideaposs demands  Let us know in the comments... Taking to Reddit, the would-be bridesmaid wrote: She got upset but left it for a few days and then came back to me, asking why.My daughter is exclusively breastfed, every three hours, and wonapost take a bottle under any circumstance . So I quite literally canapost leave her. She got upset and said the baby would take the bottleshe got hungry enough, which I disagree with. After some more arguing, I told her she could either let me bring the baby or not have me come at all.  She continued: It was more arguing, I stated, aposthen youaposll just have to reschedule your weddingapos in response to her saying I need to be there. She got huffy and left, and ever since then family members have been treating me like I told her Iaposd kill her firstborn.The poster - who goes by the username u aitaweddit - went on the explain how sheaposd also made it clear to her sister that finding childcare for her eldest daughter would also be dficult, given that sheaposs autistic and has pretty severe meltdowns.

Despite knowing that attending the wedding would be a real struggle for her, the poster - who is a single parent - still feels awful for upsetting her sister, who isnapost even inviting her own son to the wedding. She now wondersshe could have gone about things in a kinder way. Her fellow Reddit users have since sympathised with her dficult situation, with one person reasoning: Although it is reasonable to have a child free wedding, she knew damn well youaposd have a baby by then. Could she not make an exception for newborns though   Itaposs not like they cause chaos by running around and carrying on! They mostly sleep. Another wrote: If she really wanted you there she would make accommodations for your children. They didn’t just suddenly appear, she’s known all along that you can’t leave them.

Holly Charles @hollyecharleshas gone viral on TikTok for sharing snippets of conversations she has with guys she meets online. After successfully matching with someone from Hinge or Tinder, she takes things to Snapchat where the couple can voice note each other.Voice notes are more intimate than texting and less awkward than a phone call, so it makes for a good way to learn a bit more about your match and decipher whether you want to meet up in person.

The phenomenon is caused by large gusts of wind lt the small sand particles from the cool air on the ground in the desert into hotter air in the skies, which is then carried across the Mediterranean. Skiers did not seem fazed by the new look slopes as several were pictured continuing with their trips. Several were eager to take pictures of the hillsides turned orange by the dust particles. Previously, scientic studies have suggested the layers of Saharan dust could increase the risk of avalanches on the French Alps, although it is yet to be proven.  The skies across regions of Spain also turned an eerie shade of yellow and orange yesterday, which continued on to France. Some people in the UK have woken up to find a bizarre orange tint outside their windows, including in the south east, as well as dust particles on their cars. Earlier a UK atmospheric scientist warned Brits of a signicant reduction in air quality and a chance that motorists may wake up to find their cars covered in Saharan dust.Dr Claire Ryder, who works at the University of Reading, said: The plume is forecast to reach southern England during the early hours of Wednesday, covering areas from Dorset to Suffolk, with the southeast counties, particularly Kent, being the worst affected. “The main plume is forecast to remain over the continent with only the weaker edges grazing southern England. Dust amounts will likely be signicantly lower over England compared to extremely dusty conditions currently being experienced over Spain and France. “Those up early enough on Wednesday will see the tell-tale red dusty sunrise. This is caused by the dust absorbing blue light from the sun and letting more red light through when the sun is low in the sky.  “By evening the dust will have moved eastwards towards the Netherlands and Germany.” There were warnings for people who suffer with asthma to carry their inhalers as the Saharan dust can leave people struggling to breathe properly. Around . million people have the condition in the UK. Other countries to have experienced the bizarre orange skies include Algeria and Austria. The changes to the world’s climate could mean more of the sand changing the colours of skies in the coming years, experts have predicted.

The ultra-powerful scan has proven there are two hidden voids inside the largest man-made pyramid on Earth, and now archaeologists are planning to get a better look inside with better technology.The largest of the two voids is  feet long and  feet wide and archaeologists are hoping new scans will uncover what the mysterious voids were used for.Researchers believe the best case scenario would be the uncovering of the hidden burial chamber of pharaoh Khufu, who reigned over Egypt from  BC to  BC, and was the man the pyramid was built for. A team of researchers behind the incredible find want to use equipment x more powerful than the stuff they used for this discovery. They said: We plan to field a telescope system that has upwards of  times the sensitivity of the equipment that has recently been used at the Great Pyramid. Since the detectors that are proposed are very large, they cannot be placed inside the pyramid, therefore our approach is to put them outside and move them along the base.  In this way, we can collect muons from all angles in order to build up the required data set. Muons are particles similar to electrons and can be picked up by sensitive telescopes. The new project to discover what the voids were used for will involve the super sensitive particles which react dferently with air and stone and will help map out the inside of the pyramid and reveal any pockets of air.  The Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has given permission for the scans but the team still need funding. The voids were originally revealed, in less detail, back in  after a two year Scan Pyramids project. Described at the time as a aposdeep voidapos, the passage was thought to be least ft long and up to ft above ground. The Great Pyramid was one of the original seven wonders of the ancient world, and was once the worldaposs tallest structure at ft high and ft wide. Also known as Khufuaposs Pyramid after the pharaoh who commissioned it as his tomb, Giza is the only original ancient wonder to remain intact - and many details about its purpose and history remain a secret. It was completed in around  BC and was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than , years.

Mr Stone tweeted: Although the US has many wars of aggression on its conscience, it doesnapost justy Mr Putinaposs aggression in Ukraine. A dozen wrongs donapost make a right... Russia was wrong to invade.Russian sports stars likewise shared their opposition to the invasion, despite the risks that come with speaking out against Putin. Formerly pro-Kremlin world leaders, including the heads of Hungary and the Czech Republic, have also broken ranks with Putin by condemning Russiaaposs attack.It comes as Ukrainian forces continue to fiercely resist the Russian invasion, with reports of low morale among Putinaposs soldiers. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here  Athletes Scores of Russian sports stars have come out in opposition to Putinaposs war, calling for an end to the conflict. Tennis player Andrey Rublev wrote the words aposNo war pleaseapos on a camera lens after winning a match in Dubai last month.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, previously a close ally of Putin, likewise joined the chorus of opposition to Russiaaposs attack. In a similar move, Marine Le Pen, a French far-right leader, tried to distance herself from the Russian despot and called the attack “unjustiable without reservations. And former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, a supporter of Putin in the past, slammed military aggression against Ukraine and called for a “common response from allies. Actors French actor Gerard Depardieu, who embraced his pal Putin after receiving Russian citizenship, described the war as fratricidal and urged his friend to start negotiations.Russian comedian Ivan Urgant, who has a late-night show on state TV, shared a black square on Instagram and wrote “Fear and pain.

Challenges like the terrain, and transport issues have severely hampered Moscow’s ability to advance across what is the biggest European country by landmass. On top of that, an inability to secure control of the sky has “drastically limited” their ability to utilise jets and limited their options further. On top of that, the military acumen of the Ukrainian forces and the tactics they have used have exploited Russian weakness and inflicted “heavy losses” on Putin’s invading forces.Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here In a statement released on Twitter, they said: “Russian forces are struggling to overcome the challenges posed by Ukraine’s terrain.“They have remained largely tied to Ukraine’s road network and have demonstrated a reluctance to conduct off-road manoeuvres.“The destruction of bridges by Ukrainian forces has also played a key role in stalling Russia ’s advance.“Russia’s continued failure to gain control of the air has drastically limited their ability to effectively use air manoeuvres, further limiting their options.  “The tactics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have adeptly exploited Russia’s lack of manoeuvre, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on invading forces.” This comes as one of Putinaposs closest allies has admitted Russiaaposs invasion of Ukraine have not gone to plan. Viktor Zolotov, chief of Russiaaposs national guard and apart of Putinaposs security council, said progress of the invasion had been slower than expected. He said: I would like to say that yes, not everything is going as fast as we would like, Zolotov said in comments posted on the National Guardaposs website. But we are going towards our goal step by step and victory will be for us.  Zolotov has been at Putinaposs side since before the turn of the century and has spent the last  years in charge of his personal security. His comments, made at a church service led by Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on Sunday, have reflected reports from Western intelligence and mark a departure from official Kremlin lines so far. This comes as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine comes to the end of its third week. In that time, Russia has lost four major generals and nearly a dozen high-ranking officers. It has sustained heavier casualties than Ukraine, and lost more tanks than Germany has in its army.  It was reported, Russia initially planned a ‘lightning invasion’ that would have seen Putin’s forces sweep the country and take Kyiv in a matter of days. However, now the Kremlin finds itself in protracted warfare against Ukraine’s forces and negotiating with the government it hoped to oust. Russia’s invasion has reportedly been plagued with issues such as low morale and supply issues. A number of videos have circulated on social media, showing Russian vehicles running out of fuel. Russia has maintained the invasion is going to plan, but reports from US intelligence officials have said they have been asking China for military equipment since the beginning of the invasion.  After initial failures to conquer Ukraineaposs cities, Russia has turned to relentless shelling and bombing of civilian targets. The deadly invasion has led to thousands of deaths and has led to over three million refugees having fled from their homes since February . The United Nations High Commission for Refugees said, that as of March , ,, Ukrainians had left their homes. Over half of these, ,,, have entered into Poland, the main destination of refugees so far, but it is not known how many intend to stay here, or move in to other countries. Despite its size, Moldova has taken in , people, the most per capita of any nation. Over , Ukrainians, largely from the country’s eastern regions, have fled into Russia.

walk on the wild side at its latest meeting as Argyll Estates# head stalker set his sights on an entertaining evening.Tom Kirsop provided society members with an informative and imaginative talk at their February gathering, covering his work and experiences on the local estate.Growing up in Clydebank, Tom had always had an interest in animals and moved to Argyll as a forest ranger in Dalmally.Since starting to work with Argyll Estates, which he thoroughly enjoys, Tom has been able to develop his work with animals in many dferent ways.In Queen Victoria’s time the current ,-acre estate was on an even bigger scale and has witnessed a huge increase in the number of deer since then.This has been due to the lack of any natural predators and, with further planting of trees since the s, the deer have had more protective covering.Modern inventions such as drones and the use of argocats, have made it easier for people working on estates to estimate numbers of deer more accurately and to be able to meet the necessary annual targets of keeping the deer population to manageable levels.Working on the estate also involves a range of other projects, such as collecting data on golden eagles, barn owls, making fishing available at the Glen Shira dam and taking clients out stalking.More recently Tom has started up West Highland Wildle Tours to give people of all ages a real insight into the wildle and beautul scenery on our doorstep.For the society#s March meeting, Ken MacTaggart will give a presentation about #The Medieval Pilgrim Way to Loch Awe#.The venue will be Inveraray church hall on Tuesday March , starting at .pm.Everyone is welcome.

GHK broke the deadlock to score the first try of the game  minutes into the game, then missed the conversion.Mid Argyll then put together some great attacking plays and earned a penalty just outside the GHK -metre line.Inside centre Coll MacKay stepped up to score Mid Argyll#s first points of the campaign with a glorious conversion.  –  to GHK.GHK went on to score two more tries and one conversion # before disaster struck for Mid Argyll on the stroke of half time and with the score at  –  to GHK, as Wilson hobbled off with suspected knee ligament damage.With Wilson playing out of position in the front row, Mid Argyll had to reshuffle an already patchwork pack with Aaron McAllister moving from the wing to hooker and usual hooker Robbie Herd moving to prop.The new look front row finished off, Daniel Doherty doing well, as they held their own against an experienced opposition pack.Mid Argyll took time to settle into the new system, though, and GHK ran in two more converted tries.Mid Argyll almost produced the perfect reply when fly-half Logan Allen whipped a quick ball out to Gritten who, without actually catching the ball, flicked it on to Innes Patterson.Patterson beat two players and released Ed King-Venables who was caught by the GHK defence just short of the line.GHK ran the ball back up field but some great defensive play from flanker Gordon McLean, Self and MacArthur stopped them on the halfway line.A scrum to Mid Argyll saw scrum-half Calum Patterson pick the ball from the feet of McLean and, noticing a gap in the defence, broke through.He still had two more players to beat before he ran over the whitewash for Mid Argyll#s first try of the season # undoubtedly try of the match. MacKay converted for another two points and the score was  –  GHK.Having played with no subs, fatigue was starting to set in for the Argyll boys and with GHK using their subs they ran in a few more breakaway tries.Towards the end of the game GHK had one last attempt and broke through the Argyll defence, but from nowhere C Patterson found the determination and energy to chase the attacker down and fling out an arm to ankle tap him five metres short of the line and supporting was Lochlain Ellis to compete for the ball and earn Mid Argyll a deserved penalty.The final whistle sounded shortly after and the game finished  - to GHK.Mid Argyll enjoyed great hospitality from hosts GHK and Innes Patterson was awarded man of the match before the long journey home."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 3","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWhatever the rights and wrongs of Putin#s invasion of Ukraine, which has been shocking to witness from afar, one thing has shone through.The courage of the Ukranian people should serve as inspiration to each of us to stand against tyranny, in all its forms.As ever when the powerful invoke conflict, it#s the not-so-powerful and less wealthy who bear the brunt.

I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#.

Where, indeed, does compassion fit where survival is at stake Some offered to be left outside, while others were desperate to be in the shelter, stretching the truth as they did so.Then, with the zombies fast-approaching, another layer of information was revealed about each member.Paralympian Lorraine, in fact, is a wheelchair user. Nic, the rock-climbing medic, has a history of depression and is transgender . Imran is a tourist with English as a second language. Grant, it turned out, is an electrical whiz with a history of an eating disorder.

the previous weekend through a flurry of late goals, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils took the lead within the opening minute.Captain Keith Mitchell’s ball down the left channel found winger Scott Souden, who cut inside and rounded the far-advanced St Peter’s goalkeeper, way out of his penalty area, and tucked the ball home low from around  yards.The first half was a well-contested affair, with chances at both ends, with the Pupils’ Lewis McNaughton and Donald McCallum both going close with efforts at goal, while at the other end, St Peter’s continued to probe for an equaliser.This arrived just a few minutes before half-time, albeit in rather fortuitous circumstances, when a low shot from the visitors’ centre-forward from just inside the box evaded the grasp of keeper Alasdair Ferguson.Early into the second half, the Pupils found themselves - down after St Peter’s converted a penalty kick, skipper Mitchell having been adjudged to have brought down an onrushing midfielder.Souden then had a good chance double his and the Feather-sponsored Pupils’ goal tally after meeting Ryan Deans’ fine cross from the right-hand side of the box, but he couldn’t guide his cushioned header on target.The Pupils played the last  minutes of the match with  men when Jamie Burns was sent off for a tackle which was not malicious but was late.In believing that a goal-scoring opportunity had been denied, despite the foul taking place at least  yards from goal, the referee decided to show the Pupils defender a red card.This numerical advantage eventually paid off for the visitors in the closing minutes as a long throw-in was flicked on into a gaping space inside the box where a St Peter’s midfielder calmly side-footed a low right-foot shot into the net beyond Ferguson.It was a painful defeat for the Pupils, who acquitted themselves very well during the match and enjoyed spells of possession and pressure during the game, and in front of another healthy home crowd.However, their more clinical visitors took their chances when they arrived and managed to keep at bay most Pupils attacks in the second half to take all three points from Kintyre.Tomorrow , the Pupils host Glenvale FC, another Paisley side, in league action.Kick off is pm at Kintyre Park.

Harbour for more than  years, catching a iety of shellfish such as lobster, brown crab and whelk.The fishing industry was one of the hardest hit by the compounded effects of Brexit and lockdown but the family-run business has managed to turn a potential hurdle into a success.Lawrie said: “When lockdown just kicked in, that was the end of the foreign markets.“We had been thinking about changing how we operate but that forced us.“We had it in our mind to start selling privately because of Brexit as well and it all just came together, and we’ve not really looked back.”Lawrie and Eddie have now shted their business to much more of a local focus, selling their catch to restaurants and the public in the local area while also offering a delivery service.Lawrie said: “Everything was shipped into Europe beforehand but now we are selling direct to restaurants mainly in Edinburgh and a few places in East Lothian.“Everything we catch gets sold within  miles so instead of shipping into France, Spain and wherever , it’s nice for us to see what the stuff that we catch is being used for.”In Scotland it is not illegal to catch egg-bearing lobsters, but Lawrie believes this is harmful for the long-term viability of the industry and promotes a far more sustainable model.“We see that as madness that we are taking away that stock for the future, so we’ve completely eliminated that and we don’t keep any egg bearing females at all, they go straight back in the sea, straight away,” he said.“The creels that we use are recycled plastics so in that respect we are more sustainable with the materials that we use.”Lawrie also added that they were looking into using electric vans to help reduce their carbon footprint, which has already been greatly reduced by their new local model.“Because we are selling locally, that’s food miles that’s being cut down as well,” he added.The new model has also allowed everyone at Belhaven Lobster to become more involved locally and reconnect with the community at a personal level.Lawrie said: “During the first lockdown, people were looking for things to get out of the house for, a reason to go and try something a bit dferent.“So when we were selling direct to the public, you got to speak to people, connect with people and get their story and what they were planning to do with the shellfish that we catch.“They were getting our side of the story as well, and they were interested to find out how we catch them and where we catch them.“It was good for the customers, good for us and I think it has benefited the harbour in general as well.”Archerfield House by Dirleton is one of the venues that Belhaven Lobster supplies, with executive chefs David Jamieson and Joe Queen dedicated to using locally sourced goods.Joe said: “It’s just a great company to deal with.“In all sorts of weather, we are guaranteed to get the product we are after and to deal with they are just great guys that want to look after the customers.“We wanted them involved because they are so good, they are friendly but it’s the consistency of the product.“We need it kept local we need it kept home.“There’s always a need, especially for shellfish, in any decent restaurant.“We have a great relationship now, and long may it continue.”While the Belhaven Lobster team are not sure where the future may take them, they are eager to keep growing and expanding.Lawrie said: “Hopefully we are going to keep going with what we are doing andwe can pick up more and more restaurants and customers then that’s great.“We can hopefully try and expand a little bit more and see where it takes us.”"},{"url":null,"title":"aitken-pharmacy-end-era-pharmacist-gordon","story":"Gordon Coventry has been a familiar figure at Aitken Pharmacy on Dunbar High Street for more than

He agreed to a further meeting with the directors of Dunbar Community Development and Heritage Trustin February. Cllr Hampshire has not responded to email requests.Cllr Hampshire states “the woodland area is in pretty poor condition and there has never been any management take place”. DCWG has never had any role or responsibility for that part of Lochend Wood. It is in the privately owned  hectares at Hallhill West and North. DCWG have successfully managed a separate  hectares of Lochend Wood since .As Cllr Hampshire describes, drainage ditches have collapsed at his proposed site. It is now waterlogged, not suitable for construction.An environmental impact assessment is essential. His proposed site is wild land, habitat to wildle – deer, foxes, possibly badgers, many bird species, some rare, and bats too.Lochend Wood will soon be completely surrounded by built environment.Development would be catastrophic for wildle, already suffering from signicant habitat loss and stress. Cllr Hampshire acknowledges “there is still wildle in the woodland and we will do everything we can to make sure we protect that”.Clearly, the best way to protect this area for wildle, including nocturnal species, is to NOT fill it with floodlights and noisy, boisterous humans.He continues: “People complain about young people hanging around and doing things they should not be doing.”Yet this proposal aims to attract kids to a location that is isolated and not overseen. This is dangerous. Emergency services have been called to deal with gatherings in the woods in recent times – ambulances for vulnerable young adolescents suffering serious alcohol effects, fire services, and police to disperse large groups. This location would create a perfect storm of risk.His vision – a ‘community cafe’, open  till  – would cost tens of thousands of pounds to install basic services to the site. How could this be sustainable  Even the Bleachingfield Centre cafe, with the library on site, close to the town centre and the primary school, was not viable. He suggests young people could watch television at the hub. Why not Bleachingfield or the Hallhill Centre  Why waste precious resources Great new facilities – The Space at DunBear Park – are planned. McDonald’s is already a hub for young people and it’s near bus stops. It would be perfect to locate the youth hub adjacent to The Space, somewhere kids can have some freedom, not under close adult scrutiny, yet where they could still access help from adults at Asdaneeded.

Tens of thousands of civilians are being killed and driven from their homes. We see the confused elderly, the frightened children, and the anxious parents nightly on our televisions. And while Ms Blythman talks of \"finding a settlement that Putin might accept\" we know exactly what Vladimir Putin might accept – he couldn’t have been clearer.Putin is not the kind of negotiator familiar from the classic business deal scenario in which I ask for a £, you offer £ and we settle for £ plus or minus a pound or two. For all the speculation about his mental health, he has been utterly consistent from the very outset. He wants Donetsk, Lukhansk, and Crimea to be ceded to Russia he wants Ukraine disarmed and permanently barred from joining either the EU or Nato. And we can be utterly confident that any Ukrainian citizens who express dissent in a future \"Ukraine\" will be labelled \"Nazis\" and treated in the same way that Putin critics like Navalny are treated in Russia. In other words, he wants Ukraine to cease to exist as a normal sovereign nation. In the meantime he pursues a policy of relentless bombing of Ukrainian cities, reducing thriving cities of the size of Edinburgh and Glasgow and larger to rubble. Sanctions will not stop this. So what does \"stand with Ukraine\" meanwe are not prepared to confront Putin more directly The technicalities of no-fly zones or other options are for the experts. But whatever the means, it is surely time for Putin to be convinced that there is a point, a \"red line\", at which the West will deploy its overwhelming force. I’ve long been sceptical of the line that we have Nato to thank for keeping the peace in Europe. Yet it is precisely Nato in its present structure that has stopped us preventing war. And, yes, I know where that possibly leads – but with each day that passes it’s becoming clearer that Putin himself is pushing for the escalation and internationalisation of the conflict. I fear that this will happen, whether we like it or not. If that is so, the question is only whether we are to be acting on the basis of our own choices or merely reacting to him – regrettably, the story thus far.George Pattison , St Monans, Fe.THE WORLD NEEDS RESOLUTE ACTIONTHE parallels between - and the last few years tell us that we face something far more sinister than a little local dficulty over Ukraine.

They held in contempt the rule of law and their promises were lies, as Poland found. The point is, her fall was just the start of an obscene trajectory, and so is the current situation.An evil gospel has awful power, and Vladimir Putin’s newspeak is no less chilling for being delivered at conversational volume. Right now he is slaughtering the innocent but the trajectory includes chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and the destruction of Ukraine’s people as only step one. We should be under no illusions.Bullies don’t need non-retaliation, they need control. The world needs resolute, overwhelming actionwe are not to descend into something much worse than currently fills our screens. As a mere first step,Nato could impose a non-fly zone over non-Nato Bosnia, it can do so over Ukraine. If President Putin can be given a dignied way out, so much the better but the lives of the innocent come first.Pascal’s words stand. \"Justice without force is a myth, because there are always bad men force without justice stands convicted of itself. We must therefore put together justice and force, and so dispose things that whatever is just is mighty, and whatever is mighty is just.\"C Peter White, Torrance.* WHY are we sanctioning Russia and certain of its citizens when we have no dispute with that country We are doing more damage to ourselves than to anyone , particularly on the financial and energy fronts.Russia can sell all its energy to China, and it can bank where.

Does Mr Brown ever look south of the Border at the ious public projects which have foundered and cost billionsin overruns, HS and Crossrail to name just two  And one wonders what arguments Councillor Gallacher would usehe ever looked around him at the smallnations who are thriving mightily, somehow, without all the benefits of being attached umbilically to Westminster and England how on earth do they manage Thank goodness for Alasdair Galloway then with his explanation of why unionists desire to avoid a vote at all costs by gerrymandering and manipulation, he correctly describes their motivation: fear.Ironically though, I am in agreement with Mr Brown and Councillor Gallacher on one thing: now is not the time for a referendum. We are about to experience a period of instability and social stress that we have not experienced in my  years of le, much of it down to the policies of successive Tory and right-wing Labour governments, namely de-industrialisation, austerity, and the catastrophic pursuit of the wealth that Russias oligarchs have stolen from their people.As Mr Galloway suggests, such upheaval is usually followed by political and social realignment. Here are a couple of predictions: after Vladimir Putin is defeated the need for a United Europe will be clearer. We will see a European defence force established as part of Nato, quite quickly followed by moves to a United States of Europe. The UK will be isolated as an anachronism in a world of super states, and Scotland will take the opportunity to join with Europe as part of that process. If all of that takes  years or more then so be it, I just hope I live to see it.If I were a unionist I would take the SNP at its word and force a referendum through now it might well be their last best chance.John Jamieson, Ayr.WHY WE NEED A SUPERMAJORITYI AM constantly disappointed and dismayed when advocates for any particular cause become so committed to their goals that they fail to accept obvious truths. Alasdair Gallowayonce again fails to accept the fundamental dference between a major, possibly once in a letime, constitutional vote and a General Election. Surely even he can see that Brexit, inconceivable had a supermajority been required, has been something less than an outstanding success. There are several good reasons why a majority signicantly greater than % + is needed when seeking major long-term constitutional change.I know committed supporters of Scottish independence who share these views and would not relish victorynot wholeheartedly endorsed by the Scottish public.Jim Meikle, Killearn.Read more: Face facts over indy and start tackling real problems"},{"url":null,"title":"storm-celia-stong-winds-bring-saharan-dust-uk","story":"Storm Celia has moved towards the UK after bringing Saharan dust and travel disruption to southern Spain, the MET Office warned. The dust is mainly being carried two kilometres above ground level but deposits of dust may begin to fall to the ground, especially during any rain. It is expected the south of the UK will be affected the most by the dust as the storm front moves north. We can see the #SaharanDust that has pushed across Spain and France, into southeast EnglandWhilst this #dust is mostly about km above ground level, some deposits may fall to the ground, especially during todays rain in southern parts of the UK pic mxfcnkcv: ScotRail nationalisation to cost taxpayers more than £mRichard Miles, of the Met Office, told the PA news agency: “Storm Celia over Spain is indeed pulling a dust cloud up from the Sahara, which could potentially reach as far as the south of the UK.“However, we don’t expect signicant impacts – the most likely would be on the cloudscapes at sunset, but as conditions are likely to be generally overcast and wet for much of the day this is unlikely to amount to much.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use.

Women living in rural areas across the UK are also much more likely than men to seek help with %, saying they would talk to someonethey were struggling .i The findings come as Samaritans launches a new phase of its Real People, Real Stories campaign, supported by NFU Mutual Charitable Trust, which aims to reach men in rural communities who are struggling to cope to prevent them reaching crisis point. In the UK and Ireland, men are three to four times more likely to die by suicide than women.Over three quarters of people in Northern Ireland living in rural areasalso said there was at least one barrier that would stop them reaching out for support eventhey were struggling. Lack of privacySamaritans discovered the top three barriers are concern over lack of privacy , not knowing who to turn toand stigma around mental health .As evidence suggests that suicide rates are higher in rural areas compared to urban areasiii and rural-based occupations, such as those in agriculture, have also been shown to have an increased risk of suicide, the UK’s leading suicide prevention charity is raising awareness amongst men in these environments to let them know they do not need to face things alone. Nigel, a Samaritan volunteer in Northern Ireland who is a farmer said: “The farming communities tend to have less contact with the outside world, they are isolated, feel undervalued and have many financial issues. Many are working full time in jobs and trying to farm at the same time.“From my experience farming communities are less likely to seek help as they don’t want other people to know about their problems, there is a real fear of being judged. As a farmer myself I get a lot from volunteering with Samaritans, I can be there for people when they need someone.”Real People, Real StoriesSpeaking about the Charity’s Real People, Real Stories campaign, Professor Siobhan O’Neill, Mental Health Champion for Northern Ireland said: “People who live in rural areas can feel disconnected and isolated, and this can lead to suicidal pain. “There is so much stigma surrounding mental health and it can be hard to find the words to say that we are struggling. It is important that we all understand and speak about our feelings, and that people who are suffering reach out for support. “Suicidal thoughts are a sign that something about our lives needs to change and this campaign shows us the benefits of reaching out for help and reminds us that change is possible”. Marie Nesbitt Samaritans Ballymena Branch Manager commented: “Samaritans is here for anyone struggling to cope, no matter who you are or where you are. “Mental health challenges and suicide are complex, going beyond simply where you live or what profession you are in but these can be factors. The increased risk factors for those living in rural and agricultural settings such as poor access to services, isolation and persistent loneliness mean it’s essential for us to do more to reach people in these environments. “We hope this new Real People, Real Stories campaign will raise awareness of the support that’s out there and encourage more people to seek help early on, so that we can continue the drive to reduce suicide rates across NI.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4519110.jpg--.jpg?1647425130000\n","title":"win an opportunity to meet professor brian cox","story":"Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is delighted to be working in partnership with Well North Enterprisesand Professor Brian Cox CBE to bring the prestigious Science Summer School to Northern Ireland in November  at The Braid Arts Centre, Ballymena.Through collaboration with headline sponsor Ryobi Aluminium Casting and key sponsors Almac Group, IPC Mouldings, Michelin Development, Northern Regional College, Randox Laboratories and Terumo Blood and Cell Technologies the event will aim to inspire young people to become the next generation of scientists with an inspirational programme that mixes the best of STEAMthrough a series of TED-style talks, seminars, discussions and hands-on workshops.The Science Summer School is not a stand-alone event but is a catalyst for a collaborative vision for the borough to nurture future talent and as part of the event we are asking pupils to ‘Activate your Curiosity’ by creating an original t-shirt design that reflects one of three themes: Activate your Curiosity First Attempts or The Universe.There are fantastic prizes on offer - the winning t-shirt will be printed and the designer will have the opportunity to meet Professor Brian Cox CBE in November .The best ideas will also be included in the Gallery of First Attempts exhibition in the Mid-Antrim Museum at The Braid in conjunction with this exciting event.The competition is open to all schools in the borough from Key Stage  through to Key Stage  and to enter students must attend a school in the Mid and East Antrim Borough Council area.

Credit: Liam McBurneyGarrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailProgress on climate legislation has been slow and arduous in Northern Ireland, in part due to its dependence on agriculture, an industry responsible for % of greenhouse gas emissions.A bill has now been passed but does it go far enough and what targets does Northern Ireland need to meet in order to secure real change that would benefit both the environment and public health Climate change billNorthern Ireland has finally brought itself in line with every other country in Western Europe by approving its own climate change legislation.Late progress was made in this Assembly mandate however there was some criticism that Northern Ireland remains an exception in delivering net-zero ambitions.MLAs passed an amendment tabled by Minister Edwin Poots which caps the target for methane emissions.The Minister argued that cutting cattle herds was not an option, particularly with an escalating crisis in Ukraine which could impact food supplies in Northern Ireland.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up His amendment sets a separate target for methane as part of wider ambitions for net zero emissions by . It means that methane emissions for  are not required to be more than % lower than the  baseline. The law now needs to be implemented.Read MoreAssembly passes climate Bill committing Northern Ireland to net zero by Tree coverageNorthern Ireland ranks badly as one of the least-wooded regions in Europe, with just % woodland cover compared with the European average of %. In addition, almost % of our woodland is in the form of recent coner plantations.The Woodland Trust said Northern Ireland needs to signicantly increase tree plantingit is to help towards a UK woodland target.The conservation charity previously published its Emergency Tree Plan. The plan sets out how the UK can rapidly increase tree cover to help reach net zero carbon emissions and tackle the declines in wildle.Northern Ireland would need to plant , hectares of trees a year to hit an existing target of % cover by . To contribute to this, the Forests For our Future Programme announced by Mr Poots in March  set targets to create , hectares of new woodland by , which falls well short of those recommended by the Woodland Trust.The Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairshas a woodland expansion target  hectares for  .Ammonia emissionsAmmonia is an air pollutant largely emitted from agriculture and has a damaging impact on bioersity, including sensitive habitats, as well as human health. It is produced by many common farming activities, such as the housing of livestock, the storage and spreading of manure and slurries, and the application of fertiliser.An Audit Office report from February found that most areas of Northern Ireland, including designated sites and other priority habitats, are affected by high levels of nitrogen being deposited on land and into water surfaces.The levels in most areas are signicantly above what is considered their “critical load”, the concentration of nitrogen at which signicant ecological damage occurs. Northern Ireland is responsible for % of UK ammonia emissions, despite only having % of its population and % of its land area, and is the only region of the UK where ammonia levels have not been decreasing.“Failure to address the increasing level of ammonia emissions also has the potential to contribute to serious, long-term harm to the environment and human health,” the report concluded.Mr Poots has conceded that a failure to publish an Ammonia Reduction Strategywill be a regret when he leaves office and it is one that has left the department vulnerable to legal challenge. However, he stresses that he wants to publish a strategy before leaving office.Independent Environmental Protection AgencyUnder an outline programme for government in the New Decade, New Approach, a number of coordinated measures to reverse climate change were laid out.They included an Independent Environmental Protection Agencyto oversee targets that would be set as part of climate change legislation.Mr Poots is opposed to the establishment of an IEPA, believing it to be unnecessary bureaucracy. However, he has proposed setting up an office of environmental protection to do similar independent work.Conservation Management PlansNorthern Ireland is home to important nature and wildle, of both national and international importance, which are a key part of the Northern Ireland landscape, providing a wide range of goods and services to society and helping to deal with climate change.The UK faced formal infringement proceedings by the European Commission because of the failure to have in place Conservation Management Plansfor its European sites.There are  special areas of conservation and  special protection areas in Northern Ireland. Strangford Lough and Rathlin Island were reported to the commission as having a CMP in place.That leaves  sites without such plans in Northern Ireland.At the time of the infraction proceedings it was reported to the Commission Rathlin Island and Strangford Lough had Conservation Management Plansin place.The Commission took the view that developing CMPs for each of the remaining SACs would signicantly contribute to addressing the alleged failings to comply with the obligations under the Habitats Directive.DAERA subsequently embarked on a signicant programme of work to develop such CMPs to date draft CMPs have been developed for  of the SAC sites, with the intention to have draft plans for all SACs completed by December .Clear AirAir pollution is the top environmental risk to human health in the UK, and the fourth greatest threat to public health after cancer, heart disease and obesity.The Clean Air Strategy, published in January  by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs , sets out a number of objectives to improve air quality across the UK.Additionally, DAERA issued a Clean Air Strategy for Northern Ireland Discussion Document for public consideration in November . The period of public discussion closed in early .This strategy aims to build on existing improvements within Northern Ireland and seeks to tackle important cross-Departmental issues relating to transport, energy, agriculture, industry, local air quality management, and communications.An air quality strategy was anticipated but has not been published. Minister Poots says that recommendations await the next office holder.Mobuoy super dumpAt public meetings, government officials have been repeatedly challenged to urgently deal with an estimated one million cubic metres of waste at the Mobuoy “super dump” on the outskirts of Derry. The River Faughan which forms the western boundary of the site supplies the city with % of its drinking water.Ongoing legal action has been blamed for delaying remediation work at the site. That trial is due to commence next month.The clean-up cost at Mobuoy has been estimated at a minimum of £ million — and potentially as much as £ million.NI Water and DAERA have always assured the public that chemicals present in drinking water are at safe levels. However, campaigners contend there are “no safe levels” of arsenic or manganese as exposure to such chemicals can have a long-term damaging effect on the brain.It is expected that based on successful approval of a business case, a remediation contractor will be appointed by late .Ban on petroleum licensingIn a somewhat unexpected move, the DUP Economy Minister, Gordon Lyons, announced that he would support a ban on fracking and onshore petroleum licensing activity in Northern Ireland.Fracking is broadly banned across the UK and Ireland. In England, the Government told the industry it would not agree to any future fracking “until compelling new evidence is provided” that it was safe.Two petroleum licensing applications in NI relate to Fermanagh, where a company called Tamboran Resources UK applied for a licence in .A separate application from EHA Exploration takes in five council areas: Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Mid Ulster.However, Sinn Fein said it is “bitterly disappointing” that as a result of the DUP collapsing the Executive, that ban cannot now be brought forward.Water pollutionA recent ‘Water Framework Directive Statistics Report’ determined that none of Northern Ireland’s  rivers, lakes and coastal waters achieved a “good overall status” rating for water quality.Environmentalists have argued that minimal fines handed down for water pollution do not act as an appropriate deterrent for repeat offenders.Figures obtained by Green Party MLA Rachel Woods showed that more than seven million tonnes of raw sewage is being dumped into Northern Ireland’s seas and rivers every year.NI Water requires investment of around £bn in water and wastewater services over a six year period, the Utility Regulator said in May. This financial year the DfI Minister allocated a combined budget £m to NI Water for  .Coal banSmoky coal is one of the worst causes of air pollution. It has been reported that approximately , premature deaths have been averted in Dublin since the introduction of a coal ban back in . In the past, DUP MP Sammy Wilson strongly opposed proposals saying that low-income households who use cheap coal would be adversely affected as smokeless coal costs more.In response, then Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said: “It is great to hear Saint Sammy, defender of the disadvantaged — I do not know what happened to Sammy, the champion of the Tory cuts — make all these arguments on behalf of those suffering fuel poverty.“There is not a word about the big business interests of those in the coal business or, indeed, the interests of Larne port in his own constituency.”DUP MLA Michelle McIlveen, who was DAERA Minister before the Assembly collapsed, also said it was not her intention to ban smoky coal in the North.Now, Mr Poots, says he has no intention of banning coal because people would “die of hypothermia” in homes that are not properly insulated.Most ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerUnionists hail government U-turn over ‘United Kingdom’ to ‘Great Britain’ customs switchNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreUUP leader ‘too unwell’ to attend St Patrick’s Day events in WashingtonTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayMoral questions raised over use of Russian coal in Northern Ireland PlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest EnvironmentUp to £m of RHI money may go unspent by StormontStormont crisis ‘farcical and very damaging’ – Green Party leader easy ways to ‘green-proof’ your home that won’t cost the earth and will reduce your billsSam McBrideOpinionBasic, inexcusable failures mean that recyclable items are being dumpedAsk the experts: Pollution charges to cut congestionLatestAnother  Covid deaths recorded in last weekEndangered baby rhino born at Czech zoo is named Kyiv in honour of UkraineBelfast Giants ready to make Challenge Cup dream a reality, claim David Goodwin and Adam Keefe ahead of finalITV to broadcast fundraising concert for UkrainePolish, Czech and Slovenian leadersfrom mission of support to Ukraine,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Our direct competitors in the Republic of Ireland are dealing with such signicant applications much more efficiently. This is a major consideration for companies deciding where to invest.”Alliance MLA Andrew Muir said the delays point to a “systemic problem” at the heart of DfI, which “ought to be leading as a role model in planning matters, but instead is more like a black hole where key planning applications disappear for determination to be delayed for years”.“Nothing less than radical reform is needed to ensure the voices of communities are better heard and applications not left sitting stuck in the system without a decision to reject or approve,” he added.DfI said: “The department is working closely with key stakeholders in a number of ways to improve processes and increase the efficiency of the planning system to ensure that planning applications are processed in a timely manner. “A review of the implementation of the Planning Act has been completed. In addition, the department, as part of a collaborative project with  councils, will be delivering a new planning IT system next year which will improve the submission and processing of planning applications.“A planning engagement partnership has also been established to look at how to enhance the quality and depth of community engagement in the planning process at both the regional and local planning levels.“It is hoped that the collective improvements delivered from this work will improve processes and increase the efficiency of the planning system across the board.”Related topicsAndrew MuirDepartment for InfrastructureNichola MallonMore On Andrew MuirAlliance MLAs believe recorded vote was required for key climate bill amendmentMost NI schools have not had to move to remote learning despite Covid-related absences, says Education Minister PremiumBids for extra funding for Northern Ireland road repairs hit -year low PremiumViewpointOpinionSkimping on road repairs must stopDUP is slammed over £m of extra funding now ‘in limbo’Most ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerUnionists hail government U-turn over ‘United Kingdom’ to ‘Great Britain’ customs switchNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreUUP leader ‘too unwell’ to attend St Patrick’s Day events in WashingtonTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayMoral questions raised over use of Russian coal in Northern Ireland PlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest Northern IrelandAlex KaneOpinionDisagreements are only going to grow as unionism heads into election in fractured stateJohn Walsh appointed new Chief Executive of Belfast City CouncilNorthern Ireland author Sue Divin shortlisted for prestigious Carnegie AwardFlybe selects Belfast City Airport as its second base of operations in UKBelfast principal fears for pupilsHoliday Hunger scheme endsLatestRoyal Collection swords withdrawn from Moscow exhibitionUpdated Online Safety Bill will be ‘world-leading’, Culture Secretary saysAnother  Covid deaths recorded in last weekEndangered baby rhino born at Czech zoo is named Kyiv in honour of UkraineBelfast Giants ready to make Challenge Cup dream a reality, claim David Goodwin and Adam Keefe ahead of final,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

My god-daughter Lily likes to call me uncle Hagrid.“I do get askedI would like to shave it off for charity, but that’s never going to happen. I know what I look like underneath it - bowling ball comes to mind! No, it’s staying, I’ll stick to doing the half-marathons for charity.“Anyway, my son Thomas says it’s the only thing that’s cool about me.

For Aodhan, keeping it trim is a daily routine of essential oils and conditioner.He said: “It gets the works every day. You suffer for the success. It’s a daily shampoo, conditioner, oil and balm experience to keep it up to scratch.“It always give people something to talk about. It has a le of its own and has given me a fair few nicknames over the years. I remember being introduced at an academic event recently as the Brian Blessed of Brexit. That was quite an honour.”It might be an evening toasting his beard recognitions with a Guinness, but Aodhan said he won’t let the success go to his head.“There won’t be anything crazy like dying it green for St Patrick’s Day. It’s had a few makeover over the years. It was a cheesy goatee for a while, I’m sure it won#t mind me mentioning that, so it’s had an interesting and eventful le.”Previous winners of The Beard Liberation Front, the informal network of beard wearers, include SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, who didn’t make the cut for the final this year.Keith Flett of the Beard Liberation Front said: “The poll is specically about the impact the beard of an inidual has made in Irish public le and no other factor.“Aodhan Connolly is to be congratulated on being the first person to win consecutive titles.

Kilroot power station said that shipment was not for it, and it last brought in Russian coal on th February. The power station, which dominates the northern shoreline of Belfast Lough just east of Carrickfergus, is our last coal-fired electricity generation plant and is due to close next year.Read MoreUkrainian refugee scheme: Vital that sponsors in Northern Ireland are properly checked, warns anti-slavery expertUp to £m of RHI money may go unspent by StormontHowever, it is still key to keeping the lights on, and has been called upon more in recent years due to problems at other power stations and unusually calm days reducing wind power generation.Coal was Russia’s third most valuable export by value in , bringing in £.bn. Northern Ireland was the only UK region to see coal-fired electricity generation increase that year, accounting for % of all electricity.Energy imports from Russia have not been banned, but have come under scrutiny due to revulsion at Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the escalation of the war through the targeting of civilians.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Kilroot’s position appears similar to that of Shell, which bought Russian oil — entirely legally — days into the Ukraine war, but backtracked under huge public pressure and promised not to do so again.Read MoreMalachi O#Doherty:OpinionMy utility bills now cost £ a week. Pensioners are in big troubleHowever, Kilroot’s situation is complicated by what it says is a requirement in its licence to buy Russian coal for environmental reasons, because it is low-sulphur, and thus somewhat reduces air pollution when burned.!forfort[r].style.e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"When Stormont’s Department for the Economy, which is responsible for electricity policy, was askedit believed environmental rules should be relaxed to allow Kilroot to burn dirtier coal, it initially washed its hands of the matter, saying: “The department does not have responsibility for environmental rules. This is the responsibility of DAERA Northern Ireland Environment Agency .”That answer came despite the RHI Inquiry recommending Stormont stopped operating in silos and behaved coherently as a single government entity.However, Kilroot’s owner then told the Belfastit had been meeting the department, NIEA, electricity grid operator SONI and the Utility Regulator to discuss this issue since the crisis began. That was put to the Department for the Economy and to Edwin Poots’ Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, which is responsible for NIEA.But there was no response at the time of going to press.EP Kilroot, a subsidiary of Czech company Energetický, which owns the plant, said it “condemns the indefensible aggression and actions by Russia”.It added that it “complies with all UK sanctions and associated regulations in relation to Russia”, and stressed there were “signicant stock levels of coal on the Kilroot site at present”.It said: “We have contingency plans in place for alternative sources of coal supply. “This plan requires changing EP Kilroot’s permit, which currently prevents us from using coals from other countries.“Since the start of the Ukraine crisis, EP Kilroot has chaired a number of roundtable workshops with officials from DfE, NIEA, the Utility Regulator and SONI to urgently address the issues of the current permitting arrangements to enable EP Kilroot to remove its reliance on Russian coal.“If the permitting arrangements are not changed, we believe there will be signicant security of supply risks that SONI will need to manage.”The company claimed there could also be “signicant additional costs” for consumers “depending on the extent to which the coal units are restricted”.When DfE, headed by DUP minister Gordon Lyons, was asked for its view on whether Kilroot should continue to buy Russian coal, the department expressed no preference, and said: “The purchase of coal is a commercial decision taken by EP Kilroot. However, the department will follow the guidance that has been issued by the UK Government in relation to Russian imports.”When asked how much coal stocks were in place at Kilroot, DfE said “this is not a matter for the department”, but SONI would tell itthere was a problem. When asked how much secondary fuel was stored at Kilroot, DfE said that was a matter for the company.SONI said it was “unaware of any immediate risk to coal stock at Kilroot”. It said inspection of fuel stocks was “not a matter for SONI”. It added Kilroot “has a key role to play in the energy transition”, involving the current generators as well as new gas turbines.Belfast Harbour said it was “working closely with shipping agents and relevant partners to implement all of the Government’s legislative sanctions on Russian vessels”, but it would only bar vessels excluded by law, rather than go further.The Utility Regulator said Kilroot was responsible for ensuring it held adequate fuel stocks. It added: “In light of the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we are working with DfE to proactively monitor the situation, and are engaging with EP Kilroot and other key stakeholders on a regular basis about fuel stocks and fuel security arrangements.”Overall imports of coal have generally been falling, but have risen to the point where they are now roughly where they were in , despite the reduction in the use of coal for home-heating and electricity generation.Irish state-owned electricity company ESB said it will not be taking delivery of Russian coal to its Moneypoint power station in Co Clare “for the foreseeable future”. It was reported that members of staff at the River Shannon facility had expressed concerns to management about accepting Russian coal in the current circumstances.On Monday, Andrei Melnichenko, owner of Russia’s biggest coal producer, said publicly that the war in Ukraine was a tragedy that must be stopped.Most ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerUnionists hail government U-turn over ‘United Kingdom’ to ‘Great Britain’ customs switchNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreGrenadiers flute band marches to a dferent beatTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayMoral questions raised over use of Russian coal in Northern Ireland PlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest Northern IrelandNI Retail Consortium’s Aodhan Connolly bristling with joy as he wins Irish Beard of the Year once againAlex KaneOpinionDisagreements are only going to grow as unionism heads into election in fractured stateJohn Walsh appointed new Chief Executive of Belfast City CouncilNorthern Ireland author Sue Divin shortlisted for prestigious Carnegie AwardFlybe selects Belfast City Airport as its second base of operations in UKLatestGovernment’s Homes for Ukraine scheme hard to understand, says refugee charityEddie Howe educating himself over the situation in Saudi Arabia after criticismA timeline of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe’s detention in IranUK journalist Benjamin Hall in ‘good spirits’ as he leaves Ukraine after attackNI Retail Consortium’s Aodhan Connolly bristling with joy as he wins Irish Beard of the Year once again,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurneyStaff ReporterMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailUnionists have welcomed a climbdown by the Government over customs regulations that proposed changing all mentions of “the United Kingdom” to “Great Britain” — deliberately omitting Northern Ireland.Sky News reported that Foreign Secretary and UK Brexit negotiator Liz Truss had ordered officials to investigate how the statutory instrumentwas allowed to get to that point without “proper political scrutiny”.In multiple amendments to the The Customs Regulations , it was proposed that instead of using the words “the United Kingdom” that “Great Britain” should be used instead.The Government had presented the amendments as minor and insignicant and would ensure NI-GB trade could “continue smoothly”.The move provoked uproar online, as critics noted that this would directly contradict the Government’s position on the Northern Ireland Protocol by entrenching it further.Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said he thought the initial move was “reprehensible by this Tory Government”.“Why on earth would we trust them, where is the sense in handing power to them ” he asked.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “We must stand our ground and represent the people of Northern Ireland within the Union — not give up for political expediency.”Conservative MP Steve Baker said Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement “makes clear that Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the UK.

Credit: Liam McBurney PA WireSam McBrideTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailStormont is on course to waste at least £m — and perhaps as much as £m — over the next  years due to its failure to find a way to spend Treasury funding made available to Northern Ireland for subsidising renewable heat.As revealed by the Belfastlast week, £m has already been wasted in this way and there is no sign of the Department for the Economy producing an alternative proposal for how it can spend the money.However, new figures show the vast scale of the waste aheadthe situation remains unaltered. In response to a Freedom of Information request from the Renewable Heat Association— which represents most RHI claimants — the department said that it was now on course to underspend by around £m. However, those figures only cover expenditure until , yet the GB RHI scheme — from whose budget Northern Ireland’s share of money for renewable heat is derived — has been extended and will not now close until .Based on that longer duration for the GB scheme, RHANI has calculated that Northern Ireland’s underspend may be closer to £m.Read MoreCriticism as Queen’s University Belfast ‘spends over £k’ on Amazon during pandemicThe hidden RHI scandal of how Stormont wasted £m in green energy subsidiesThe department said that it “will explore the potential to utilise any available [Treasury] funds in support of alternative or additional actions to decarbonise heat”. However, there is still no suggestion that this work has reached an advanced stage nor even that it will be possible because the Executive remains unable to decide how to handle existing RHI claimants.Those claimants were promised unalterable payments for  years but once the calamitous scale of the RHI overspend became apparent, Stormont abandoned that promise and retrospectively slashed their payments, meaning the actual overspend was £.m.That decision made them far less well rewarded than their counterparts in Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland, which recently launched its own version of RHI — putting Northern Irish businesses at a competitive disadvantage.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Sources within the DUP suggest that the party is split on how to handle the situation. Former leader Arlene Foster — the minister who set up the disastrous scheme but then said she was “accountable but not responsible” for the mess which followed — had endorsed a policy of throwing all RHI claimants out of the scheme, paying them a fraction of what they were originally promised as compensation. Sinn Fein has also endorsed this policy, but other DUP figures believe it is unfair to those claimants who entered the scheme in good faith, took on huge loans at the suggestion of its minister and government officials, and who did not abuse RHI.There is another factor which might explain the decision not to spend such a vast sum of money. The retrospective cuts to subsidies which had been guaranteed were immediately challenged in court by claimants. However, that process has moved tortoise-like over the last five years and has not yet gone to the Supreme Court. That case is just one of several RHI legal actions, the outcome of which the department cannot be certain.It may be that its decision not to launch a new green heat scheme is a way of hedging against the possibility that the original scheme is reinstated and it faces a vast compensation bill.Whatever the reason, it is having an increasingly stark impact. As oil and gas prices soar, renewables are among the cheapest alternatives — but have high up-front costs to install, which is why subsidies are in place where across the UK and Ireland.RHANI executive chairman Andrew Trimble said: “If civil servants had not removed  words from the national legislation on renewable heat when the NI legislation was implemented, then today we would have a strong, sustainable, environmentally friendly renewable heat sector. We would be contributing to our pathway to net zero and have a vastly reduced reliance on fossil fuels — with their polluting emissions reduced by %.”He said that Stormont could solve the problem by reinstating the missing  words — essentially replicating the GB scheme, with cost controls, something he said “could solve the political problems that Stormont and the department have created for themselves and for the people of Northern Ireland”.Mr Trimble highlighted that in , a Commons committee inquiry branded the department’s actions “a raw deal”, but the department had repeatedly failed to help genuine claimants suffering as a result of their broken promises.Related topicsDepartment for the EconomyThe Executive OfficeArlene FosterSinn FéinClimate ChangeMore On Department for the Economy‘No plans’ to ration NI’s energy over supply fearsDepartment​​ of Economy slammed over Covid spend PremiumEpidemic Belfast: Podcast takes a scalpel to our medical pastCost of living crisis leads to .% slump in retail footfall PremiumEconomy is being distorted by Invest NI focusing on Belfast, claims MLAMost ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerUnionists hail government U-turn over ‘United Kingdom’ to ‘Great Britain’ customs switchNew dining and nightle hotspot planned for ‘neglected’ Belfast district as £m ploughed into city centreUUP leader ‘too unwell’ to attend St Patrick’s Day events in WashingtonTop VideosPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlayMoral questions raised over use of Russian coal in Northern Ireland PlayA fish supper in Belfast could soon hit £, Fish City owner warns Latest PoliticsAlex KaneOpinionDisagreements are only going to grow as unionism heads into election in fractured stateNorthern Ireland births, deaths and marriages can now be registered in IrishMLAs who tried to cut rents will actually force them up, claims estate agents’ bodyNew Civil Service chief silent over whistleblower caseBelfast taxi driver fears any rise in fares could drive customers awayLatestUK journalist Benjamin Hall in ‘good spirits’ as he leaves Ukraine after attackNI Retail Consortium’s Aodhan Connolly bristling with joy as he wins Irish Beard of the Year once againMan Utd forward Anthony Elanga included in Sweden squad for the first timeNazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe flies back to UK following her release by IranEngland hand Yorkshire seamer Matthew Fisher surprise Test debut,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

has been detained since , her MP has said.Both Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe and fellow dual-national detainee Anoosheh Ashoori are believed to be heading to Tehran airport to leave the country.Tulip Siddiq, Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe’s MP in Hampstead and Kilburn, wrote on Twitter: “Nazanin is at the airport in Tehran and on her way home.”The Foreign Office has not commented on the reports and earlier Boris Johnson said negotiations about Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe were “moving forward” but “going right up to the wire”.There is still nervousness in Whitehall about the situation, with sources stressing the pair will not be free until they are actually on a plane out of Iran.Ms Zaghari-Ratclfe’s sister-in-law echoed that anxiety, telling the BBC the family would not believe she was free until she was in the air.Richard’s sister Rebecca Ratclfe said: “It feels like we are on the home run now but until she leaves that airport we can’t quite believe it.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming

Almost three million refugees have fled Ukraine, the fastest exodus in modern times.The Ukrainian president is no stranger to Congress, having played a central role in Donald Trump’s first impeachment. As president, Trump was accused of withholding security aid to Ukraine as he pressured Zelensky to dig up dirt on political rival Biden.Zelensky spoke on the giant screen to many of the same Republican lawmakers who declined to impeach or convict Trump, but are among the bipartisan groundswell in Congress now clamouring for military aid to Ukraine.Invoking Shakespeare’s hero last week, Zelensky asked the British House of Commons whether Ukraine is “to be or not to be”. On Tuesday, he appealed to “Dear Justin” as he addressed the Canadian parliament and prime minister, Justin Trudeau.Zelensky called on European Union leaders at the start of the war to do the politically unthinkable and fast-track Ukraine’s membership — and he has continued to push for more help to save his young democracy than world leaders have so far pledged to do.Biden has insisted there will be no US troops on the ground in Ukraine and has resisted Zelensky’s relentless pleas for warplanes as too risky, potentially escalating into a direct confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia.“Direct conflict between Nato and Russia is World War Three,” Biden has said.Congress has already approved . billionin military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine, and the newly announced security aid will come from that allotment, which is part of a broader bill that Biden signed into law on Tuesday.

He asked that that all Mournes area councillors are consulted before anything is agreed for this summer in Newcastle.ldquoThere is a substantial amount of money available and Mournes councillors should have a massive say in what happens in Newcastle this year, he added, with his suggestion backed by Cllr Leeanne McEvoy.Cllr Owen proposed that a firm commitment should be made to include the Festival of Flight in the councilrsquos events calendar for next year.She said she had been contacted by a number of business owners and aviation enthusiasts who were concerned that this yearrsquos festival had been cancelled and hoped that it will proceed next summer.Council deputy chief executive Dorinnia Carville said it would be would be premature to determine the events programme for   ahead of finding out how much it would cost.The council official said the organisation had to go through the rates process each year and look at budgets thereafter.Several weeks ago, it was confirmed that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight would not go ahead due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the coronavirus pandemic.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and was also grounded in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down on the Farm book shows importance of museum collections detailing rich history  ","story":"lsquoI SAW the man jump out of the group and grasp the handles of the plough.

While museums are about objects, those objects have no signicance without people.People make things for particular purposes they use them, they value them, they discard them, they contemplate them. Museums try to understand objects in order to reach the peoplebehind them, understand their lives and so add meaning to our own.Local museums are concerned with all aspects of their communities. Their collections represent the inheritance, the culture, and the trust of their communities.Down County Museum has the largest collection of objects relating to farming in Ulster outside the national museums.Through the generosity of iniduals and families it has acquired not only the complete equipment of two of the last horse-powered farms in the county but a fine example of an early Ferguson tractor, with an invention which not only revolutionised agriculture but brought recognition to its County Down inventor throughout the world.A host of other items represent the history of a basic industry and developing way of le in County Down, from a wooden plough from Mourne to a donkey-powered milk churn from Ballyroney to the first reaper and binder in the area, to hay sweeps, rakes and potato diggers, scythes, rope twisters, turnip cutters, barn fans, churns, butter pats, sheep shears, horse harness, slipes, carts, Young Farmersrsquo Club trophies and records, and valuable medals given for agricultural improvements on the iable soils of County Down.We should not forget that we build on what has gone before and that is as true of our most important industry as of any other.One object which is almost entirely forgotten was the block-wheeled car, with solid wooden wheels, which was the ubiquitous load carrier before the introduction of the large-wheeled lsquoScotch cartrsquo in the s.The agricultural census of  recorded  of these lsquocarsrsquo in the  townlands of the south Ards alone.

","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest secured their spot in the semi-final stages of the Harry Clarke Cup after they dramatically defeated a favoured Ardglass side on Saturday.Despite trailing by two goals with less than five minutes left on the clock, Forest managed to force extra-time, and then penalties, following a bizarre conclusion to the  minutes that ended with a red card and a fairytale finish.Sean Dornan was the hero between the sticks in the shootout after saving two separate Ardglass efforts while converting his chance from the spot for good measure.To add further to the drama, Dornan was initially outfield for Forest before swapping positions with lsquokeeper Brian McVeigh a minute before the final whistle of extra-time sounded.It was a sunny yet bitterly cold Ardglass venue but that didnrsquot deter things from immediately heating up on the pitch as both teams sought to gain the upper hand early.However, it was the home side who would take the lead within the opening ten minutes when striker Michael Magee struck the ball into the net from close range.This lead would be short-lived as the visitors penned Ardglass back into their own half and soon Castlewellan were rewarded for their relentless attacking.A quickly played pass across the box was met by Forest forward Shane Mooney, who made no mistake with his right footed finish beyond the outstretched arms of Ardglass custodian Mark Armstrong.Chances followed for the visitors, including a Sean Dornan effort that cracked the outside of the post from range and an opportunity for striker Scott Kinley, which quickly diminished after he took too much time on the ball.However, Ardglass refused to be bullied for a prolonged period of time from a side a ision below in the Newcastle League and often launched some dangerous looking counterattacks.One such breakaway ended with Shane Teggart earning his Ardglass side a corner which led to a goalmouth scramble before the ball was headed off the line and away from danger.Ardglass began to find their feet and found more success up front thanks to the probing runs of marksman Magee, who was giving the Castlewellan defence plenty to think about.The Ardglass number nine was unfortunate to see his free-kick effort saved at the second time of asking, but he did give his side the chance to go in front when his nty footwork inside the Forest box resulted in a mistimed tackle and a penalty awarded.Stephen Deegan stepped up a coolly dispatched the spot kick, sending Castlewellan custodian Brian McVeigh the opposite direction in the process.Castlewellan continued to battle with Donagh Steele in the middle of the park having a particularly notable performance as he chased down every loose ball available.Despite their good work, Forest may count themselves fortunate not to go into the break further behind as the usually clinical Magee fluffed his lines from ten yards, missing a golden opportunity for Ardglass.The drama of the first half carried onto the second and in a matter of minutes the referee was forced to make another potentially game changing decision.Once again, the hosts released Magee into the danger area although this time he had Castlewellan captain Aidan Dornan hot on his heels.The move ended with Magee on the ground with his hands in the air appealing for a penalty, however, this time appeals were swtly waved off.The contest quickly turned into a feisty affair as Ardglass looked to overrun their counterparts by sending bodies forward in waves of attacks.Jordan Finnegan saw his snapshot smartly saved by Forest lsquokeeper McVeigh before strike partner Magee saw another one of his efforts tipped wide by the impressive Castlewellan number one.Midway through the half Castlewellan were afforded a seldom opportunity, but Sean Dornan opted to pass when he maybe should have tried his luck at goal instead.Soon after, a punt upfield from the Ardglass defence evaded the heads of the opposition, including lsquokeeper McVeigh, and almost resulted in a rather comedic goal.However, the Castlewellan defence recovered just in the nick of time to avoid any red faces.With  minutes left of the , Ardglass would finally add to their tally after a sumptuous dead ball delivery from Neil Teggart lofted onto the head of team-mate Malachy Crangle, who directed his effort into the net.Castlewellan knew the clock was against them but firmly pushed for a way back into the tie. Rossa McCartan was introduced to the fray off the bench in what proved to be a decisive move from Castlewellan head coach Conall Burns.With a minute of regulation time to go, McCartan danced his way down the line and into the Ardglass box where he was adjudged to be brought down unfairly.Forest striker Mooney converted the penalty to notch his second goal of the match but there was little belief from the surrounding spectators that there would be enough time for another opportunity.In what was seemingly one last throw of the dice, Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick inside their own half and players gathered at the edge of the opposing -yard line waiting for the delivery.However, before the free-kick could be taken, some roughhousing from both sides would end with Ardglass substitute Aidan Watson being shown the red card after he seemingly lost his discipline and kicked out at the opposition.A bizarre series would follow, as the initial free-kick was then brought forward to the -yard line where Watson committed his foul, and from here Castlewellan would take full advantage.Sean Dornan struck his lowly driven effort beneath the jumping Ardglass wall, and goalkeeper Mark Armstrong could only momentarily ert the ball away from goal before the onrushing Callum McCabe would tap-in to draw the sides level.With that, the final whistle of regulation time was blown and extra-time was set to commence.To both sidersquos credit, the intensity of the match remained but neither manufactured any real clear cut chances.Ardglass striker Magee picked up a yellow card but the most notable move of extra-time came from the Castlewellan management, whoopted to swap midfielder Sean Dornan for goalkeeper McVeigh a minute before the penalty shootout.This would prove decisive as Dornan broke Ardglass hearts and saved two penalties, giving his Castlewellan side a memorable victory and place in the last four of the Harry Clarke Cup.Following the dramatic encounter, Dornan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe were low on numbers coming down here and we probably werenrsquot as strong as we could be, he said.ldquoBut the credit has to go to the boys, we worked hard and it worked out for us.ldquoWe went - down but we battled hard, got a penalty and a fluky goal.He added: ldquoThe Harry Clarke Cup is blown wide open, Ardglass was probably the favourites and we knocked them out so itrsquos anyones now.Ardglass: M Armstrong, C Kearney, M Crangle, N Teggart, C OrsquoShea, M Rooney , S Deegan, SP Halpin, M Magee, J Finnegan, S Teggart.Subs: S Dorrian, A Watson, J Deegans, A OrsquoShea.Yellow card: M MageeRed card: A WatsonCastlewellan: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, A Dornan , D Gilmore, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, S Kinley, J Murnin.Subs: C McVeigh, R McCartan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  March 11%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash Work has begun on the first phase of a major agricultural marketing centre for the Downpatrick area.Diggers moved in this week to begin excavating a ten-acre site for a co-operative project which is being seen as essential to the future of the local farming community.A pound, livestock mart will form the first stage of an ambitious scheme by the Downpatrick Co-Operative Marketing Centre, a limited company which has been set up by more than  local farmers.A covered sale yard and ancillary buildings on the Bonecastle Road site are expected to be finished in time for trading to begin by late July.

The extension of the scheme sends a strong message of the important contribution of the small business sector.Last month, Newry, Mourne and Down Council imposed a .% rates rise to finance its poundm budget, with the hike the second lowest increase of any of the provincersquos  local authorities.Rates are made up of two parts mdash the regional rate and the district rate.The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by local councils and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year they have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both.Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of homes and businesses by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.Key factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the councilrsquos own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.As a result of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos rates increase, local communities are set to share a poundm funding boost in the new financial year.The organisation said it recognises that communities have been hit hard over the past number of years, outlining plans for poundm of financial assistance grants for community and voluntary organisations.In addition, the local authority will also manage the establishment of the Peace Plus Partnership as well as the submission and delivery of the Peace Plus Local Authority Action Plan worth around poundm.The action plan will provide priority projects on a cross-community basis, resulting in shared and inclusive local services, facilities and spaces and make a ldquosignicant and lasting contribution to peace and reconciliation for the whole community.In addition, pound.m will be invested on a new fleet of over  modern and more efficient vehicles across a range of services including refuse collection, district cleansing and parks and grounds maintenance with the new vehicles expected to arrive before the end of this year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Sense have been at  the core of Páuric’s  development and they have done a lot for us  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman braved the winds and rain last month to walk  miles in aid of the disability charity, Sense.Janine Laverty was inspired to take on Sensersquos Run For challenge to give back to the charity which supports her disabled son.So far Janine has raised an amazing total of over pound, through her challenge, but she is aiming to raise pound, in total.Participants challenged themselves to run or walk a distance of their choosing over the month of February.Janine finished her -mile target on February , completing her challenge with a seaside walk.She undertook the walk to support the charity which has meant so much to her family since her youngest son Paacuteuric, , was born premature and has cerebral palsy, developmental delay and dficulties with his vision.Family and friends have rallied around Janine , joining her on walks and generously donating to Sense.Sense services in Northern Ireland have supported Paacuteuric since he was an infant, providing key interventions such as play therapy, music therapy and guide dog days which boosted his development.Janine also credits Sense with providing some of her most precious family memories support from the charity allowed her to take both her sons swimming at the same time, and the family have attended fun-filled Sense days out to places including Ark Open Farm, Armagh Planetarium and Jungle Northern Ireland.Janine explained: ldquoSense Northern Ireland have been at the core of Paacuteuricrsquos development and they have done an awful lot for us.

In the current situation that is just not possible, he said.ldquoThe only way for people to get out is through the only UK embassy open in Lviv and how are people are meant top get there when they canrsquot leave their own towns without the risk of being bombed Mr Johnston added that he and his we and their children, Liza and Jamie, were frustrated that their family members could be just one plane flight away from safetythey could get the necessary visa, orthat could be waived in the urgent circumstances.He said: ldquoWe are worried aboutthe possibility of Alexander being coned to fight and we are getting reports that landmines have been set around the city.ldquoWhile we are all worried, Iryna has been remarkable throughout all of this and has been really strong but we feel that there is very little we can do.Mr Johnston said that they were in despair of the UKrsquos stance in welcoming Ukrainian refugees but still making them apply for visas.ldquoThe south of Ireland opened up to refugees visa-free which is great but that means we still couldnrsquot bring them to our home as they would be in UK territory.He and his family visited Mariupol for six weeks last summer as it has already proved dficult for his mother-in-law to get a visa to travel to them.ldquoMariupol is such a beautul city. They had spent so much money on the city and now itrsquos ruined.The couple met in Ukraine while Mr Johnston, a flutist, was performing in cruise ships and his we was a concert pianist.To sign the petition to waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees coming into the UK visit https:petition.parliament.uk petitions ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":null,"title":"latest","story":"Undefined component: AdRowTaboolaHealth Testing times can give us strength, says Queen By The NewsroomOpinion Ruth Dudley Edwards: Sinn Fein cannot erase its record of hostility towards Nato Ruth Dudley EdwardsOpinion Jim Allister: Appeal Court confirms that the NI Protocol dismantles the Union LettersOpinion No wonder Baroness Hoey feels so betrayed by outworkings of  Belfast deal Editorial Hoey, the former Labour MP, speaks to the media outside the High Court in Belfast, after the dismissal of her appeal against a ruling that NI Protocol is lawful.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Kymin in Beach Road is currently empty, but the Vale of Glamorgan council plans to run the building in a similar way to the Pier Pavilion, which it took over last year and refurbished.The Vale council previously let the Kymin to Penarth Town Council. But after a funding dispute, the lease ended and the Vale planned to sell off the building on a long lease, possibly as a restaurant or hotel.After a public backlash the council performed a U-turn last summer and dropped the plans. Now council bosses have suggested the building could be used for business meetings, open-air theatre, community fairs, weddings, and food festivals.Plans are already underway to host productions this summer of Peter Pan, Pirates of Penzance, and a Midsummer Night’s Dream. Council bosses welcomed the progress during a cabinet meeting on Monday, March .Cllr Kathyrn McCaffer, cabinet member for leisure, arts and culture, said the initial refurbishment work includes making the building safe and protected from wind and rain.She said: “We’re investing to make sure the building stays watertight and secure and is fit for purpose. We have a great relationship with a couple of local community groups who are already using the grounds of the Kymin, which is really encouraging.”Since the Pavilion reopened in April last year, after the council took it over, the building has brought in an extra £, income from the cafe, cinema screenings, weddings and art sales. The building has hosted events for Halloween, Christmas, arts and crafts, and carols.Cllr Peter King, cabinet member for neighbourhood services and transport, said the council took the Pavilion on from the charity which used to run it “at the most challenging time” yet now the building is making money for the council.He said: “The previous organisation failed to make a financial success of operating the Pavilion and frankly ended in a bit of a mess. It defaulted back to us as the landlord, and it came to us at the most challenging time you could imagine for any business or organisation..remove“And yet we have managed to turn things around, despite all those restraints of lockdown, and we’re reporting what can only be described as a successful community facility—and one that has produced a financial surplus.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBoth Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe and fellow dual-national detainee Anoosheh Ashoori are believed to be heading to Tehran airport to leave the country.Tulip Siddiq, Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe’s MP in Hampstead and Kilburn, wrote on Twitter: “Nazanin is at the airport in Tehran and on her way home.”The Foreign Office has not commented on the reports and earlier Boris Johnson said negotiations about Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe were “moving forward” but “going right up to the wire”.There is still nervousness in Whitehall about the situation, with sources stressing the pair will not be free until they are actually on a plane out of Iran.Ms Zaghari-Ratclfe’s sister-in-law echoed that anxiety, telling the BBC the family would not believe she was free until she was in the air.Richard’s sister Rebecca Ratclfe said: “It feels like we are on the home run now but until she leaves that airport we can’t quite believe it.” vw,vw,px, px\"Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe with her husband Richard Ratclfe and their daughter Gabriella when she was a baby Ms Siddiq said that, during her conversation with constituent Mr Ratclfe, he had stressed that his we was still “under the authority of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard” but that he could “smell freedom”.The Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn told Sky News the family had “no information about a deal” amid reports in Iran that the UK has paid a £ million debt owed to Iran.The apparent breakthrough will bring an end to the ordeal for Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe, which began in  when she was detained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard at Imam Khomeini airport after a holiday visit to Iran where she introduced her daughter Gabriella to her parents.Nazanin is at the airport in Tehran and on her way home.I came into politics to make a dference, and right now I’m feeling like I have.More details to follow. #FreeNazanin— Tulip SiddiqMarch , There have been signs of progress in delicate negotiations between the UK and Iran in recent days.But Mr Johnson, during a trip to the Middle East, was careful not to elaborate further when speaking to reporters on Tuesday.A glimmer of optimism for -year-old Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe came a day earlier when Ms Siddiq said her British passport had been ed.Mr Johnson confirmed a British negotiating team was working in Tehran to secure the release of dual nationals, while Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe at the time remained at her family home in the Iranian capital.“I really don’t think I should say much more, I’m sorry, although things are moving forward,” he told broadcasters at the Emirates Palace hotel in Abu Dhabi.“I shouldn’t really say much more right now just because those negotiations continue to be under way

is possible they are linked to a £ million debt dating back to the s owned to Iran by the UK.Iranian state media on Wednesday said the UK has “settled a long-overdue debt” to Tehran, paving the way for dual-national detainees to be allowed to travel to the airport with British officials.The UK Government has accepted it should pay the “legitimate debt” for an order of , Chieftain tanks that was not fulfilled after the shah was deposed and replace by a revolutionary regime.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told Sky News on Wednesday that it is a “priority to pay the debt that we owe to Iran”.The Tehran regime remains under strict sanctions, however, which has complicated efforts to repay the money. vw,vw,px, px\"Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has been praised for her efforts in bidding for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe’s release Ms Siddiq praised Ms Truss’ efforts in bidding for the release of her constituent, saying it took a female foreign secretary “who actually did something”.She told Times Radio: “When we started speaking to Liz Truss from very early on, it did seem like she was making some sort of plan to pay back the debt.“Andshe’s managed to make it happen, then it’s quite an achievement.”Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe served five years in prison after her arrest in .She was later convicted of plotting the overthrow of Iran’s government, a charge that she, her supporters and human

Two hundred and thirty three years later a preacher whose le is not dissimilar to that of John Wesley has arranged a Revival Convention from March -. Evangelist John Weir from Belfast’s Donegall Road has a well travelled ministry throughout Ireland and further afield. He will be chairman throughout the two weeks of meetings. The convention will take the form of visiting guest speakers from ious churches. They will relate the stories of memorable Christian revivals in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland that have influenced the spiritual standing of generations.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

He will share the story of the  Revival, which commenced in Kells, stemming from the prayers of four young men who met each Friday evening from September  in the Old Schoolhouse there. They each carried bundles of turf for the fire along with their Bibles. By  their prayers were answered and churches had great numbers of people seeking God, so much so that the First Presbyterian Church in Ahoghill had to be vacated. Such was the crush of , people trying to get in, one of the pillars holding up the left side of the gallery sank several inches into the floor. Throughout Ulster the towns experienced the effect of the revival with less crime and diminishing trade in public houses with some closing. People kneeled by the roadside and in fields calling on God for mercy. It is believed that over , souls were converted during this spiritual awakening. Reverend Duncan Campbell with the two elderly sisters who prayed for Revival in the Isle of LewisThe second speaker on March  will be travelling from Strabane, Reverend Caldwell Darragh, an octogenarian who has preached in Lisburn CWU over the years. His task will be to relate the amazing time of God’s Blessing which was outpoured in the Hebrides, beginning on the Isle of Lewis and spreading to other islands in the region during  to . As a young man having trained as a Bible student Caldwell Darragh knew Reverend Duncan Campbell whose ministry God used and people sought the Lord. Again this was in answer to prayer, this time by two elderly sisters Peggy and Christine Smith, one with arthritis and the other blind. They were burdened for the lost and prayed regularly into the night hours. They held on to a promise from Isaiah : “I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground.” Their intercession sparked off the revival as others also prayed. Duncan Campbell recalled the first night he arrived and preached in the church. It was a good meeting but nothing happened and he pronounced the benediction. As he was leaving the door opened and the local blacksmith announced “Mr.Campbell something wonderful has happened! Outside there were some  people waiting. Where had they come from  Duncan Campbell believed that God swept in – the power of the Holy Ghost! Revival had begun. What happened in the following years was a community where the overwhelming Presence of God was known. In some places supernatural ‘Heavenly Singing’ was heard. One minister writing about the Revival stated “You met God on the meadow and mooreland. You met Him in the homes of the people. God seemed to be everywhere!” On the first Saturday of the Conventionlocal minister Reverend Roger Higginson from Lisburn Free Presbyterian Church will share with the congregation ‘Revival in the days of Reverend W P Nicholson’ who was born in Bangor, Co Down. He was nicknamed ‘Tornado of the Pulpit’ and was known for his forthright and sometimes humorous sayings but his preaching was used by God to reach people and they responded in repentance, finding new le in Christ. A large number of men attended his meetings including the shipyard workers who marched to church in Belfast in their working clothes to hear him. This year will see the one hundredth anniversary of Reverend Nicholson’s visit to Lisburn where his meetings were packed out. His mission in  commenced in the Orange Hall, but space proved inadequate and had to be moved to Railway Street Presbyterian Church. Such was the crowd that the window sills served as seats. At that period of time in Lisburn there was little or no court cases as crime had dropped to an all time low. In the twenties the province was on the brink of civil war and it is believed that this was prevented by the spiritual influence in the country. W P Nicholson’s last gospel mission in Lisburn CWU was in May  seventeen months prior to his passing. His motto was John : “He must increase, but I must decrease.” The increase of souls for Christ was the aim of W P Nicholson and is the reason Christians pray for revival today. During the second week of the convention on Tuesday, March  the location and history of a past Revival will move back to Scotland. Mr Trevor Matthews, who served with the Faith Mission for many years, will relate the times of blessing in the early days of the organisation. Founded by John George Govan in  the young people who joined him in the work became known as Pilgrims. The need for “Full Salvation and a clean heart” was their message. Le was not easy as they lived by faith, sometimes in caravans or whatever accommodation was available. They carried out an itinerant ministry in the Highlands. Small villages and hamlets knew times of great blessing when barns, houses and churches were crowded and many found Christ as a personal Saviour. In  J G Govan made his first visit to Belfast. It was the start and Missions began in Ireland. The ongoing work continued in Scotland and it became clear that the Faith Mission needed a training home for their workers. Today the Bible College based in Edinburgh continues to train students from around the world to equip them for Christian service. In  the annual Bangor convention began and from this many more have surrendered their lives to serving the Lord both at home and abroad. On Thursday March  Reverend Billy Park, a retired Independent Methodist Minister will be the speaker. His subject will be ‘Revival in the days of John Wesley’ an intrepid preacher who founded Methodism. He was born in England in  and travelled throughout the land on horseback. When unable to obtain a church to preach in he held meetings in the open air. A tombstone in a graveyard served as his pulpit. On many occasions he was attacked by those who opposed him but this did not detract from the urgency of his message to win people for the Lord and edy Christians in their faith. He travelled to Northern Ireland on several occasions. His journal has several notes on these visits and indicates a sense of humour. However, on his last visit to Lisburn he noted in his journal on June , : “In the evening I was in the new chapel in Lisburn, the largest and best finished in the north of Ireland.” . Over , hymns were written by the Wesleys and are still sung today. One man on fire for God saw the fruit of his labours in the conversion of many. John Wesley’s message lives on, and his heritage is the many Methodist churches throughout the world. On Saturday March , evangelist John Weir will bring the special event to a close. Now known for conducting many Gospel Missions throughout the province where people are being saved, his subject will be ‘The Need for Personal Revival’ endeavouring to promote the importance for Christians to surrender their lives to Christ. The aim of the convention is not only to recall the times of past revivals when God moved in power, but that He is able and willing to bestow again in our time a work of grace, a spiritual awakening that will see many turning to Christ.  Chronicles :  “If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.” Singers will also take part in the convention. On Saturday March  Sarah McMillan will be the soloist and on the final evening Ruth and Paul Agnew will bring duets. Refreshments will be served each evening after the service. All meetings will commence at pm starting with community singing of the old time gospel hymns which were sung during the days of past revivals.
