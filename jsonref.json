The production team has repeatedly offered her various forms of support which she has failed to respond to.‘The negative Press coverage stemmed from Lottie’s language to another candidate, not the actions of the production.’There are some, of course, who would say that it is all fair game —that once you sign up for a reality TV show you have to take whatever comes your way. ‘People have to be reminded that just because I have decided to put myself out there on television doesn’t mean I’m not human,’ says Lottie. ‘There’s criticism and then there’s abuse.‘The sad thing is that generally I really enjoyed the process — but the aftermath has been horrible.’This week, that process came to an on-screen end, when Lottie’s business plan for her ‘socially elite’ country club floundered in the face of a lack of detailed figures. It left finalists Carina and recruitment company owner Scarlett Allen Horton, 32, to battle it out for Lord Sugar’s £250,000 investment.Lottie was, at least, afforded a gracious exit. ‘It didn’t show this on-screen, but Lord Sugar told me that he felt I had taken part in the process five years too early and I think he was right,’ she says.Little chance of her going back for more, of course — those bridges are well and truly burned. Instead, she is trying to focus on moving forward with her business plan — and focusing on the positive. ‘Love it or loathe it, the Lottie Lion brand is pretty well known now,’ she says.Few could argue with that.

The implication of that empty chair on Channel 4 was that Johnson was avoiding the issue. That is not a point for broadcasters to make, but for other politicians to opine.In this campaign, in any event, it certainly wasn’t true of either the PM or the Leader of the Opposition. For the first time in British TV history, we’ve seen the leaders of the two main political parties going head-to-head in US-style debates on prime-time television.Johnson simply chose to do some interviews and not others. That is his right.And following their victory, senior Tories have stayed away from BBC Radio 4’s Today programme too. They are said to regard it as a ‘total waste of time’, a show aimed at ‘a Remain bubble’. That’s their choice to make. It’s a free country. (And I can’t deny that – in the new digital world – the Today programme, which once enjoyed a unique status in British political debate, is losing its impact.)I would expect the producers to exert pressure behind the scenes to get interviews. That’s their right too. But where the BBC and C4 have overstepped the mark is by taking their grievances into the public domain, and misusing their privilege as public service broadcasters to make what amounted to political statements.                         Neil\u0027s monologue quickly racked up thousands of views online and social media was flooded with praise for the broadcaster\u0027s remarksPoliticians are not at the beck and call of broadcasters. Producers can beg and plead for interviews, and exert every pressure short of blackmail – but they do not have a ine right to demand attendance.And when they are snubbed, channels broadcasting on the publicly-owned airwaves must never resort to taunts. That is overtly political behaviour, and it puts the whole basis of our precious broadcasting impartiality at risk.  PM orders license fee review as his ministers shun the Today programmeA shot has been fired across the BBC’s bows after Boris Johnson ordered a review into whether not paying for a TV licence should be a criminal offence.Watching television or the BBC iPlayer without a £154.50-a-year licence currently can lead to a court appearance and a £1,000 fine – or even jail if the fine is not paid.But ministers have argued that prosecutions take up too much court time and the penalties are disproportionate.         Mr Johnson (pictured being greeted by staff as he arrives back at 10 Downing Street on December 13) has ordered a review into whether not paying for a TV license should be a criminal offence. People using BBC iPlayer without a £154.50-a-year licence currently can lead to a court appearance and a £1,000 fineIt comes as ministers revealed plans to boycott Radio 4’s Today programme because Downing Street believes it is ‘stuck in a Remainer, Islington bubble’.A senior Government source said: ‘The BBC and Channel 4 had a terrible election – day after day they were out of sync with where the people are outside London.‘There is no point us going on Today. There is more mileage having ministers on the breakfast sofas or on Radio 5 Live or LBC.’         Radio 4\u0027s Today programme (pictured , presenters on September 19) is \u0027stuck in a Remainer, Islington bubble\u0027 according to ministers which are planning are boycott Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak yesterday announced that the Prime Minister has ‘instructed people to look at’ decriminalising non-payment of licence fees. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘I think that the Government feels strongly, as do I that the BBC is an incredibly important national institution. It plays a very valuable role in our country, in our life.‘I think that things like criminalisation of the fee is something discrete and specific that we can and should look at and we will do that in the first instance.’         Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak has said imposing fares on BBC iPlayer (file image) is \u0027something discrete and specific that we can and should look at and we will do that in the first instance\u0027. Last financial year, 25.8million households had TV licences bringing in £3.6billion to the BBCMr Sunak said there would be wider consideration of the future of TV licences when the current Royal Charter – which sets out the governance of the BBC – comes to an end in December 2027.‘The BBC’s funding settlement is already set out and secure through to 2027,’ he said. ‘I’m not going to sit here and speculate about things that are eight years down the track. But the point is at the moment the main thing to focus on is just the decriminalisation of the licence fee and everything else so the BBC is secure until 2027.‘The media industry is changing. How people consume media is changing and it’s of course right that we continue to look at those things over time.’Last financial year, 25.8million households had TV licences bringing in £3.6billion to the BBC. A review may recommend replacing the existing criminal sanctions for non-payment of the TV licence fee with a civil system of fines. In the run-up to last week’s General Election, Mr Johnson said he was ‘looking at’ abolishing the licence fee altogether. He said that while the Tories were currently ‘not planning to get rid of all TV licence fees’, the current system ‘bears reflection’.         \u0027Not the real world\u0027: The BBC has been accused of being targeted at \u0027the pro-Remain metropolitan bubble in Islington.\u0027 Mishal Hussain is one of the stars of the programme The BBC warned that the change would have an adverse effect on funding for its services by encouraging evasion and could cost it up to £200million in lost revenue. A spokesman said: ‘The Government has already commissioned a QC to take an in-depth look at this matter and he found that “the current system of criminal deterrence and prosecution should be maintained” and that it is fair and value for money to licence fee payers.‘The review also found that non-payment cases accounted for “a minute fraction” – only 0.3 per cent – of court time.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres (pictured at the Madrid convention last week) said he was \u0027disappointed\u0027 by the meeting\u0027s outcome\u0027The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis,\u0027 he said. \u0027We must not give up and I will not give up.\u0027The final declaration cited an \u0027urgent need\u0027 to cut planet-heating greenhouse gases in line with the goals of the landmark 2015 Paris climate change accord.But it fell far short of explicitly demanding that countries submit bolder emissions proposals next year, which developing countries and environmentalists had demanded.The Paris accord established a common goal of keeping temperature increases below 2C, ideally 1.5C by the end of the century.So far, the world is on course for a 3- to 4-C rise, with potentially dramatic consequences for many countries, including rising sea levels and fiercer storms.After two nights of fractious negotiations, delegates in Madrid decided to defer some of the thorniest issues to the next UN climate summit in Glasgow in November.Chile\u0027s Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt, who chaired the meeting, said she was \u0027sad\u0027 no deal had been reached on the rules for international trading in carbon emissions permits.

The 1980s saw a West End smash. Will the new film speak to us today?When Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats appeared in the first week of October 1939, it might have been thought that its author had lost the plot. It was only 17 years since TS Eliot had published The Waste Land, his cryptic lament for the moral and psychic disintegration that both caused and followed the first world war. Now, a mere month into renewed hostilities in Europe, here was Eliot, the man with more claim to cultural authority than almost anyone living, wasting his time (not to mention everyone else’s) with light verse about cats.Practical Cats consists of short verse profiles of 15 rambunctious felines with fanciful names, including Rum Tum Tugger and Growltiger. It stands in a classic tradition of catty nonsense, reaching back through The Owl and the Pussy-Cat (Edward Lear) and the Cheshire Cat (Lewis Carroll) to Christopher Smart’s “My Cat, Jeoffry”, an 18th-century epic that Eliot himself regarded as the Iliad of cat literature. Yet, despite the fact that he had such a pedigree, literary critics of the time couldn’t help feeling that Eliot, who was not only the author of Practical Cats but, by virtue of his job at Faber, its publisher, too, had misjudged the nation’s mood. At this very moment many families were contemplating euthanising their pets for fear of not being able to feed them properly once wartime rationing kicked in. Death and destruction were clearly on their way, and here was one of the country’s leading intellectuals writing stuff for kids. The view that the book was a significant indiscretion was shared in Eliot’s native US where John Holmes of the Boston Evening Transcript snapped that Practical Cats “should have been prevented”.Nor did that judgment change significantly even once the book’s popular success became clear (right from the start it outsold The Waste Land significantly). “Pleasant, inoffensive and unremarkable”, sniffed the distinguished Eliot scholar Burton Raffel, and this remained the dominant view throughout the postwar period. It was Andrew Lloyd Webber’s determination to bring Eliot’s creatures to the stage in 1981 that changed all that. Confronted by the melancholy of the material, critics were jogged into wondering whether there might be more to Cats, practical or otherwise, than meets the eye. Now, with Tom Hooper’s much-anticipated film version starring Taylor Swift and Idris Elba to be released on Friday, it is worth thinking again about the magnetic darkness that keeps us returning to TS Eliot’s feline universe at times of deep disturbance.Initially conceived of throughout the 1930s with his young godchildren in mind, Eliot’s cat land is every bit as bleak as The Waste Land. Both share a sense of chronic disorder, where violence simmers just beneath the surface, regret drowns optimism and wilful self-interest trumps finer feeling every time. Above all, here is the moral grubbiness of what Eliot’s younger friend WH Auden dubbed “a low dishonest decade”.In Eliot’s text Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer are two young thugs who destroy property for the hell of it – dislodging tiles “loose on the roof  Which presently ceased to be water-proofed”, anticipating the blitz by several months. The juvenile delinquents wantonly smash items in the dining room and library (the sites of the civilised body and mind respectively) and think nothing of stealing food from families who can afford it least. Rum Tum Tugger, meanwhile, is a contrarian who takes joy in creating “domestic muddle” just as Macavity, the master criminal, wrecks national security by stealing treaties from the Foreign Office and plans from the Admiralty. Growltiger, “the Terror of the Thames”, is an outlaw who preys on cottagers, canaries, geese, hens and the “bristly Bandicoot that lurks on foreign ships”.If Eliot’s cat book spoke to the terror of the times, it also mapped the continuing disintegration of his personal life. In The Waste Land his unhappy wife Vivienne appears in pleading glimpses. “Stay with me  Speak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak”. But by the time of writing Practical Cats in the early 1930s, the couple were separated. The histrionic Vivienne, who had taken to dressing up in a fascist uniform, pursued Eliot aggressively around London, accompanied by her snappy yorkshire terrier, Polly (Eliot, by contrast, remained a dedicated “cat man”). On several occasions Vivienne and Polly laid siege to “Tom” in the Faber office he would escape by slinking down the backstairs of the Bloomsbury office. It is no wonder, then, that in Practical Cats, dogs appear not as iniduals but as a barking mob, mindless brownshirts reined in only when the Great Rumpus Cat appears and swiftly restores order with nothing more than a “fearfully blazing” look and a warning yawn.This sense that Eliot’s Catland has important things to say to a world falling apart explains why Lloyd Webber set about adapting the book for the musical stage 40 years after its original publication. 1981, just like 1939, was hardly a time when there was much to sing about. It was the year when ferocious riots in Brixton and Toxteth suggested that Britain really was a nation ided. The very posh and the very rich seemed to be having a lot of fun, settling down to watch Brideshead Revisited on the television or else hoping for an invitation to the royal wedding. The markets – we had just learned that word – were apparently going to make us all very rich (or perhaps very poor). Meanwhile many others worried about the sharp swing to the political right – Margaret Thatcher was getting settled, while President Reagan was just getting started. What’s more, in an echo of 1939, by the very next year we would be at war once again, this time with Argentina over the Falkland Islands.So, when the lights went up on stage at the New London theatre on 11 May 1981, and this piece of musical theatre appeared to be set in a broken down post-industrial dump – in which characters are mostly engaged in telling stories about their more glorious pasts and the hopelessness of their futures – it seemed exactly right.Whether Tom Hooper’s new film, which comes out 80 years after the original publication of Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats, will prove as enduring as Lloyd Webber’s original stage production remains to be seen. There have already been murmurs about the way that the dear old 1980s leg-warmers have been replaced by “creepy” digital fur. Swift’s new song “Beautiful Ghosts” may be better even than “Memory” or it may be no good at all. That, really, is not the point. What matters is whether enough of the uncanny anguish of Eliot’s original work remains. Every age gets the Cats it deserves, and what we need, now more than ever, is one with soul.• Kathryn Hughes is writing a book about cats in the Edwardian age."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cad1b76f3ed442e62c8c48158ec981799a25ef3e/0_2521_3970_2383/master/3970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d6b873d68be4e98656fbedf7eafccf2","title":"poem of the week the corn stalk fiddle by paul laurence dunbar","story":"From one of the great black American poets, this harvest song combines formal and vernacular language to potent effectWhen the corn’s all cut and the bright stalks shineLike the burnished spears of a field of goldWhen the field-mice rich on the nubbins dine,And the frost comes white and the wind blows coldThen its heigho fellows and hi-diddle-diddle,For the time is ripe for the corn-stalk fiddle.And you take a stalk that is straight and long,With an expert eye to its worthy points,And you think of the bubbling strains of songThat are bound between its pithy joints –Then you cut out strings, with a bridge in the middle,With a corn-stalk bow for a corn-stalk fiddle.Then the strains that grow as you draw the bowO’er the yielding strings with a practiced hand!And the music’s flow never loud but lowIs the concert note of a fairy band.Oh, your dainty songs are a misty riddleTo the simple sweets of the corn-stalk fiddle.When the eve comes on and our work is doneAnd the sun drops down with a tender glance,With their hearts all prime for the harmless fun,Come the neighbor girls for the evening’s dance,And they wait for the well-known twist and twiddle,More time than tune – from the corn-stalk fiddle.Then brother Jabez takes the bow,While Ned stands off with Susan Bland,Then Henry stops by Milly SnowAnd John takes Nellie Jones’s hand,While I pair off with Mandy Biddle,And scrape, scrape, scrape goes the corn-stalk fiddle.“Salute your partners,” comes the call,“All join hands and circle round,”“Grand train back,” and “Balance all,”Footsteps lightly spurn the ground,“Take your lady and balance down the middle”To the merry strains of the corn-stalk fiddle.So the night goes on and the dance is o’er,And the merry girls are homeward gone,But I see it all in my sleep once more,And I dream till the very break of dawnOf an impish dance on a red-hot griddleTo the screech and scrape of a corn-stalk fiddle.This week we revisit the work of one of the great black American writers, Paul Laurence Dunbar. Poet, novelist and playwright, Dunbar was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1872, to ex-slaves freed after the civil war. His mother struggled hard to finance his early years at school, and, the only African American in his high school, Dunbar was an outstanding student.Though subsequently his routes to higher education and solid employment were obstructed by poverty and prejudice, Dunbar found early fame as a poet, and an enthusiastic readership. But the success had a bitter edge for him, and he complained to his friend, James Weldon Johnson: “I’ve got to write dialect poetry, It is the only way I can get them to listen to me.”Dunbar thought his poetry fell into two categories – the “major” poetry in standard English, underestimated by his readers, and the “minor” dialect poems. His frustration is understandable, but that labelling shouldn’t distract contemporary readers from the quality and importance of his dialect writing. Dunbar is a pioneer in this respect. If we were to trace the story of dialect in anglophone literature from his period to the present day, we’d see how vital a part it has played in revitalising and energising the language of poetry. The use of the vernacular has helped shape many of our current criteria for strong, memorable writing.As well as the poetic writer and the dialect speaker, there is a third voice in Dunbar, in which the “plantation idiom”, as early commentators called it, is ploughed back into verse written primarily in standard English. The Corn-Stalk Fiddle is a terrific example. The idiom is rich and varied. It’s not only that of the celebrating field hands. Dunbar uses the language of the dance call with great effect in his penultimate stanza. Throughout, the vernacular and poetic pair up and give energy and succinctness to this brilliantly realised square dance of a poem.Especially effective is the vividly detailed account of the building of the corn-stalk fiddle. I wasn’t aware such fiddles existed, and, at a first reading, I wondered if that was an underlying message of the poem: for the celebrants, there was access to joy only through fantasy. This thought hovers in the third stanza, perhaps: “And the music’s flow never loud but low  Is the concert note of a fairy band.”But the poem makes clear that the fiddle is a real, carefully made musical instrument. The solo work and the collective, communal activity are seamlessly brought together. But again, at the end, when sleep blurs the speaker’s happy memories into dreams, the note becomes less than earthbound. In fact, those dreams are a touch demonic: “And I dream till the very break of dawn  Of an impish dance on a red-hot griddle  To the screech and scrape of a corn-stalk fiddle.” We may imagine this refers to the punishment for pleasure sometimes believed to await us in the afterlife – though Dunbar wasn’t a conventionally religious poet. More likely, it’s a glance towards the hell on Earth endured most of the time by the plantation workers.• Smart Devices: 52 Poems from the  Poem of the Week, edited by Carol Rumens, is published by Carcanet.

What makes Stormzy’s imprint so different?In a glass-walled meeting room on the fifth floor of Penguin Random House headquarters in Pimlico, Theophina Gabriel is talking about her love of reading while laughing at her trigger-happy printing: “The last thing that came in I found so magical, it was 329 pages and I printed it all… Don’t worry I checked if I was allowed to first!” She’s part of a team that makes up one of the year’s most exciting literary imprints, #Merky Books. Today, the team is gathered around, drinking coffee and chatting about their pop-up event in east London the week before, which invited a community of young writers to dance and seek writing advice from the likes of playwright Inua Ellams and musician Wretch 32.The team are all characters worth reading about themselves. Twenty-two-year-old editorial assistant Gabriel, who routinely dresses all in purple (today she has a crop of lilac hair, violet glasses and a purple jumper), currently on an internship programme, was the first in her British Grenadan family to go to university, and publishes a radical zine, Onyx, which celebrates black creatives. Emma Wallace, 30, the senior audience and brand manager, is British Sri Lankan and English, and previously worked at start-ups and the BBC doing social media. The softly spoken founder and editorial director Tom Avery, 36, brings 13 years of publishing experience. And there’s 31-year-old commissioning editor Lemara Lindsay-Prince, who made her name as a writer, curator and founder of the acclaimed fanzine Plantain Papers, a homage to the delectable carb, which told stories across the diaspora.#Merky Books was the unlikely result of a meeting at which Avery invited Stormzy to write a book for Penguin in the summer of 2015. “One of the reasons I first approached Stormzy is that I loved the music and recognised something in that DIY attitude,” says Avery. “Stormzy’s incentive for creating the imprint was that he just felt like, ‘I know all these incredible writers that are just not getting very far.”’The slang term “merky” (loosely meaning something great) has also been adopted by Stormzy for his record label. If the heritage of the Penguin brand gave #Merky legitimacy in the publishing world, the Stormzy name broke down some of the barriers to access, reimagining the kind of stories that might “get far”. Launching in July 2018, it has gone on to publish three books: That Reminds Me, a fictional narrative told in verse by Derek Owusu about his troubled boyhood Taking Up Space by Chelsea Kwakye and Ore Ogunbiyi, which they describe as a “black girl’s manifesto for change” and Rise Up: The #Merky Story So Far charting Stormzy’s career, co-written by Jude Yawson.The recent signing of Malorie Blackman, the former Children’s Laureate, to publish her autobiography, is a major coup for the imprint. “I have been thinking about writing my memoirs for a while now, but the right moment never presented itself until a meeting with #Merky Books… an imprint that embraces new methods and ideas,” she tells me over email.The #Merky Books Instagram account has 17.5k followers and no shortage of submissions. Stormzy’s team has been proactive in putting forward promising young writers. The most recent signing is 20-year-old Jeremiah Emmanuel. I meet him in Creams, on Brixton high street, a dessert café filled with the heady scent of Oreo waffles. “I used to come here all the time after school,” grins Emmanuel between icy slurps of his blueberry and strawberry slushie. He explains how Creams and McDonald’s ended up being places to gather after funding cuts hit youth clubs in the area.Emmanuel’s memoir, Dreaming in a Nightmare, touches on wealth disparity, class and British Nigerian identity through youthful observations. “Once when I was about eight, I stayed on the 345 bus from Brixton to South Kensington,” he says. “By the time you got to Chelsea, you knew the floor looked the same colour as the day it was paved. There was no litter on the ground. There’s a chapter called ‘345’ about that.”The identity of #Merky Books is still in its formative stages. The team agree that the only prerequisite is that writers are “from under-represented communities”, which includes writers of colour, black writers, queer writers and beyond. It’s telling, then, how the wider publishing industry perceives it.A quick call around a few publishing houses to get their impressions on the new imprint elicits a range of responses, from “a home for young black men” to “a music imprint”, which gets a laugh in the room when I share it. In reality, the sheer breadth of the #Merky roster quietly makes the point about the thrill of erse writing without labouring the point which should by now be obvious: that universal stories can come from anywhere. Next year, they’re itching to take on science fiction, historical narratives, crime thrillers and short stories.I ask Avery whether things such as Michael Gove’s changes to the GCSE curriculum in 2015, which saw To Kill a Mockingbird replaced by books which met a more stringent definition of “English” literature, turned young readers off. “It’s hard to think that it wouldn’t have had an impact,” he says. Lindsay-Prince adds: “My parents are Grenadan and Jamaican and would centre black children’s books in front of me when all I was getting was Biff and Chip. The folklore they put in front of me was the antithesis to the school curriculum.”Later in the week, I meet another #Merky Books writer Hafsa Zayyan in a café in Holborn just around the corner from the office where she works as a lawyer in dispute resolution. “My double life!” she laughs. She sits down and takes a deep breath – she’s been up since 1am finishing the first draft of the manuscript for her debut novel, which won the first #Merky Books new writers’ prize (alongside co-winner Monika Radojevic). We Are All Birds of Uganda was written in snatched moments, on weekends and after work, into the dead of the night. It will be published next July and focuses on South Asians in Africa – her father is Nigerian and her mother Pakistani. “It’s specifically about Uganda because there’s quite an interesting story there,” she explains. “The second half of the story is set in the modern day and it’s about Sameer, whose family are Ugandan South Asians from the Gujarat province who ended up in Leicester after the expulsion. He’s living in the UK just trying to understand how he fits in and why his history is important.” The writing is poetic, recalling the cadence of Qawwali devotional songs, which may have been influenced by her years of reading the Qur’an in Arabic.Birds of Uganda is perhaps a useful illustration of the direction in which the imprint could go next. For now, they are focusing on crucial points of business: curating an in-house playlist for the team to share in the office and focusing on projects they hope will define the stories of a new decade. Right now, what the books all have in common is that they are inherently political, exploring everything from taking up space to celebrating social housing, and gearing up for a new decade in flux. “There’s lots of reasons people want to get lost in other worlds,” says Lindsay-Prince, leaning back on her chair. “We’re giving new readers somewhere to escape to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92f78e7042029ccb00ef799d4aa632b75298cf68/0_24_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0bc660eb429103b33ae38e7065ed0a4","title":"boeing 737 max production faa","story":"Planemaker has been told by the FAA that aircraft cannot return to service before 2020Boeing is considering whether to cut or halt production of its grounded 737 Max after the Federal Aviation Administration said last week it would not approve the plane’s return to service before 2020.The US planemaker’s board is holding a regular two-day meeting in Chicago, which started on Sunday, and the company could make an announcement on production plans as soon as late Monday.The Seattle Times reported on Sunday that the board is considering a proposal from top management to temporarily shut down 737 production. A person briefed on the matter told Reuters a temporary shutdown is more likely than another cut, but it would potentially take a few weeks before production could be halted.Boeing said in a statement on Sunday that the company “will continue to assess production decisions based on the timing and conditions of return to service, which will be based on regulatory approvals and may vary by jurisdiction”.Boeing has said if it did not receive approval to begin deliveries before the end of the year it could be forced to further slow production or temporarily shut down the Max production line, a move that would have repercussions across its global supply chain.The best-selling Boeing plane has been grounded since March after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people.On Thursday, Boeing abandoned its goal of winning approval this month to unground the 737 Max after its chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, met FAA administrator Steve Dickson. Dickson said on Wednesday he would not clear the plane to fly before 2020 and disclosed the agency had an ongoing investigation into 737 production issues in Renton, Washington.Dickson said there were nearly a dozen milestones that must be completed before the Max returns to service. Approval is not likely until at least February and could be delayed until March, US officials told Reuters last week.Boeing had said last month it expected the FAA would allow it to resume 737 Max deliveries in December.American Airlines said on Thursday it was extending cancellations of 737 Max flights until 6 April.The FAA told congressional staff in an email last week Dickson was “concerned that Boeing continues to pursue a return-to-service schedule that is not realistic ... More concerning, the administrator wants to directly address the perception that some of Boeing’s public statements have been designed to force FAA into taking quicker action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1621ea7c29db1360b463416b5380304207eeef77/0_60_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d9337300ef09e9bc9daa3ab718bb55b","title":"sports direct profits house of fraser stores close","story":"Mike Ashley says more stores in department store chain will close in the next yearThe company shocked the City in July when it said it would not be able to estimate annual profits because of an unexpected €674m (£562m) Belgian tax bill and dire trading at House of Fraser, the department store chain it bought out of administration in 2018. Sports Direct is planning to formally change the chain’s name to Frasers at a shareholder meeting on Monday.David Daly, the chairman of the group, said he believed its strategy of “elevating”, or moving towards more upmarket products and improved stores, was working.He added: “We are hoping that the political waters will be calmer in the coming months which will allow us to move out of this period of market unpredictability. This will enable us to plan appropriately for the future which is critically important.”Ashley said he expected to open five to 10 revamped House of Frasers stores under the Frasers name in the year ahead. However, he said more outlets would close as a number continued to be unprofitable despite paying no rent. Seven outlets have closed since Sports Direct acquired the chain in August last year, leaving 52.Ashley called for urgent reform of the business rates regime, which he said “is clearly helping to kill much of what remains of the UK high street”. He said large stores were coming under particular pressure from the property-related tax.Sports Direct said it did not expect the potential Belgian bill to lead to “material liabilities” after the company brought in accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers to carry out its own review. The company said it had now handed over all the required information to the Belgian tax authorities, which have said they expect to conclude a review of the main part of the bill – amounting to €491m – in the new year.In a typically wide-ranging and long statement issued to the City on Monday morning, Ashley took aim at a string of targets including the former management of House of Fraser, Debenhams and Goals Soccer Centres, as well as Jeremy Corbyn and other MPs, regulators and advisory firms.Sports Direct lost out when both Debenhams and Goals Soccer Centres were put into administration earlier this year, wiping out shareholders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bfb25a3529c49a64adbd09c1c32ce70a98331db/451_0_1927_1156/master/1927.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9a44ac4fc3679439b9961baa80e8a86","title":"a cinema a pool a bar inside the post apocalyptic underground future","story":"A missile silo converted into a 15-storey luxury subterranean apartment complex could be a taste of what lies in store in cities around the world Tucked away among cornfields in the midwestern United States, a military-grade chainlink fence surrounds a verdant berm on an otherwise empty plot of land. It is guarded by a camouflaged lookout with an assault rifle. Underneath this unassuming hill is a 15-storey inverted luxury tower block called the Survival Condo – and it could be a portend of future private underground developments in cities the world over.Stretching 60 metres below the surface, the Kansas silo was one of 72 “hardened” missile structures built during the cold war to protect a ballistic missile with a nuclear payload one hundred times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Nagasaki.It was bought in 2008 by Larry Hall, an ex-government contractor, property developer and doomsday prepper who, like millions of others, is actively attempting to adapt for what he sees as probable future conditions of wide-scale calamity. Preppers anticipate war, pandemics, climate chaos, nuclear disaster, runaway technology, or just a simple collapse of the supply lines keeping cities functioning. The end result of all these scenarios is the same: bedlam.Hall was able to buy the long since decommissioned silo for a fraction of its construction cost. He then spent $20m (£15m) transforming it into a cushy bolthole replete with a library, swimming pool, climbing wall, video arcade, shooting range, bar, cinema, and seven floors of private living space. Half floor units sell for $1.5m, full-floor units for $3m and penthouses for $4.5m, cash only.Fifty-five ultra-high-net-worth residents have purchased private apartments inside the condo. Residents are understandably cagey about sharing their identities, but include real estate moguls, a financial entrepreneur and two doctors. One resident had the view from her loft in Manhattan filmed in all four seasons, so it could be piped into high-definition screens installed as ‘windows’ inside the bunker. Residents often do not have specific motivations for moving into the bunker, they are acting on a sense of general unease about the future.Hall says 75 iniduals can survive inside the sealed, self-sufficient converted silo for up to five years during social, political or environmental instability – even total collapse. When the crisis passes, silo residents expect to be able to emerge into the post-apocalyptic world to rebuild.The condos are in such high demand that Hall is currently building out a second silo.The idea more of us might move underground once seemed hysterical but, as people continue to flood into fragile cities and the world shudders under our weight, it appears some find it more and more alluring.A daily drip of terrible news: flooding in Venice riots in Bogotá, Paris and Hong Kong nuclear tensions in the Korean Peninsula and Middle East Sydney and Los Angeles burning mass shootings – all feed a sense that something terrible is over the horizon that might require just such a bunker.Although the involvement of private sector investors and developers is new, the construction of underground bunkers by governments is not. Many are hidden in plain sight underneath our biggest cities.In Kyiv’s Arsenalna metro station, the deepest in the world at 105 metres, a steel shutter in the walls can be lowered to seal the tunnels and platform at the bottom of the escalators, creating a public nuclear shelter. The station was opened in 1960, in the midst of nuclear tensions with the United States. Other cities in the Soviet Union had similar systems. Much of the Moscow  is specifically engineered to protect against nuclear attack, where blast doors can seal train tunnels, allowing for a total seal against blast pressure and fallout. In 2015, the Russian authorities revived public civil defence training, effectively reactivating bunkers that had lain dormant since the end of the cold war.Berlin, being on the fault line between the Soviet bloc and the west, is also riven by extensive bunker systems on both sides of the now-demolished Berlin Wall. Some of these bunkers are air raid-shelters from the second world war and were retrofitted during the cold war for nuclear fallout filtration. Many are now in the care of Berliner Unterwelten, a group of tunnel and bunker devotees who have become the de facto custodians of the city’s subterranean heritage. On a snowy afternoon at Pankstraße station, a tour guide from the group called Kate took us underground and through a sneaky door to reveal bunk beds, kitchens, an infirmary, and a nuclear, biological and chemical air filtration system that could keep 3,339 ordinary citizens alive for 14 days underground.On the way back to surface level, she expressed frustration that many tourists viewed the bunker as a historical novelty. “Make no mistake,” she says, “the nuclear threat is current, and the fact that we know about this bunker means its usefulness is now limited.”In many parts of the world, governments never stopped building bunkers. Israel recently built a multistorey underground operations centre in Jerusalem and moved all future meetings of its cabinet into the bunker. Meanwhile, the UK government activated a team in a nuclear-proof bunker under a Ministry of Defence building earlier this year in preparation for potential chaos resulting from a no-deal Brexit.As governments build new bunkers, the abandoned subterranean cities of the cold war have become a hot commodity in the private market. In 2016, the British government listed for sale the Central Government War Headquarters, also known as “Burlington”. This 35-acre underground city just outside Bath was once the fallback headquarters for the government in the event of a nuclear strike on London. The subterranean space could be “buttoned up” to seal off and shelter 4,000 people for at least three months. Almost 60 miles of roads connect an industrial kitchen, sleeping quarters, radio broadcasting facility, laundries, dedicated rail line, drinking water reservoir, library and operation rooms.One of the prospective buyers looking to snap up the bunker for £3m was Robert Vicino, a doomsday prepper and real estate developer based in California looking to build a survival city. The Ministry of Defence eventually pulled Burlington off the market without explanation – perhaps due to parts of the bunker being listed on the heritage register, which complicates redevelopment.With Burlington off the table, Vicino set his sights on the 30,000sq ft (2,787sq m) bunker at RAF Chilmark near Salisbury, a 20-room hardened facility split over two floors. Five months earlier, Wiltshire police raided the abandoned bunker following information received that it had been into an enormous underground marijuana farm. Those events may have motivated the Ministry of Defence to find a buyer for the site. Vicino estimates the site could accommodate 154 people.Vicino’s Vivos Group has already built two facilities in the US in the voids left behind by the state. In Indiana, he spruced up a cold war bunker that now accommodates 80 preppers. And in South Dakota, at a site called xPoint, he has sold space in 575 concrete bunkers, part of an abandoned second world war ordnance depot.A different sort of annexation has taken place in Beijing, where reports emerged in 2015 of a million people living underground in around 5,000km of defunct subterranean tunnels and command bunkers from the cold war. Inhabitants of these tunnels were known as the shuzu, or “rat tribe”. Annette Kim, an urban planner from the University of Southern California, told Al Jazeera that she saw Beijing’s underground bunker cities “not as a relic of the cold war but as a possible precursor for urban living in densely populated Asian cities”.The most concerted move underground is taking place in Singapore, where officials are burying infrastructure, shops, pedestrian walkways, highways, storage facilities, homes and offices as part of a “subterranean masterplan” for the city-state. As an added bonus, spoils from excavation can be used to terraform new land and stave off rising sea levels.The Nanyang Centre for Underground Space, a research institute within Nanyang Technological University, is directing Singapore’s deep underground development. The director of the centre, Zhiye Zhao, told me his team imagines the future moving in only one direction: down.But Zhao did sound a note of caution. The biggest problems his team is tackling are not technical but social, he explains. To put it another way, we still don’t have a clear idea what long-term living underground will do to us.In other words, people might survive but that does not mean they will thrive. It might only be a matter of time before disquiet starts rippling through any post-apocalyptic underground society.Hall, though, is convinced that the social aspects of underground life can also be anticipated and prepared for. The key to wellbeing is maintaining expectations of normalcy, he believes, and safety, comfort, sociability and distraction are crucial.In that way, the Survival Condo’s amenities are not mere luxuries, they are critical to the functioning of its underground community.“Whether you’re woodworking or just taking the dog for a walk, it’s crucial that people feel they are living a relatively normal life,” he says. “You want good quality food and water and for everyone to feel safe and to feel they’re working together towards a common purpose. This thing’s gotta function like a miniature cruise ship.”Bradley Garrett’s new book Bunker: Building for the End Times, will be published by Penguin Random House in August 2020Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31ae095f14d4ab179a3a360d913784b61c76b423/0_160_7143_4286/master/7143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dca1d136cd6d04584063de6517d0ba9d","title":"labour revival change community activists plymouth","story":"The party needs to reconnect with working-class self-help, and leave behind the Big StateTen days before the election, I was in the Dumbiedykes estate in Edinburgh, a high-rise scheme a few minutes’ walk from the Scottish parliament, where a shrinking working-class community is hanging on in the face of gentrification. The neighbourhood, which had a Labour MP until 2010, is the headquarters of an organisation called Edinburgh Helping Hands, whose motto is “Solidarity not charity”: its work runs from giving children in the city free bikes, through football and boxing training, to basic help with the most urgent aspects of poverty.Its co-founder, Jim Slaven, was readying himself for a food-bank collection at Hibernian FC that would bring in huge amounts of provisions, donated by a constant stream of fans bringing bulging carrier bags. But before he set off, he walked us round his estate, and put its experiences in the context of politics. “Do you know who we never see round here?” he asked. “The left.”When I worked on films for the ’s Anywhere But Westminster series with my colleague John Domokos during this election, a big part of our plan was to cover the kind of community initiatives that Helping Hands exemplifies. The aim was partly to ensure that the stories we told always contained a large element of hope. But as we went on, we were also struck by the gap between what was happening on the ground and the distant noise of national politics.A week before our trip to Scotland, we had been in Grimsby, in a seat the Labour party would soon lose to the Tories after 74 years of dominance. We spent an afternoon on the Nunsthorpe estate, at Centre4, a trailblazing project housed in a former secondary school that does everything from funding new businesses to working on loneliness and social isolation. As in many of the projects we visited, most of the volunteers and activists were women, many of whom were so adrift from politics and the rituals of the election as to think that they were almost irrelevant.One woman we spoke to ran a charitable florist, aimed at bringing people a bit of what she called affordable beauty. “I feel very disillusioned with the parliamentary process,” she said. “I think we need a new party of some kind. I just don’t think they pay any attention to the north.” People in her town, she told us, wanted to see “actual, tangible transformations” and be directly involved in changing where they lived as a matter of personal pride. The problem was that this was something that national politicians seemed barely to understand.Three days after Labour’s crushing defeat, these encounters feel even more loaded with meaning. Even at the time, they spoke volumes about Labour’s predicament: if even people so driven to help their communities were uninterested in what the party had to say, was it really surprising that it seemed to be losing voters in their droves? But our conversations also highlighted Labour’s lack of roots in many of its supposed heartlands, and its weak relationships with modern successors to the kind of working-class self-help on which the party was built. If Labour is to have any hope of revival, this is where it has to start.This is complex, nuanced stuff. Plenty of Labour members and activists are involved in such grassroots initiatives, and some of Corbyn’s allies set great store by the idea of “community organising”. But the latter have never really seemed to get beyond the idea that trying to get involved in people’s everyday lives is a good electoral strategy. And besides, Corbynism’s promise of change was always let down by the sense of distant people at the top with no feel for the pulse of the country they wanted to govern.Many of the reasons for last week’s defeat have already become cliches, though that does not dilute their truth: people’s dismay with Corbyn’s leadership, the effectiveness of the Tory slogan “get Brexit done”, the fact that Labour’s relationship with its old, working-class base has been fraying for decades. But other parts of the story are still in danger of being overlooked. On the national stage, when Corbyn’s Labour tried to speak to the party’s old heartlands, it rarely found a register beyond a condescending narrative about decay and hopelessness, and the idea that only politicians in London could help: part and parcel of Labour’s enduring centralism, and a belief in the unreconstructed state that was ingrained in the old-fashioned hard-left politics Corbyn brought with him.Late last year, for instance, the party unveiled a party political broadcast and online video titled Our Town. It was acclaimed at the time as a bold step into new political territory, and it was undeniably emotive and affecting – but its narration reduced complex and nuanced realities to melodramatic tropes about abject decline. “These streets were once full of spirit, and hope … years of austerity have ripped the heart out of this place … we lost the factories, we lost the jobs, we lost confidence in our community.” The film turned on the promise that “change is coming”, before cutting to images of the party leader, as if he was the only person who could help. The point Labour missed was that change is already happening, all over the country, and one of its roles should be to encourage and accelerate it. Instead, it offered a cold political giganticism, which might have sounded convincing in the age of the factory and the grand national plan, but was quickly found wanting.Labour needs to be open to people from beyond its usual circles, keen to learn, and ready to listen to voices it might find discomfiting. In that context, rules and structures are part of what needs to be looked at, but there are far more important questions of culture, and the party’s collective mindset. Many of the people who joined the party in response to Corbyn’s arrival at the top were not the credulous disciples a lot of people might imagine. But nonetheless, the party’s outward image strayed dangerously close to surreal devotion to one man, a tendency to treat any criticism as heresy, and a fondness for political arcana and faction-fighting that were always going to repel far more people than Corbynism attracted.Crucially, the Labour party in Plymouth takes its place in a web of social enterprises and co-operative organisations, many of which have been fostered by its endlessly innovative Labour council. Pollard has campaigned against defence cuts that would have a dire effect on the local economy, and on the dangers of local tower blocks with Grenfell-type cladding, all publicised via Facebook videos that his constituents often mention without prompting. When last Thursday’s exit poll came through, he feared he was about to lose his seat. But in seven of the eight council wards in his seat, he came top. Somewhere in all that is the beginning of hope, and lessons Labour has to learn as a matter of urgency."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a07c5a9e01d9e6de2b48c6400f000854459b2772/36_0_1208_725/master/1208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b55cd9b3124f4c8d6179345871c477cf","title":"clint eastwood richard jewell female journalists","story":"The film Richard Jewell depicts women reporters in a way that is not only wrong, but actively harmful Early in my career I trekked out to the Washington DC suburbs to interview refugee families for a story. By the time I was done it was 7pm and snowing. A coordinator from a local advocacy group offered to drive me back into the city since the trains had stopped running.As we drove he started to remark on my appearance and asked if I had a boyfriend. I dodged each question, moving back to the story. But at one point he reached across the car at a red light to touch my shoulder. It was just for a moment, but my heart raced. I started to figure out how I might unlock the passenger door, wondering if I should jump out. Instead, I waited until we crossed into the city to quickly get out of the car, insisting that I could walk home.Years later, that moment remains the first but also one of the more innocuous threats to my safety while reporting as a woman, and a woman of color. Whether in West Virginia, New York or New Delhi, thinking of how to protect myself throughout the reporting process has become a critical part of working on a story. And I’m not alone – most women who work in this industry analyze their text messages to make sure they’re not misconstrued, and carefully choose the clothes they wear to interviews, the type of transport they use and where they stay when reporting.Richard Jewell is Clint Eastwood’s new film adapting the true story of a security guard wrongly accused of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bombing. But the film’s dubious depiction of history has created a new victim: Kathy Scruggs, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter who broke the story that Jewell was under investigation. Actor Olivia Wilde portrays Scruggs as a seductive femme fatale prone to reckless reporting and poor writing skills.This scene never happened. Scruggs was indeed a controversial figure in the newsroom – in the nonfiction book that served as source material for the movie, Kent Alexander and Kevin Salwen describe Scruggs as a loud, dogged reporter who wore low-cut shirts – but there is no evidence she slept with any of her sources. In fact, she already knew Jewell’s name when she approached an FBI agent in a bar to confirm this piece of information.The unverified scene only serves to join the ranks of other on-screen female journalists seducing their sources. There’s Zoe Barnes in Netflix’s House of Cards, Camille Preaker in HBO’s Sharp Objects, and even Rory Gilmore, in Gilmore Girls, as Sophie Gilbert pointed out in the Atlantic. The fiction is spread further by people like Jesse Watters, a Fox News host, who, in a recent segment, claimed that female reporters sleep with sources “all the time”.Imagine the impact this narrative has on women attempting to carry out the basic requirements of their job. As a colleague of mine pointed out, the trope only exacerbates the fact that women reporters “have to worry about looking credible just in case someone else might sexualize us”. She finds herself deciding whether to wear makeup or choosing whether or not to meet a source at a certain time or place. That can mean losing a tip or a story to avoid any grey area.Another editor at the  told me she had built a good rapport with a source while planning a story. But when she met him in person he started slipping in comments about her appearance into the conversation. He also ostensibly forgot to tell her that to observe his job operating machinery it would require her to share a tight physical space with him. She ended up watching from afar.There are the daily negotiations of being a female journalist and then there are the more extreme threats: the horrific sexual assault that reporter Lara Logan endured while covering protests in Egypt the sexual assault and murder of Kim Wall by a source or the number of Chinese journalists who say they have been forced into sex. And this is not, as films suggest, happening in secrecy. Even being filmed and on-air with a camera crew does not protect journalists trying to do their jobs: several World Cup reporters have been harassed on screen, and a reporter in Georgia was groped last week while covering a race.Years after my first stressful encounter in DC I was interviewing someone in the tech industry for a story. I had spent years protecting myself on the job – once breaking my toe while physically running away from someone trying to harass me. In this case, I thought I was perfectly safe. Then he reached down and kissed me on the cheek. Maybe it was a friendly kiss, I thought maybe he thought it completely innocuous.Whatever it was, it was a reminder that no matter how professional I was, I would still spend much of my energy being reminded that I was a woman in journalism. And the creators of movies like Richard Jewell would never understand why their sloppy storyline made that even harder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a038586b462c03fa1fbd29c9078699220fbd3839/0_120_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f57fd353e36d8854634b072c488bbe5","title":"dup titanic northern irish arlene foster","story":"Arlene Foster’s deal with the devil has backfired, with gay marriage and abortion liberalisation and a majority of nationalist MPs“So.” Thus, controversially, began Seamus Heaney’s retelling of Beowulf, the epic poem he translated into modern English, via the fireside cadences of his, and my, native Derry. And so has this election’s epic struggle for the heart of man ended with something greatly surprising, but oddly familiar: a sort of unexpected retread of the EU referendum that feels like it was presented for the benefit of slow learners. On Brexit, Tories are being praised for reaching the leave voters that Labour could not compel with compromise, with little to no comment on the fact that the Tories reached those same voters with a butcher’s bill of false promises and nativist scaremongering that should freeze the blood. It’s in Northern Ireland, however, that something tantalisingly more like common sense may yet have prevailed.In a rare reversal of all logic and protocol Northern Ireland, the traditional basket case of British politics, decided to hold its elections in a precinct of reality infinitely more grounded than its cousins across the water, and it’s clear who bore the toughest brunt. For those of us who dream of a kinder, more equitable society, the promise of the DUP’s misfortune has for some years now been a lone, spindly hand working the pump that keeps our hearts going. And on Thursday night those hopes were realised, as the party was given a solid shock to its system, and a jolt of agency returned to the SDLP and the Alliance party like the rush of blood that comes to the legs after one of those toilet trips that takes a couple of sudokus.What is there to say about Arlene Foster’s leadership that hasn’t already been said about that old lady who painted over that Spanish fresco? The DUP lost their influence over the Tories by trading a willing, if feckless, partner in Theresa May for a reptile like Johnson, a man who’s never met a partner he wouldn’t betray for a partner down the street with a few less mouths to feed. In fact, such language does the DUP altogether too much service. They were, after all, not betrayed. They were bought, and discarded. Arlene Foster was offered a billion pounds to enable a Brexit disaster and she took the money willingly. And she has now presided over a hypershambles of calamities for her own worldview that’s hard to calculate, whether socially, politically or electorally.The DUP lost its Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, the scowling, keychain-figure-of-a-basset-hound who was one of their key political strategists. There is no record of Dodds smiling since he is a man who, even at the happiest of times, sports the dismal mien of a period drama underling, so lord knows how he feels about losing his seat to Sinn Féin’s John Finucane.This is quite probably the most seismic shift of 2019. Belfast North is a seat Dodds has held for 20 years, a heartland of unionism that has never been held by a nationalist in its 135-year history. It’s now held by a Republican whose father was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries with the help of state forces, an event that even David Cameron was forced to admit involved “shocking levels of collusion”.Which brings us to the national question. In July, I wrote that a progressive, united Ireland was more likely than ever due to Foster’s incompetence, and now the north has shifted towards marriage equality and reproductive rights, and has a majority of nationalist MPs – all for the first time in its history. This election also delivered a resounding majority of remain parties, thanks to an election fought away from the fantasyland of false conviction offered across the water and rooted in the real world of direct threats to the Northern Irish way of life, and life in general. People for whom the border is harder to lie about because they themselves lie upon it. With a mandate for a Scottish independence vote now delivered for the SNP, the north now faces a credible prospect of its own unity poll, and perhaps even the first sense that conditions could coalesce to make that long-sung song a political reality.Local reporters spent most of Friday giving their reports of this bewildering news, during the blink-and-you’ll-miss-them segments the UK typically allot to Northern Ireland’s results. These were uniformly in front of the Titanic Museum, that giant, impressive monument to what was, until election night, the world’s most salutary lesson in Northern Irish hubris. When the Museum Of DUP Utter Self-Annihilation is eventually erected in its place, perhaps they’ll be charging euros on the door.• Séamas O’Reilly is a writer from Derry.

The phrase was rapidly deployed to define her – and liberals more generally – as out-of-touch elitists who dismissed voters as “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic – you name it,” in Clinton’s own phrase.What was easy to miss was the second half of the quote, which posed a more difficult question for liberals: what about the “other basket” of Trump voters – “people who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures and they’re just desperate for change. It doesn’t really even matter where it comes from.”Yet the frame was frozen before the second part of Clinton’s statement. The word “deplorable” hung over her campaign like a toxic cloud. She suggested, in her book What Happened, that it contributed to her defeat.A similar difficulty has haunted liberal discussions of voters who chose leave in the 2016 EU referendum. It became impossible to talk honestly about the complicated motivations for that vote. If its words were too strong – if anyone suggested that racism or xenophobia played a part – this was seized on as classic smug, elite contempt. “A slur on 17.4 million people”, Mark Francois called it, when Will Self said one didn’t “have to be a racist or an antisemite to vote for Brexit. It’s just that every racist and antisemite in the country did.”Remainers and Labour supporters were constantly accused of losing the argument because they were condescending to voters. Any suggestion that a vote for Brexit or Boris Johnson might express darker motivations than simply admiring the Tory manifesto is always met with a gloating snarl: no wonder you lost.So the real business of understanding what kind of resentments may motivate some of these votes – and, more seriously, how politicians and the tabloid press play on those fears – gets lost in a different scuffle about the right way to address these voters. And here we are, three years on: a Conservative party and prime minister with a history of racism and Islamophobia have just achieved the biggest majority since 1987, and we still don’t know how to talk to, or about, those who voted for such a party and such a man.This is the Clinton trap – the trap of “some, not all”. Any question about some of the preferences on display gets cynically collapsed into an attack on all voters – even when the “some” is explicit. Francois’ comic spluttering about a slur on 17.4 million people is a classic of the genre. There are many reasons one might vote for a party that has been endorsed by Tommy Robinson and Katie Hopkins. But it is not wild to assume that for some, xenophobia might be one of those reasons.Above all, it is a losing game to pretend that these qualities do not exist and aren’t being weaponised by the right, while trying to quietly and discreetly appeal to them. That way lies the dismal hedge of the Ed Miliband years, putting “Controls on immigration” on a mug and hoping it will slake voters’ appetite for some comforting nativism. There is a balance that can be struck between calling voters names and crudely pandering to them.One defining feature of a populist political climate is a feigned preciousness about the motivations of voters. They are always pristine and unimpeachable, especially when the voters in question are “left behind” or authentically working class – a class that never seems to include black or brown people. En masse, these voters are seen to express a “will of the people”, which must not be questioned or challenged, only passively accepted.That will – which takes shape in the years between elections, not on polling day – is in fact a composite of many factors. It is made up of ideological loyalty as well as a more abstract instinct that some politician is a wrong ’un. It is made up of information delivered by those parties who have greater access to media and more funds to do so. And yes, it is made up of human frailty, resentment and a yearning for status. The vision of Johnson’s Tory party is not really about Brexit – it is about renewing the status of “real” British voters via Brexit and its attendant cultural, social and economic meanness.This strategy is so central for the right – and so powerful – that it must be addressed head-on, without falling into the Clinton trap. It is clearly not a solution to write off voters who respond to this sort of messaging, or call them names. But addressing them isn’t just about tone or language, it is about a vision to offer people who think nobody cares about them, a vision that we should have started building the moment that the first “Controls on immigration” mug cracked in the dishwasher.It is an endeavour that needs to break the feedback loop between the rightwing media and the voter, get on the pitch and challenge nativist rhetoric, and move beyond feebly articulating anti- or pro-immigration positions. The reason people saw homelessness rise, the NHS on its knees and the deaths of thousands under austerity yet still voted Conservative is because they could not imagine an alternative. What is needed is that vivid alternative to the parochial nativism of a post-Brexit Britain, one that addresses those voters directly by making a pitch for their souls that goes beyond the economic. There were a few glimmers of that alternative during the last days of Labour’s muddled campaign, but by then it was much too late.• Nesrine Malik is a  columnist and the author of We Need New Stories: Challenging the Toxic Myths Behind Our Age of Discontent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24c3ad7634dee26574486df8a87d1070e3fc351b/186_291_4182_2509/master/4182.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84ec20b6110e2bc9ee503fcca377b8a5","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of present","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘present’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘present’.Share your photos of what present means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 18 December at 10am.

The Queen’s Speech is very much the Bond film of the Christmas TV schedules.It’s traditional for old people to talk to the TV, especially if they’re trying to remember which sitcom the actor in the funeral plan advert used to be in, or losing their shit with the news. But this is more than that, because the Queen’s Speech has been going on for decades and decades, ever since Her Majesty was barely out of her Princessing uniform.It’s probably the longest-running TV series of all time. Longer even than Coronation Street or The Weather. That’s why it can be hard to work out where you are in the plot when you first watch it. It’s probably one of those things that takes years to appreciate properly, like athletics and tomatoes.If you haven’t seen it before, it’s a bit like Gogglebox, but even posher than the bits with Stef and Dom in. The Queen, who you’ll recognise from her starring role in money, talks about what’s been going on in the world and how we have to put up with it all. It’s a sort of human Keep Calm and Carry On poster that looks like it’s done up for a wedding.So, for instance, this year, she’ll probably talk about the Greggs vegan sausage roll and how Ant’s back on I’m a Celebrity, and probably try not to mention the one-hour TV special her son did about a dead paedophile he liked. I mean, it’s a shame it got such a bad reaction, because it must have looked a good idea at the time.

And I’m finally on my way home.”Greta travelled by train from the COP25 UN climate conference in Madrid via a climate protest in Turin, Italy, on Friday. She is due home in Stockholm to celebrate Christmas with her family after a year travelling the world by rail, sea and road to highlight the threat of global heating.Deutsche Bahn (DB) was quick to respond to Greta’s tweet, apologising to the 16-year-old schoolgirl for the inconvenience and saying it was working on improving its trains.But on Sunday DB went on the defensive, deleting its initial tweet, and chiding Greta for failing to acknowledge the lengths its onboard staff apparently went to lead her to a seat in first class.“Dear Greta,” its press department wrote in a two-part tweet. “Thank you for supporting us railroaders in the fight against climate change! We were happy that you travelled with us on Saturday in the ICE 74 ... but it would have been even nicer, had you also reported how friendly and competently you were looked after by our team at your seat in the first class.”DB confirmed that Greta had travelled first class between the cities of Kassel and Hamburg. Greta responded swiftly, suggesting that DB had overreacted to her tweet by inferring that she had criticised the company for running an overcrowded service.Contrary to their claim that she had spent the entire journey in a seat in first class, Greta said in a tweet on Sunday afternoon she had only been able to sit in a seat after Göttingen, more than four hours into her journey, and for the remaining two hours, before having to change in Hamburg for a further connection towards Scandinavia.“This is no problem of course and I never said it was,” she wrote. “Overcrowded trains is a great sign because it means the demand for train travel is high!”Fellow passengers said she had been accompanied by her father, and that DB staff had given her little slabs of chocolate with the word “lieblingsgast” (favourite guest), which are normally given to passengers in first class as well as second-class passengers in the event of long delays."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a4afe13746b9cf9fbc5736640f24dfa532f18e1/0_71_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd955515800970c27dbc8abee0718903","title":"harvey weinstein my work promoting women has been forgotten","story":"Disgraced mogul tells New York Post he feels his pioneering work in gender equality has been ‘eviscerated’Harvey Weinstein has complained he feels like “the forgotten man” and that his “pioneering” work championing movies directed by and about women has been “eviscerated” in the wake of multiple sexual assault allegations against him.The 67-year-old producer, once one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, has faced accusations of sexual assault and harassment from dozens of women.Ahead of the start of his rape trial, Weinstein gave an interview to the New York Post. He spoke while recuperating in hospital after spinal surgery and said he was doing the interview to prove he was not exaggerating the claims about his ill health. The former movie mogul appeared in court last week using a walking frame.The New York Post reported that Weinstein showed little sign of remorse for the actions he is accused of.“I feel like the forgotten man,” he told the paper.“I made more movies directed by women and about women than any film-maker, and I’m talking about 30 years ago. I’m not talking about now when it’s vogue. I did it first. I pioneered it.“It all got eviscerated because of what happened,’’ Weinstein said. “My work has been forgotten.’’Weinstein said he got Gwyneth Paltrow a pay deal of $10m in 2003 for the movie View from the Top, which made her the highest-paid female actor in an independent film. Paltrow has accused him of harassment.He also said his production company championed social causes including buying the distribution rights for the documentary Paris is Burning, about ballroom culture in New York City, and Transamerica.“I want this city to recognise who I was instead of what I’ve become,” he told the Post.Douglas H Wigdor, the lawyer representing three of Weinstein’s alleged victims, said it was not possible to feel sorry for Weinstein “while he sits perched in an executive private hospital suite and asks New Yorkers to recognise his prior accomplishments which justifiability have been overshadowed by his horrific actions”.“Mr Weinstein’s latest public relations stunt on the eve of his criminal trial provides even more motivation to continue to prosecute the claims that will expose him for who he is.” Weinstein is due to go on trial on 6 January on rape and sexual assault charges in a state court. He has pleaded not guilty to these charges, which relate to incidents alleged by two female accusers in 2006 and 2013.If convicted, he could face a life sentence.Weinstein has also denied allegations by roughly 70 women of sexual misconduct dating back decades, saying any contact was consensual.More than 30 women who were allegedly subjected to sexual misconduct by Weinstein have reportedly reached a $25m settlement with him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ada344cdd4084052f251845c76968060b14def7/0_121_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fcd4e4c144adf79af0136fe2c44a3b8","title":"anna karina french new wave icon godard a life in pictures","story":"The Danish born actor, who was to become one of the icons of French new wave cinema in the 1960s, has died at the age of 79.

It is at this time of year, though, when I start expecting it as often as possible. After all, who knows when Christmas will take a dark turn? Last Sunday afternoon, for example, as the light was snatched away and the house shrank, and I needed to make this recipe again and take pictures, we went from a claustrophobic family slump to a small party of three in the space of an hour.The Chinese tradition maintains that for food to be perfect, all of the senses must be stimulated. Now, while I am cautious about using the word perfect, today’s recipe with bubbles is proof of this theory, with all five senses at work in the best possible way: the smell and sizzle sound coming from the oven (not to mention the pop of the cork and fizz in the glass) the sight of the golden carapace with sausagemeat inside touch as you grab a roll with your fingers and burn your tongue and the taste of oil-slicked focaccia and sausage and sage stuffing. Sausage rolls, but not as I knew them, until now.These are rolls of the bun variety, made from an olive oil-rich focaccia dough wrapped around a sausage, onion and sage filling. They are not intended as a rival to the classic, puff pastry sausage roll, but an ally. The dough recipe is my standard focaccia dough, and the nearest I come to making bread. The beauty of this recipe, taught to me by the Italian cook and teacher Carla Tomasi, is in the kneading, or rather the pulling and folding. You do this on an oiled surface with oiled hands, lifting the sides of the dough up and over as if you were gathering a drawstring purse.There are two Roman words I like a lot. The first is sfizio, which literally translates as “whim”, or meaning something you don’t really need. But it has come to mean a delicious thing, usually fried in oil, that you absolutely must eat. The second is sgargarozzare, which my wine-selling friend Antonio defines as: “To consume or throw back with joy, and with no intention of stopping.” These words feel entirely appropriate here, for stand-up dinners of hot cheese straws and anchovy puffs, lumps of cheese and fat-studded slices of salami, battered and fried things, your largest bowl filled with crisps and, of course, sausage rolls. Plus, lots of bubbles all consumed on a whim, and with no intention of stopping.200g ‘00’ all-purpose flour200g strong bread flour8g dried yeast or 20g fresh10g saltOlive oil250g sausage meat1 large red onion, peeled and thinly sliced1 handful sage leavesBlack pepperWhite wine or marsalaIn a bowl, mix the flours, yeast, salt, two tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil and 300ml tepid water into a soft, slightly sticky and shaggy ball of dough. Cover and leave to rest in a warm spot for 15 minutes.Turn the dough on to an oiled worktop, then lift and fold the sides of the dough up and over (the oiled surface helps this), before returning to a clean, oiled bowl. Cover and leave in a warm, draught-free place for an hour and a half. By the end of resting, the dough should be triple the size.While the dough is resting, make the filling. Fry the onion in a little olive oil with the sausage meat, squeezed from the casing and crumbled into the pan, some ripped sage leaves and lots of black pepper. Add a little white wine or marsala and leave to bubble for 10 minutes, until the sausage is cooked and the wine has evaporated.Working with oily hands, pull off walnut-sized lumps of dough, flatten slightly and put a teaspoon of filling in the middle, then wrap the dough around it, sealing carefully.Put the rolls on an oven tray lined with baking paper, then brush with more oil. Bake at 190C (170C fan)gas 5 for 15 minutes, or until puffed up, firm and golden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/626fa4e4125e379d8a44f5d06519b43fde2d185a/0_103_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=244adfa8596bc77aaf35ff4b216f4f93","title":"arsenal mesut ozil uighurs china","story":"The midfielder is in tune with a United Nations panel and human rights groups over the imprisonment of millions of Uighurs but the club chose to raise a white flagArsenal might not be any good at parking the bus. But they sure know how to throw Mesut Özil under one. Imagine the frantic boardroom conversations on Friday after Özil expressed his horror at the imprisonment of millions of Uighurs in China. The fear of losing profits from shirt sales, commercial deals and future pre-season tours must have choked senior executives like Beijing residents in smog season.In the club’s rush to post on the Chinese social media site Weibo that Özil’s comments were merely his “personal opinion” – before a simpering reminder that “Arsenal has always adhered to the principle of not involving itself in politics” – all that was missing was a white flag. Appeasement is never a good look, even if it is cloaked by apparent indifference.Just his personal opinion? Hardly. Özil was entirely in tune with a United Nations panel and multiple human rights groups who have spoken out about the imprisonment of millions of Uighur people in internment camps without trial for “re-education” in what has been described as the largest incarceration of one ethnic group since the Holocaust, with multiple accounts of torture, rape and abuse from eyewitnesses who have passed through.Arsenal’s reaction might have been proportionate if Özil was posting about the need for more NHS spending, or voicing his views on whether Brexit is a good idea. But when human rights groups are warning of systematic “brainwashing” – and when one Uighur man who badgered colleagues at work to pray more and not watch porn is tried for inciting ethnic hatred and jailed for 10 years – it just sounds callous.Only last week Anthony Joshua was widely criticised for not speaking out about human rights in Saudi Arabia. Yet can you blame sportspeople for staying quiet when they see Özil bravely raising his head above the parapet only to be shot down by his own club? As for Arsenal not involving themselves in politics, what did the club think they were doing when they agreed a £30m deal with the Rwandan government to promote tourism? Yes, the same Rwandan government that Human Rights Watch warns is guilty of “arbitrary detention, ill-treatment and torture” – and is one of 38 countries worldwide where human rights defenders face reprisals for cooperating with the UN.Of course in trying to be apolitical, Arsenal were desperately trying to put a lid on the problem before the top blew off it. They would have seen the fate of the Houston Rockets, who plunged from being one of China’s most popular NBA teams to being blacklisted after its general manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for protesters in Hong Kong, flashing before their eyes.The Rockets are already a textbook study of what happens when you upset the Chinese government, who according to the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, also made the extraordinary demand that Morey be sacked. The NBA has also suffered blowback, with CCTV-5, the country’s state-controlled broadcaster, replacing coverage of US games with highlights of the Chinese league.The decision by CCTV not to show Arsenal’s match against Manchester City is another reminder that there is no middle ground here. No way to stick up for human rights and free speech without angering China. You are either for such values or against them.As Simon Chadwick, a professor of sports enterprise at Salford University who specialises in China, puts it: “The world is in the midst of an ideological battle: western liberalism versus eastern authoritarianism. And sport is one of the front lines.“This case reveals a great deal about China’s growing power, how it seeks to exercise it, and what it deems to be acceptable and unacceptable. It also reveals how far the balance of power has tipped away from Europe and towards China.”So what should Arsenal have done? Of course, the club were placed in an invidious position. But surely it was not beyond them to find a similar form of words to those used by Silver in the midst of the Morey firestorm. He pointedly told the Chinese government that American values travelled with the league wherever it went. “And one of those values is free expression,” he said.Failing that, the club should have said nothing – just as they did when another Arsenal player, Héctor Bellerín, voiced his support for Labour on the morning of the general election.Meanwhile, this issue is clearly not going away. Last week it was Joshua who faced accusations that he was being duped by a Saudi regime paying him around £60m to “sportswash” the kingdom. This week it is Arsenal in the firing line. In the days ahead, Liverpool are bound to face questions in Doha when they play in the Fifa Club World Cup. Clearly clubs and organisations need to think harder about finding an elegant way to walk the tightrope if they decide to take the money of certain regimes.But as the backlash over Özil’s Instagram message intensifies, some at the Emirates Stadium might just wonder about replicating that famous Mitchell and Webb sketch in which two Nazis ask themselves: “Are we the baddies?” On this issue there is only one answer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5360b8da1a152bef04f23939246f6a9d25e28f8/0_307_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aef3fb30d83c17ee0210f4caefdb57c","title":"luke norris colchester fishing manchester united cup","story":"Colchester forward is preparing for Manchester United and the biggest night of his career by waiting for a 42lb carpIt is an overcast day in late November, and Colchester United have given their players a day off. A few minutes’ drive from their training ground, by the side of a small private lake accessible only, given recent rain, by navigating across a few hundred metres of thick sludge, Luke Norris is putting up a tent. This will be the striker’s home until the next morning, when he will pack up and head straight to training. Inside the tent is a simple camp bed and some basic provisions, protected from the rats that frequent the water’s edge inside the lake is a 42lb carp, and Norris hopes to catch it sometime in the following 22 hours .Whenever it happens, the enormous fish will be out of the water only for as long as it takes to secure a commemorative photograph. The only giant-killing Norris is interested in is of the footballing kind, with his team already having knocked Crystal Palace and Tottenham out of the Carabao Cup and heading to Old Trafford on Wednesday in the quarter-finals. “There’s one fish I’m after and I think if I get that fish I’ll move on, I’ll go to the next lake,” he says. “I think that’s normally what guys do – they’ll see a fish, either in the magazines or on social media, and they’ll think: ‘I want that one.’ It’s the biggest one in the lake, and most of the time guys do want the biggest fish in the lake. I’ve had bigger over in France but in the UK that is a good fish.”It certainly makes a difference from the kind of targets most strikers set themselves. Norris, who scored the first as Colchester came back from 2-0 down to draw at Scunthorpe on Saturday, does also have a figure in mind for the number of goals he would like to score this season – “I’ve always kept it to myself, but I do have a number where I think: ‘If I can get to that, I can accept that for the season’” – but once the final whistle goes, his attention switches. “I aim to get out for an overnighter a week and if I have a bit more time maybe a bit more,” he says.So it was that while most Colchester fans and players were basking in their side’s victory over Palace in August, Norris had other ambitions. “We had a really good night and then that Wednesday morning I came down fishing, and I caught the biggest fish I’d ever caught in England,” he says. “That was great. It was almost like: ‘This is the perfect week.’ I’ve had other weeks when I’ve had a bad game and you think: ‘I can get away.’ You come down here, you don’t catch anything and it’s almost like you get hit twice. Football’s so manic, there’s so much pressure 247, even at our level. So this is your little getaway, this is your time to get away, away from the mad world.”It all started with a 3-0 home defeat of\u0026nbspSwindon\u0026nbspin August for a first League Cup win since 2010. Three weeks later they held\u0026nbspCrystal Palace\u0026nbspto a goalless draw at Selhurst Park, winning 5-4 on penalties as Dean Gerken denied Andros Townsend from the spot. In the third round, it was the turn of Mauricio Pochettino’s\u0026nbspSpurs: another goalless draw and a dramatic 4-3 win in the shootout, despite Jevani Brown’s failed Panenka, prompting a wild pitch invasion. They finally conceded a goal in a rare all‑League Two affair in the last 16 against\u0026nbspCrawley\u0026nbspbut roared back to secure a 3-1 win and a date with Manchester United.As the water cools towards the start of winter, the carp become less active and consequently harder to catch. Norris frequently spends entire days and nights here – watching the water, waiting, listening – without anything happening at all. “Winter fishing’s a hell of a lot harder than any other time of year,” he explains. “They’re normally at their biggest weight and they normally look their best – they get some lovely winter colours. A fish in the winter is always worth a few fish in the summer. People think it’s a bit crazy but people who are in carp fishing, they get it. They understand.”There is no mobile phone reception, no alternative sources of entertainment, so Norris will just sit and wait, hoping to hear the telltale sound of a fish leaping out of the water, or the buzz of the bite alarm should something take his bait. Normally his only company is his French bulldog – absent today through illness – plus the occasional fox, muntjac deer and “a hell of a lot of rats”.The lake is not exactly picturesque, particularly with diggers mauling the opposite bank, but it is infinitely more tranquil than Norris’s alternate reality, leading the line in the occasionally pell-mell frenzy of League Two football, and in an entirely different universe to a night at Old Trafford, whose average attendance this season is more than 20 times Colchester’s. Norris has been crucial in the cup run, scoring the equaliser in the 3-1 win at Crawley in the last round as well as taking and converting the first penalties in the shootout wins against both Palace and Tottenham. “I do think penalties are a bit of an art,” he says. “I think people do make them harder than they should be. It’s always been something I’m very confident with. I think if you pick your side and you hit it true, I think it’s very tough for them to save.”Norris is related by marriage to Manchester United’s club captain, Ashley Young – like him, a native of Stevenage – and has been to Old Trafford once before, with his United-supporting cousin on a stadium tour. “I think it’ll be a bit different with 70,000 people there instead of walking round an empty stadium,” he says. “We’ve got lads at the club who support Manchester United, so they’re going up against a team they would go and pay to watch. We’re in a no-lose situation, as a League Two side going to one of the biggest clubs in the world. They’re not at the level they’ve been at in the last few years, and we’ve got nothing to lose. We could end up getting hammered but the way we’re playing I don’t think that’ll happen. I think we’ll give it a right good go. Stranger things have happened in football. It would be stupid to say we don’t have a chance, because people said that with Palace and Spurs.”Whatever happens on Wednesday night, it is fairly easy to predict where Norris will be the next morning, pitching his tent and setting up his rods. “The lads at football don’t get it but I’d rather have something like this than not have anything at all,” he says. “Football life is so manic – you do short hours but it’s always so physically demanding. I think that’s why it works so well: you get to chill out and enjoy being outside. People nowadays get too worried about what everyone thinks. This whole social media, it’s: ‘How many likes I can get, how many this, how many that.’ Everyone’s always going at 100 miles an hour. Fishing’s totally the opposite, it’s nice and calm.”Old Trafford can wait a while. For now, Norris’s focus is on the water and the monster in its depths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f2dfe36f44b678c076b4c829bf5ab733edabb3c/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6eeec9176b1694817af4eb86d7a49887","title":"premier league talking points weekend action","story":"The scoreline suggests a clear and obvious case of déjà vu. But City’s victory at the Emirates Stadium was a little different from their other recent wins against Arsenal. Pep Guardiola started with an unusual 4-2-3-1 formation, with two holding midfielders and Kevin De Bruyne as a No 10, and his team seemed more content than usual to allow the opposition to have the ball. They knew they could slice and dice Arsenal with sudden attacking thrusts, especially with De Bruyne in such regal form. There was a savage ruthlessness to City’s play and Arsenal were 3-0 down after 40 minutes despite having more of the ball. With Arsenal’s spirit broken, the match finished with the familiar sight of City passing the ball around in the opposition half. For once City’s effortless possession did not tell the story of the game. Rob SmythNewcastle ended the match at Turf Moor with four strikers on the pitch but they had failed to muster a shot on target between them. It was the first time in Burnley’s Premier League history that they had stopped their opponents from achieving such a mediocre feat. The Clarets are a well-organised unit but not testing the goalkeeper in 90 minutes is shameful. Andy Carroll was an aerial threat around the box but never in it his most dangerous moment was when he caught the resilient Ben Mee with an elbow. Carroll has not scored a league goal since April 2018 and his lack of match sharpness means it will be a surprise when he does. Steve Bruce might need a better plan than swapping between him and Joelinton in the hope one finds form. Instead it could be time to give Dwight Gayle another chance to prove he is a top-flight striker. Will UnwinFrank Lampard is not a happy man at the moment. Chelsea have lost four of their last five league games and Lampard was fuming after Bournemouth’s latest victory at Stamford Bridge, questioning whether his players possess the personality to break down opponents who sit deep and disrupt their rhythm. It was another insipid performance in front of their fans from Chelsea, who have only four home wins this season, and it bolsters the argument that they need to spend now their transfer ban has been halved. None of their creative players is showing enough consistency and, with his team’s hold on fourth spot looking uncertain, Lampard cannot tolerate the lack of decisiveness in the final third much longer. Mason Mount is showing signs of fatigue and Willian, out of contract next summer, was poor against Bournemouth. No wonder Chelsea are interested in Fyodor Chalov, Moussa Dembélé, Jadon Sancho, Timo Werner and Wilfried Zaha. Jacob SteinbergIt has not happened often enough yet this season but Norwich’s brightest talents all came to the fore at once on Saturday, and more performances like the 1-1 draw at Leicester could yet haul them out of the mire. Max Aarons covered a prodigious amount of ground from right-back, Emi Buendía was a bewitching and effective presence on the ball in possibly his best showing of the campaign, while Teemu Pukki did exactly what Teemu Pukki does. But perhaps the most convincing operator of all was Ben Godfrey, who would reportedly set suitors back £50m if Norwich get their way and on this evidence may be worth that kind of investment. Godfrey is only 21 but sailed through on all fronts, his imposing physical frame getting the better of Leicester’s attack and some sublime distribution from the back putting Norwich on the front foot. One raking 60-yard pass almost put Pukki in for the winner late on. If the worst does happen in May then you suspect that, in whatever they receive for Godfrey, Norwich will essentially have an extra parachute payment. Nick Ames“I don’t celebrate goals any more,” Jürgen Klopp said with a shrug. As the Liverpool manager’s celebrations are often something to behold, that probably counts as another downside to VAR. Had Watford scored a goal or two at Anfield, and they certainly had the chances, a lot more would have been heard about the disallowed Sadio Mané goal at the start of the second half. The latest VAR ludicrousness could have had a bearing on the title race if Liverpool had dropped points, as it was a fine Xherdan Shaqiri cross and a perfect Mané finish counted for nothing due to the scorer eventually being adjudged offside by an eyebrow or something just as imperceptible. Once again the question must be posed: are these pettifogging and increasingly arbitrary interventions really the future the game wants to embrace? Paul WilsonIs it time for Mason Greenwood to get a proper run in the Manchester United side? His superb equaliser against Everton on Sunday means he now has more Premier League goals this season (two) than starts (one) and, though Ole Gunnar Solskjær has largely restricted him to cameos off the bench, the case for starting him – perhaps ahead of Daniel James, who after 26 games in all competitions looks in need of a rest – is becoming increasingly hard to ignore. Part of the issue is whether Greenwood, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford – all quick forwards who like to attack central areas – can truly complement each other in a front three. But it seemed to work a treat against Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League, and there surely comes a point when you just have to suck it and see. Jonathan Liew • Match report: Manchester United 1-1 EvertonAfter seeing Aston Villa disappoint during Saturday’s defeat at Sheffield United – their sixth loss in eight league games – Dean Smith has an interesting pickle to chew on. How many of his first-choice players should the Villa manager deploy in the Carabao Cup quarter-final against a Liverpool shadow side on Tuesday? Along with a semi-final spot, an authoritative win could prove a timely boost before a critical run of Premier League fixtures: they have to play all three of the teams below them in the table before the new year. But injuries – or defeat by a band of rookies – would be a painful blow at a tricky time. Paul DoyleOne step forward, two steps back: two wins on the bounce have been followed by back-to-back defeats and a pervading sense Southampton are treading water. After that 9-0 shellacking by Leicester and insipid home displays against Bournemouth and Everton, a desperately flat performance against West Ham on Saturday was the latest worrying episode for Ralph Hasenhüttl, who surely hoped his side had turned a corner. Worryingly, sluggish starts seem to be a recurring theme for Southampton, who have taken eight points from the past 33. “The speed of the ball wasn’t quick enough, in the second half this was better, not always perfect but we tried it,” Hasenhüttl said. “But in the end we lost a very important game.” Next up for Southampton? A trip to Aston Villa, another team stuck in the mud. Ben FisherKelechi Iheanacho was not having a bad game the striker was at the heart of everything positive going forward for Leicester but Brendan Rodgers knew his presence was creating an imbalance in the team due to the change in formation which helps accommodate the in-form Nigerian. Rodgers acted quickly and decisively, bringing on Demarai Gray in place of the former Manchester City striker, the same happened at the break when Dennis Praet was sacrificed for Harvey Barnes. Rodgers worked with José Mourinho early in his career and this level of ruthlessness has rubbed off on him, it would seem. He might come across as everyone’s mate but Rodgers looks like he means business as he eyes top spot. There is no place for sentiment at the top and Rodgers will not want to repeat any perceived mistakes from the last time he challenge for a Premier League title.

It’s a difficult one. Real Madrid are the best. We want to be the best so we have to try and beat them. It’s always a pleasure to play against Real Madrid. We know them very well. They know our manager. Accurate of exactly five minutes ago (following the draw), here are the live odds for teams to win the Champions League outright. Manchester City remain favourites to win their first-ever Champions League, despite drawing Real Madrid. That is a horrendous draw for the English sides, save for Tottenham. Of the sides that Liverpool (Atalanta, Atlético Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Lyon, Real Madrid) and Manchester City (Real Madrid, Napoli, Atlético Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Lyon) could have drawn, theirs are arguably the hardest.Should be an easy one for Gattuso and co. José Mourinho is going to win the whole thing, isn’t he. Cristiano will be pleased with that.Bayern were the only team to win all six matches in the group stage. Tough ties for the English sides! Liverpool go back to the Wanda politano, where they were crowned champions of Europe just a few months ago.A relatively soft tie. Atalanta are the first debutants to reach the last 16 since Leicester. An easy one for the favourites, Manchester City, then. That’s if they are still favourites. A whopper to get us started. Thomas Tuchel will return to Dortmund. Here we go! The draw starts now. Kelly Smith, England legend, is invited onto the stage to help with the draw. She talks of how great it is that the Women’s Champions League will be expanded to include a last-16 group stage for the 2021-22 season.Hamit Altıntop, formerly of Bayern, Schalke and Galatasaray, is another to join the ceremony. This year’s Champions League final, of course, is in Istanbul, Altintop’s home country. He also won the Puskas Award in 2010 for this thunderbastard. Woof. The last time we had a Champions League draw, back in the summer, Slavia Prague were drawn into the ‘Group of Death’ with Barcelona, Dortmund and Inter. Ah.Here we go: Pedro Pinto, formerly of CNN, will host the draw. Ledley King, Tottenham’s representative at the draw, looks nervous. This is a fun story: Chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen leads second-placed Nick Tanner, the former Liverpool and Bristol Rovers defender, and his team “winorloseonthebooze”. There are over seven million people playing that game. A friendly reminder that the Europa League last-32 draw will follow this one. The same rules apply there, but we could easily see Rangers play Arsenal or Manchester United or Celtic face Wolves. Based upon their past performances in this competition, it is perhaps surprising to see Manchester City as the clear favourites before the draw. Here are the current odds for all the teams. This is the first ever season in the Champions League where all 16 teams have come from the top five leagues in Europe. Shakhtar, Ajax, Benfica and Zenit all came close to qualifying, but ultimately it was only the teams from England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain that qualified. Atalanta are perhaps the team that most teams will be hoping to face. They gained just one point from their first four games, before two wins saw them qualify as runners up with seven points, behind Manchester City in Group C. Their dance here is, of course, a tribute to their captain, Papu Gómez. So it’s about 30 minutes until the actual draw, which takes place at Uefa’s HQ in Nyon, Switzerland. Here are some red-hot pictures of the stage to get your juices flowing. Hello world! It is 64 days until the next Champions League action, but don’t let that stop you getting excited! Glory awaits! Or at least a lucrative payout when your team falls at the first hurdle! Exciting!Here are the 16 teams that are left in the competition with eight group winners and eight group runners up making the cut. Some basic ground rules: group winners will be drawn against group runners up, but cannot be drawn against other teams from their own nation, or from the group that they qualified from. E.g. Liverpool (Group E winners) cannot be drawn against Napoli Chelsea or Tottenham Hotspur. Liverpool can therefore draw: Atalanta, Atlético Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Lyon, Real Madrid. Manchester City can therefore draw: Real Madrid, Napoli, Atlético Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Lyon.Spurs can therefore draw: PSG, Juventus, Barcelona, RB Leipzig, Valencia.Chelsea can therefore draw: PSG, Bayern, Juventus, Barcelona, RB Leipzig. Got it? To work out the non-English teams’ potential draw, you can view all of the Champions League groups right here.

Even though this is my second research trip to the cobalt provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, I am ill-prepared for the torment I will witness. We thank Bisette for her courage, for we know she is fearful that even a rumour that she is speaking to us could result in brutal reprisals against her and her family. She inhales sharply and recounts a tale of unimaginable grief.Raphael was born to Bisette’s sister, but after both his parents died when he was a baby, Bisette raised Raphael as her own son. She says he was a bright and cheerful child. Raphael loved to learn but, when he was 12 years old, the family could no longer afford the $6 (£4) a month required to send him to school. Instead, Bisette says Raphael did what most children in his village had to do: he went to work as a surface digger at a nearby industrial cobalt mine near Kolwezi.When Raphael turned 15, he was strong enough to dig tunnels at the site. Bisette says that on 16 April 2018, Raphael was deep underground with a group of 30 diggers when the tunnel above him collapsed. She heard the news and rushed to the site. “I prayed to God: ‘Please, let my son be alive,’” she says. When she arrived at the mine, she says, she was informed that no one had survived.I try to imagine the moment – when Raphael was crushed in the earth, screaming for his mother, suffocating in darkness, dying alone.Every lithium-ion rechargeable battery in smartphones, tablets, laptops, and electric vehicles requires cobalt to recharge. Approximately two-thirds of the global cobalt supply is mined in DRC. A considerable portion of this supply is mined by an informal workforce of artisanal miners, called “creuseurs”.Children and creuseurs are not formally allowed at large, industrial cobalt mines. But Bisette and scores of other families we interviewed said their children had been working at sites operated by foreign mining companies for years.I first went to DRC in the summer of 2018 to research the conditions under which creuseurs mine cobalt, intending to promote change through academic research, writing a report, and policy engagement. That plan changed irrevocably the day I met Elodie.I found the child, a girl caked in dirt with an ailing newborn strapped to her back, hacking at the ground for cobalt at Lake Malo, not far from Kolwezi. Her limbs were like sticks, her face was crusted with mucus and she had a rib-cracking cough. The horror of her wretched existence could never be remedied by an academic report, I decided. An attempt had to be made to hold someone accountable.I returned home and tracked down Terrence Collingsworth, a human rights lawyer and expert in strategic litigation. Together with my Congolese colleague, Roger-Claude Liwanga, a professor at Emory University, we coordinated with partners in DRC to approach families deep in the cobalt territory. We finally found 14 families who wanted to tell their stories. By September 2019, Terrence, Roger, and I were sitting down in DRC to meet Bisette.This lawsuit is intended to compel the defendants to remedy the horrific conditions at the bottom of cobalt supply chains. Whether our legal system agrees that they should be held to account for the death and injury of these children remains to be seen. Whatever the outcome, it will be the first time that the voices of the children suffering in the dark underbelly of one of the richest supply chains in the world will be heard in a court of law.The day before I met Bisette, I experienced quite viscerally just how deadly cobalt mining can be. I was documenting a cobalt site near the village of Kapata, when I learned that a tunnel dug by creuseurs had collapsed, not 100 meters from where I was standing. I rushed to the site, but the area was already under guard by the Congolese military when I arrived, so it was impossible to gain entry. Bereaved family members wailed with terror. Behind the dust and madness, it soon became clear – no one had survived. According to people at the mine, 63 people were buried alive that day.Perhaps the greatest tragedy of all is that global tech companies have yet to devote adequate attention and resources to ensure safety, dignity, and decency for those who mine their cobalt in DRC. I pray that every consumer will refuse to buy any new cobalt-containing device until they do so.Bisette finishes the dreadful tale of her Raphael’s demise, but her torment is far from over. She is heading next to Kapata. Her nephew was one of the 63 people buried alive in the tunnel collapse the previous day.A change comes over her features that haunts me to this day – the horror of a mother imagining her child buried alive. She cries out: “Our children are dying like dogs.”Some names have been changed. All the companies named have been approached for comment.• Siddharth Kara is an author, research, and leading expert on modern slavery and child labour.

She recalled nearly leaving drama school in her first year “because I felt so uncomfortable, so working class.“I remember being told by the teacher who I was studying received pronunciation with that my accent was lazy, that south Londoners had lazy mouths and lazy accents,” she said.Maxine Peake has also spoken about the class prejudice she has experienced in the industry, revealing the pressure she was under to sound more posh in the first series of the BBC One barrister drama Silk.Simon Mellor, ACE’s deputy chief executive, said there was “a growing body of evidence that people from lower socio-economic backgrounds are under-represented in publicly funded culture”.That was “a significant concern” he said. Gathering better data was an “an important step in understanding the scale of the problem and helping us to consider what steps we can all take to challenge the barriers that people face in entering and progressing in our industry.”From next year people who work for ACE’s national portfolio organisations, will be asked: “Thinking back to when you were aged about 14, which best describes the sort of work the mainhighest income earner in your household did in their main job?”Abid Hussain, ACE’s director of ersity, said research had been carried out to alight on the most appropriate question.“It has taken a bit of time to develop and get it right but we are quite excited that it’s going to be a question that people will have interest in responding to.”He hopes to start publishing socio-economic data in ACE’s annual ersity report in 2021."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f146bd608693938a109726306d9d815688467cef/0_355_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01d1d40c060a8f2f98cfca011ff38101","title":"i no longer love my boyfriend but cant afford to leave him mariella frostrup","story":"It’s worth examining the cause of your dissatisfaction before you shut the door for good, says Mariella FrostrupThe dilemma I’ve fallen out of love with my boyfriend. I wanted to leave two years ago but, as with many couples stuck in the rental cycle, I had neither the money to walk away from my deposit, nor somewhere else to go. The thought of sharing a cramped apartment with an extremely upset man also didn’t appeal. It was easier to keep the peace, plaster over the doubts and fight for our relationship.My boyfriend isn’t a bad man – one of the reasons I’ve stayed is because he and his family have been a huge support, especially in comparison with my family who are shakier than the branch of a tree and plagued with mental illness. I’m desperate for stability and to put down roots. This wouldn’t be achievable without another name on the mortgage.I don’t know what to do. I’m nearing 30 and have no inclination to marry him, which I know is an indicator to leave. He knows it’s bad, too. We argue at least three times a day, but he comes from a culture of “We’re together now, we’re together for always.” And it’s not a bad match. If I pick up the dice to roll a six, will I lose the four I’ve got?Mariella replies Four to six? You are right to say it’s a gamble. I was all set to come over and show him the door myself until you mentioned your dice roll. Maybe my expectations are uncommonly low – an inbox of other people’s problems will do that to you. Halfway to a full house seems a tolerable position to be in, while a full two-thirds is edging on honeymoon bliss in my book.Few marriages would rate as tolerably, which begs the question: what’s awry? Either you’ve given me a bad steer or you’re chasing down perfection, neither of which is helpful here. “I’ve fallen out of love with my boyfriend” isn’t particularly informative, but let’s start as you did, with your unhappy cohabitation.Living together in misery may be bearable – and don’t think I don’t appreciate the fiscal repercussions of flight – but it’s not sustainable. Despite the fact that one in two marriages now ends in orce, there remains a tendency to treat relationships without contract or children as in some way lesser. But what if we take the demise of your union as seriously as we would the untangling of a long-term liaison? My first step would be to identify the cause of your dissatisfaction, then seek help to find a resolution before you shut the door for good. I’m not sure whether, in adulthood, being “out of love” is reason enough for separation. After all, what does that mean when you’re a grown-up and not in the first flush of passion?That’s not to say you should stay together out of duty. As I’m sure you’re aware, there’s a big wide world out there full of alternative possibilities, some good, some bad and all different. Neither am I setting myself up as some stoic of the last century, girded for a life of struggle and disappointment come what may, and advising others to accept a similar fate. If your heart stops fluttering when you see the phone number on your screen, is that the end of love or the beginning of something potentially equally satisfying? The answer is subjective. I can’t judge the depth of your feelings for this man, or the level of his goodness, but there seem to be more glimmers of hope than reasons to flee.Maybe I’m being over magnanimous – the season of goodwill can have that effect – but I’d be tempted to take the sustainable course first. That means attempting to mend what you’ve got rather than just binning him and looking for a replacement. These days we’re all about limiting waste and investing long-term, intentions we would do equally well to apply to our relationships. The rush of adrenalin, the thrill of the chase and the searing heat of initial passion are like fossil fuels – they run out eventually. Based on what you say, and taking your unstable family into account, it’s possible you’ve already landed safely. Love has many dimensions and losing one aspect doesn’t leave you empty-handed.I appreciate the financial difficulties of setting forth alone and as someone who, until my 40s, was on that challenging path, I hope you’ll accept that I have form. Understanding that it’s a valid consideration is not the same as condoning the compromise if all you are focused on is climbing on to the first rung of the property ladder. I can assure you that losing a home you’ve bought together is as painful as staying coupled up simply to pay the bills.Only you can judge whether you’re settling for fear of the alternative, or failing to appreciate what you’ve got. Either way you need to summon up the courage of your convictions, and make a choice based on what your heart, having truly examined it, dictates.Finally, taking a more global viewpoint, compromising emotional wellbeing for a roof over your head was the fate forced on women for millennia. We do our predecessors a great disservice if today, with freedom of choice and equal opportunity for financial independence, we continue to behave as if we have neither.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

We were there to talk about a possible collaboration between the young people in his camp and schools all over the world: Limerick, Birmingham, Chicago, Newtown, Port Elizabeth, Tampico.“We left our music in the taxi,” Colm apologised.“Oh, you’re a fiddle player,” said Abdelfattah, off-handedly, pointing to a corner where a small pile of rubber bullets, gas cannisters and “sound bomb” shells also sat. “We were just given a fiddle by a lady in England, but it’s broken and nobody knows how to fix it.” And in the cramped office space, Abdelfattah began to talk of his concepts of beautiful resistance, using stories and music and dance and theatre to allow young people and women in the camp to become changemakers.Colm rose noiselessly from his chair and reached for the modern-looking case. The violin looked like something long ago sound-bombed. The strings were twisted. The bridge was hanging off.Upon the possibility of hope one always tastes the possibility of sorrow: the violin looked like my cliched concept of a refugee, silent, unstrung.Colm began to work with the strings. “Art puts us on an equal ground,” said Abdelfattah. Colm turned the bridge around. “We shape a better future despite everything we come up against,” said Abdelfattah. Colm loosened and tightened the pegs, adjusted the chin rest. “We do not want your sympathy,” said Abdelfattah. Colm made the strings taut: the violin began to look half-musical. “Seventy per cent of those who go through the Alrowwad programme don’t go to prison,” said Abdelfattah. Colm positioned the tail-piece. “People think these kids know only how to throw stones,” said Abdelfattah, “but we write, we sing, we dance, too.”The violin looked half sober. Colm worked his fingers around the peg box, plucked the strings, tightened and untightened the pegs, tuning from low to high. There were two bows in the case. One was brand new, unrosined. The second was older. Colm took a hold of the second one. The room waited. We had no idea if it would make any sound.This is the music of what happens: a plume of dust rose from the violin. It seemed to me a moment so theatrical it could only be true. Later, I learned that it was rosin dust rising from the bow hairs, but at the time it seemed that the thing was emerging from another age.Colm played Róisín Dubh, an Irish love tune from the 17th century. No singing, no words. The sound of the violin made a brand new lung of the room. He followed it with an improvised fusion piece involving the call to prayer, a dance tune we had learned in Nablus, and rap rhythms heard in Israel. It was some of the most glorious music I have ever heard.And then Abdelfattah – who had visited Belfast – asked if he knew the song Only Our Rivers Run Free. Again, no singing, but the words were there: “Where are you now when we need you?”The morning pressed up against us. We had to leave. But our stories never necessarily end. Colm found a tag in the case – from a shop in Bristol, England. He figured the violin was probably late 19th-century, maybe early 20th. An unopened envelope from the donor read: “To the New Owner of this Violin.”The letter remained unopened. The fiddle would now be passed to a young person in the camp.We found our taxi. Colm’s original fiddle was sitting on the back seat. It, too, was an ancient piece: it sat there, speaking to us.• Apeirogon by Colum McCann is published by Bloomsbury on 25 February (£18.99).

Sellers will in turn be encouraged by the increase in demand and are likely to start putting their properties on the market in greater numbers, and the increase in sales could see prices bounce back quite quickly.“We have already seen how quickly confidence can rebound, with the pound surging to its highest level since June last year and the FTSE 250 hitting record highs, and buyers should consider acting sooner rather than later, while prices are still at attractive levels compared to the last market peak.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6fc1be1578d120f43cf9e6bc57c16a849e186c6/0_1333_3345_2007/master/3345.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ea77e78959487bbd0a2e744e27fcd84","title":"is it a good idea to port my mortgage to buy my partners home","story":"Our plan is to sell my house, move into hers and then sell that and buy one togetherQ My partner and I both own our own homes but we’re planning to move in together soon. Our plan is for me to sell my house, then move in with my partner at her house. Shortly afterwards she would sell her house and we will then buy a new house together. This is to avoid setting up a complicated chain which will make it difficult to complete a purchase.My house is worth around £140,000 and I have a mortgage balance of around £90,000. Her house is worth around £110,000 and she has a mortgage balance of £50,000.The problem is, I have four years left on my fixed-rate mortgage and so will have to pay an early repayment charge of £4,000 if I sell up now. She only has one year left on her fixed-rate mortgage and would only have to pay a fee of £500. So it would be better financially for her to sell first and for me to sell next and then port my mortgage to the new joint property which won’t cost me anything. However, for various reasons, that’s not a practical option.So it occurred to me that I could buy my partner’s house from her when I sell mine. That way I could port my mortgage to her house, then port my mortgage to the new house after that, avoiding my early repayment charge both times. Does this plan make sense and save us money? Are there any pitfalls I have missed? I haven’t been able to find any good advice on this because mortgage advisers just want to sell you a mortgage. RLA It is certainly a cunning plan but whether it’s a plan that makes sense is largely down to your lender’s view. “Porting” your mortgage means taking out a new – but same-sized – mortgage on a different property but keeping the same lender, interest rate and terms and conditions as you currently have. As you are abundantly aware, the main reason for porting a mortgage is to avoid paying early repayment charges which typically apply if you pay off your mortgage before a fixed-rate or discounted period is over.Being able to port your mortgage to a new property is not automatic, however. You will need to go through the mortgage application process using the details of the property you intend to move to – in your case, your partner’s house. Your lender will assess your application using its current lending criteria – which may have changed since your original mortgage application, as may your personal circumstance – so your lender could turn you down. If your lender does allow you to port your mortgage, you need to be aware that it won’t cost nothing because you’ll be expected to pay a fee for your lender’s valuation of your new property. You also need to know that if you want a mortgage bigger than £90,000 when you come to buy your joint home, you won’t necessarily get the same interest rate as now and any top-up loan could be at a much less favourable rate. So that’s something you might also want to chat to your lender about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31700c111c9a9864bf1b53a5cf73a8ba3e2c900/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dea26350f59b9bda1a0c1416b531309a","title":"dreaming of a green christmas heres how to make it come true","story":"Our extravagance is prodigious, and alternatives are not easy, but here are some useful ideasAre you dreaming of a green Christmas? Households and iniduals across the UK are turning their backs on the vulgarity of Christmas consumerism and waste by cutting back on obvious and most visible areas of excess such as unwanted gifts, plastic trees and decorations and unrecyclable wrapping paper.But the scale of our extravagance remains shocking. The Bank of England has calculated that the average UK household will splurge £800 extra in December on food and drink as well as gifts. Included in this is an average of 17 gifts bought per inidual, according to online retailer Amazon.Fresh trees are the more eco-friendly choice, as long as they are from a sustainable source. There are now well over 400 Christmas tree growers across the UK registered with the British Christmas Tree Growers’ Association, where trees are grown to guidelines governing sustainable cultivation. Look also for the FSC certification logo or Soil Association organic certification which means that no pesticides have been used during growing. You could also choose a tree with roots so that it can be replanted and enjoyed year after year.Artificial, plastic trees need to be used for up to nine years in order to have less environmental impact than natural alternatives, depending on how they are disposed of. However local charity shops may accept them for resale if they are in good condition.A 2-metre (6.5ft) artificial tree has a carbon footprint equivalent to about 40kg of greenhouse gas emissions – which is more than twice that of a real tree that ends its life in landfill and more than 10 times that of a real tree that is burned.Many consumers are also now opting to rent trees – complete with lights and decorations. Check your local garden centres or plant nursery, which will usually also deliver and collect the tree to save you the hassle.Among alternatives, Waitrose is selling a 30cm-high “edible” rosemary tree, shaped like its traditional counterpart, which can be used as a decoration or a Christmas table centrepiece. Friends of the Earth suggests that in smaller spaces indoor plants such as yucca or palm trees could be perked up with decorations.Buy less and buy local. Each Christmas, a staggering 4,000 tonnes of products arrive in the UK by container from China. Presents bought locally means you will be supporting small suppliers and makers, while minimising your carbon footprint. Initiatives such as Small Business Saturday help, but support local retailers at other times too. Through its #AirWeShare campaign the environmental charity Hubbub urges shoppers to consider more environmentally friendly options for online shopping, including switching to a click and collect service to reduce the amount of city centre deliveries.The Carbon Trust says gifts that don’t consume electricity, such as toys and books, tend to have a lower carbon footprint than those that do. Buying good quality toys means they can be passed on to friends, family and charity shops, giving them a second or even a third life.And think whether you have to buy physical gifts? Could you buy an “experience” instead? Try gift tokens, cinema tickets, museum membership and so on. Sponsor an animal, buy some rainforest to protect, or even have a stab at making your own, including foodie gifts such as chutneys and cookies.Emi Murphy, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Christmas presents don’t need to cost the earth. By shopping around a little you can find unique gifts that support the fight against the climate crisis, keep plastic out of our oceans and boost tree cover.”Choose decorations wisely and keep them to use again. As tinsel can’t be recycled, try to limit how much you buy, and keep what you have to use year on year. Most tinsel sold in the UK is made in China (and of dubious quality), although John Lewis’s is made in a factory in Wales (which churns out 12,000km a year, enough if laid end to end to get from the UK to South Africa).Wrapping paper is one of the most wasted materials at Christmas. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimates that last year’s wasted paper would be enough to wrap up Guernsey. If we all recycled just half the 8,000 tonnes produced we’d save 25,000 trees.When wrapping steer clear of anything shiny, plastic-lined or decorated with glitter, which are not recyclable. Try the “scrunch” test – anything that doesn’t hold its shape when scrunched into a ball is not recyclable. Use salvageable materials like newspaper, brown paper, textiles, string, raffia (made from bark which regenerates) and vintage ribbon. Wrapping in newspaper (try the distinctive Eyewitness photo double page spread in the middle of the  which my family has been doing for years) looks better than it sounds. Increasingly popular and Instagrammable is wrapping with brightly coloured fabric – based on the traditional Japanese art of furoshiki.Ditch the commercial Christmas crackers which are typically dusted with glitter (containing microplastics) and contain ghastly plastic toys that nobody wants anyway. Make your own (Lakeland and Hobbycraft do handy packs of “fill your own”) and invite your guests to make their own hats.Homelessness charities say you can best help by donating directly to them in order to maximise resources. St Mungo’s, for example, says £25 would pay for a health check, £50 could fund a counselling session or £100 could buy resources for the charity’s Recovery College.Check out whether local charities, old people’s homes, homeless shelters and food banks could do with a spare pair of hands. The Trussell Trust welcomes volunteers over Christmas for its 1,200-strong network of food banks across the UK, to help hand out a record number of emergency food parcels.The national food redistribution charity FareShare seeks volunteers at its depots across the UK to help sort food donated by supermarkets and to drive it to recipients such as charities and community projects serving up meals.You can also help FareShare by choosing a green token through its Community Matters “green token” scheme on Waitrose over Christmas. A similar scheme is FoodCycle, which welcomes volunteers for its 34 projects across the UK.Loneliness is always an issue at Christmas. You can volunteer or donate to Age UK, which says there are 1.4 million “chronically lonely” older people in England alone.If you are stuck when choosing what to cook, the Carbon Trust points out that turkey has a lower carbon footprint than beef, while vegetarian and vegan options are even lower than that. If you can’t steer clear of red meat make sure it’s British. Don’t overdo the cheeseboard, which has a high carbon footprint. Don’t preheat the oven for too long, or leave it on after the meal is prepared to keep food heated.And eat up those leftovers.It’s hard but not impossible to have a plastics-free Christmas. Food packaging is tricky, but supermarket chain Iceland is offering customers the choice of a plastic-free or reduced plastic packaging Christmas dinner this year. It is selling 18 Christmas products that are completely free from plastic packaging, including stuffing balls and black forest layered pavlova. Selfridges is removing plastic packaging from its own brand range of Christmas food, switching to home compostable alternatives for 90,000 mince pies and 3,000 Christmas cakes.Hundreds of thousands of people will be criss-crossing the UK over the holiday, driving significant distances to visit family and friends – what some environmentalists refer to as “love miles” – adding to greenhouse gases and congestion. Avoid air travel if at all possible.Where a large number of people are travelling, the Carbon Trust advises people to check to see whether they can share a car or take public transport (though the railways are not for the faint-hearted at this time of year). Use car sharing websites and apps such as Liftshare and GoCarShare – sharing a journey means a lower carbon footprint for each passenger, less traffic on the roads, splitting fuel costs and hopefully enjoying some company. It urges people to consider a Skype chat rather than a visit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7679c932ee4d1c93b3633b4b97422fff893d117/0_232_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45cb25ef66ab724e8a25b203c1e1430f","title":"election 2019 john crace on the lowlights and the gaffes","story":"’s political sketch writer, John Crace, runs through the highs and the many, many lows of the 2019 general election campaign.

The Salford MP and shadow business secretary performed well as a stand-in for Jeremy Corbyn in leadership debates.During the election campaign, Long-Bailey spearheaded promotion of the party’s plan for a green jobs revolution and was forced to tackle tough questions over its decision to soften its stance on hitting net-zero carbon emissions.Her father was a Salford docker and trade union representative, and she worked in several service industry jobs before qualifying as a solicitor. But given her close alliance with Corbyn and the left, and the rejection delivered by the electorate on Thursday, members may be nervous.The shadow foreign secretary had a quiet election campaign, which was viewed in some quarters as a sign she would run for leader if Labour lost the election. Others believed she was being kept quiet due to her remain position. She has been faultlessly loyal to Corbyn, despite not always having been on his leftwing side of the party. As a “girly swot”, she believes she is good at taking on Boris Johnson. In her acceptance speech in Islington South and Finsbury, she said: “The real fight has to begin now.”Thornberry will have to fight allegations of being part of the “metropolitan elite”. The image has plagued her ever since she tweeted a picture in 2014 of a house in the Rochester and Strood constituency adorned with three flags of St George and the owner’s white van parked outside, provoking accusations of snobbery. She resigned from her shadow cabinet position shortly afterwards. Thornberry’s formative years may have informed her politics. Her parents orced when she was seven years old and she moved into a council house with her mother. She and her siblings took free school meals. But her politics remain elusive. She voted against her own government under Blair and Brown but backed Yvette Cooper in the 2015 leadership campaign. As shadow foreign secretary, she has always trodden a careful line that does not stray too far from the leadership on issues such as Russia, Israel and Trident.The ambitious former director of public prosecutions has led the charge for remain in the shadow cabinet. He has held his Holborn and St Pancras seat since 2015 and been instrumental in shifting Labour’s position towards backing a second Brexit referendum. The party’s stance on Brexit has been blamed by some for the staggering defeat suffered by Labour on Friday. This means Starmer’s ownership of the direction taken could prove problematic if he tries to convince the membership to appoint him as their leader.Away from Brexit, his politics are less clear. Prior to taking the role of DPP, he worked as a defence lawyer specialising in human rights issues. The Human Rights Act and the broader aspects of the constitution in the UK are in the sights of the Conservative government, so his expertise in this area could be a strong sell.Starmer is the only male runner on this list. There have long been calls for the next Labour leader to be a woman, including most recently from McDonnell. McDonnell himself, once considered to be a potential candidate, has ruled himself out, as has Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary. The Conservatives frequently goad Labour over the fact the party has never had a woman as leader and the Tories have had two female PMs.The shadow education secretary, a close friend of Long-Bailey’s, said in recent days she would like to support a Labour Brexit deal. She is regarded as a powerful public speaker and was praised for her interventions during the campaign. Some senior Conservatives said they would fear her as an adversary.On her policy brief, her most controversial moments focused on private schools, which she believes should no longer be subsidised through charitable status.Rayner’s life is often described as inspirational. She grew up on a council estate in Stockport her mother couldn’t read or write. She left school without any qualifications, got pregnant at 16 and left home to bring the child up alone. She qualified as a social care worker and became Unison’s most senior official in the north-west of England. She describes herself as “soft left” and backed Andy Burnham in the 2015 leadership election.The MP for Birmingham Yardley is a strong media performer who has built up a significant public profile from the backbenches. Her fiery speeches and witty barbs aimed at the Conservatives, including the prime minister, frequently go viral online. She is also considered a passionate advocate for her constituency and issues on the ground therein.Corbyn-supporting Labour members are likely to be deeply suspicious of her, as she has frequently been critical of his leadership and the party’s approach to antisemitism.She has not formally announced her candidacy but wrote a piece for the Observer after the election, which many have viewed as the start of her bid for leadership. The piece discussed the issues of trust with Labour on the doorstep and the challenge of bringing back working-class voters.The Wigan MP has said she is seriously thinking about running for the leadership. In a piece for the , Nandy said she believed that, taken inidually, many of the policies in Labour’s manifesto were popular with the public and that the election was not won due to any real affection for Boris Johnson or what he stands for.Nandy has built a reputation as a campaigner for her constituency and others like it, many of which have fallen to the Tories. She helped to create the Centre For Towns thinktank and called for compromise over Brexit.A soft-left candidate, she resigned from the shadow cabinet in 2016 over Corbyn’s leadership and handling of the EU referendum. Like Phillips, she may be viewed with suspicion from Corbyn supporters.Yvette Cooper ran against Corbyn for the leadership in 2015 and is viewed as a centrist. Therefore, she would be likely to face an uphill battle to convince the party membership she is the right person for the job.After losing the leadership election, Cooper focused on becoming a prominent figure on the backbenches, delivering scathing blows to the government in the Commons and has mastered the policy detail on Brexit and home affairs, the latter of which she scrutinises in her role as chair of the home affairs select committee.She has been an MP since 1997 and held positions including chief secretary to the Treasury and secretary of state for work and pensions when Labour was in government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a2f2e7856dcdda0f9b849331fcb470832bcaa0d/56_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c67f7420ccc77b11701976e23e703b25","title":"uk not match fit for brexit talks says former may aide raoul ruparel","story":"Raoul Ruparel says Whitehall is not ready to negotiate a wide-ranging agreementThe government is not “match fit” for the next phase of Brexit negotiations, Theresa May’s former special adviser on exiting the EU has said.Raoul Ruparel, who was credited with coming up with the Northern Ireland solution which helped Boris Johnson seal a Brexit deal with the EU, says lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of May’s government.“As it stands, the UK does not yet appear ‘match-fit’ for the next phase of negotiations,” he says.“There is a huge amount of work to be done to flesh out the detail of what the UK wants from its future relationship with the EU, and Whitehall is not yet ready to negotiate such a complex and wide-ranging agreement, nor implement it.”May’s former adviser says that contrary to what many believe “it is possible to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of next year”.But he warns that it could only be “narrow” in scope.In a report for the Institute for Government, Ruparel is scathing about the UK’s approach to negotiations in the first phase.The “real error was the UK never properly considered what approach and structure would suit its own goals best or put forward an alternative” while the EU was constantly on the front foot, with policy decisions translated into legal text before the UK had worked out its own position.He also says much of the work done under the May government in Whitehall will now be irrelevant.His words echo advice from many trade deal experts who say the UK has to learn from its mistakes and set out its wishlists and red lines clearly and publicly as is the convention in international negotiations.The EU has already indicated its red lines before the new government has even got to work on precisely who, or what government department, will lead its negotiations.Talks in February will open with an EU demand of alignment with union rules.EU leaders warned on Friday that the price of a quick deal including tariff-free access to the single market would be agreeing to the level playing field on workers’ rights and environmental protections.Ruparel says one of the main decisions facing Johnson is whether he wants an overarching ambitious deal, known as a “mixed agreement”, covering the entire gamut of the future political relationship, including security, data, aviation, science and education.That would take years to negotiate.The alternative is a deal that “only engages with EU exclusive competence”, one that would only require approval of the commission and the parliament and not inidual governments which, for example, took a year to ratify the EU-Canada deal.The latter would “limit the scope of any agreement, resulting in what might be termed a shallow and narrow future relationship”, he warns.At the moment Whitehall is not set up for a wide-ranging and complex negotiation, he says. There has been speculation that the Department for Exiting the EU could fold, and Ruparel says it is likely that the department will have to be wound down. “Since its inception, the department has suffered from a poorly defined role,” he says.Ruparel says there are three options for negotiations: run a narrow central unit out of No 10 or the Cabinet Office with expert advice feeding in from across Whitehall set up a larger unit within the Cabinet Office with sufficient expertise to challenge other Whitehall departments or revamp the Department for International Trade.Given the limited time to build the team and seal a comprehensive deal with the EU, one option would be to pursue a phased deal.This would mean a targeted narrow Brexit deal by the end of 2020, as the building blocks for “a more ambitious and comprehensive relationship” over time.This, Ruparel warns, would not be supported by businesses, who would favour just one change to their supply chains and operations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19efa6a642c9a2e03379eee638186935fddbf73a/0_96_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f205cd12e31c0e444b74a4145041a8b8","title":"what we learned about the media this election","story":"The campaign saw an unprecedented level of criticism of British journalism Was it the media wot lost it? This general election has seen an unparalleled level of criticism of British journalism, a prime minister who showed it was possible to skip tough interviews without suffering at the ballot box, and an online campaign that pushed the limits of what was previously considered acceptable in UK politics.The aftermath has seen Jeremy Corbyn partly blame the still-powerful Sun and Daily Mail for his defeat, despite the plummeting print circulations of national newspapers. At the same time the Conservatives have turned their fire on the media and are threatening to decriminalise the licence fee – potentially severely undermining the BBC – and look at other ways of changing the way the UK media operates.Here’s what we learned this election campaign.While audiences of 20-somethings have largely abandoned television news altogether, BBC bulletins remain important for reaching older viewers who are more likely to back the Tories. And while print newspaper sales are collapsing and online news audiences growing, right-wing tabloids which relentlessly backed the Conservatives still sell millions of copies a day – and often indirectly help to set the agenda on television, radio, and online. Although it will be months before academic studies drill down in to the results, there remains a simple demographic ide on how people across the political spectrum get their news.“One of the clearest differences is that most of those on the left prefer to get news online, and most of those on the right prefer to get it offline,” said Dr Richard Fletcher of the University of Oxford’s Reuters Institute. “There will undoubtedly be questions about the influence of online media on the election result in the coming weeks, and we should take these questions seriously. But to correctly understand the impact of online media on the election result, we must constantly remind ourselves that the people most likely to have voted Conservative in 2019 are the least likely to have accessed news about the election online.”Ahead of the election there were concerns about foreign manipulation of the electoral process. Although there were some issues – the prime minister refused to let a report into Russian money be released pre-election, and Reddit suggested a Russian-linked account may have helped distribute leaked US-UK trade papers – ordinary, politicised Britons proved more than capable of creating their own fake posts.When the Tory campaign was briefly derailed by a photograph of a child on the floor of Leeds General Infirmary, a viral message spread among Conservative backers that the image had been faked by Labour supporters. Aided by a toxic mix of falling trust in traditional media outlets and Facebook’s hands-off approach to content moderation, the hoax message was spread to millions of people aided by promotion from mainstream journalists and influencers such as former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen.Some of the behaviour of those sharing the message – often older, less tech-savvy Facebook users – was so strange that they were mistaken for coordinated ‘bot farms’. In reality it appears they were just copying and pasting the same message out of enthusiasm and a desire to believe the photo was faked for political reasons.There’s nothing new about the idea of a political leader winning an election by repeating a slogan until they are blue in the face. But the experience of consuming news on a smartphone – where headlines drift into view via push alert notifications from news apps, on Facebook, and through links sent by friends – means that it’s often the only way to cut through the noise. There is limited space for nuanced policy platforms and complicated offers to the electorate if people are not concentrating it’s easier to adopt a policy of ‘endless screaming’ and bombard them with the same message – such as “Get Brexit Done” – through as many different channels as possible.While it might be a case of borrowed nostalgia to pretend that people ever really engaged with every news story they saw on television or in a print newspaper, online data makes it easier to show how widespread this behaviour has become. When the  ran an experiment to record the smartphone screens of volunteers we found that some people consumed their news almost entirely through headlines, few clicked through to the full article, and those that read to the end of a piece were a rarity.The BBC is facing a difficult post-election comedown as it reckons with widespread criticism from both the Conservative government – who accuse it of anti-Brexit bias – and from some Labour supporters who feel it made a series of errors in favour of the Conservatives.Journalists at the corporation fear the damage done by some incidents, such as quoting Conservatives party sources claiming Labour supporters had assaulted a Tory aide at a hospital in Leeds when no such incident took place. Social media helped set the record straight: within an hour a full video of the alleged altercation was online, making clear that the incident was not as Tory sources had described it, killing the story in its tracks.In the past – when political news was focussed on a few broadcaster bulletins and print newspapers – it was possible to have a good idea of what people were reading, watching, and consuming. If a politician made a mistake on television programme watched by 10 million people then it clearly mattered. If a print newspaper sold 4m copies a day – as the Sun did in the 1990s – then it clearly mattered. But online audiences are so fragmented that information can reach millions of people without ever being seen by journalists or political campaigns.One Labour MP who nearly lost their Brexit-backing seat told the  that on doorstep after doorstep, people brought up Corbyn’s connections with the IRA after seeing memes and images on Facebook: “It was never used by the Tories in the campaign but there was a separate election going on, which was a Facebook-orientated campaign.”The MP suggested constituents are increasingly overwhelmed by information and unsure what is real and what is not, assuming there is some sort of editing of what goes on Facebook. “People have a sense that some of this stuff is probably wrong but they have no compass. They would say: ‘But it’s on Facebook – how can there be something that isn’t true?’ They think there are gatekeepers but there aren’t.”The 2016 EU referendum and Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election focussed minds on the idea of under-the-radar, paid-for ‘dark ads’ which manipulate small groups of people to vote a certain way. But transparency tools introduced by Facebook and Google, although flawed, made this easier to track.They suggested political advertising in the UK is drifting towards the US model, with blanket ad buys on sites such as YouTube resembling television advertising designed to carpet-bomb voters with simple messages, rather than the more laborious task of manipulating small groups below the radar.It was the election where politicians realised they could attack the media with few downsides. Boris Johnson’s decision to skip a one-on-one primetime television interview with Andrew Neil provoked fury from Labour, especially after they had agreed to put Corbyn up for scrutiny. But Tory strategists decided – apparently correctly – that a tough interview with Neil could be substantially more damaging than a few stories about Johnson refusing to take part in a television programme. The real concern, according to Tory campaign insiders, was about clips from the interview going viral.Television stations used to be able to set the terms of engagement because they were one of the only ways for politicians to reach a mass audience. The debacle over the Neil interview, combined with Labour and the Tories working together to keep the Lib Dems and the SNP out of the televised leaders’ debates, showed the power may now lie with the politicians, with potential implications for the next election. That’s if the broadcasters survive in their current form – with the new Tory government targeting both the BBC and Channel 4."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cbc2767cfef4c9e3a90b457ef335854b32d8245/0_1590_3425_2054/master/3425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641862a5202cf7b89073a1435cd432f3","title":"my working week appalling houses clients live feel sick","story":"I work to support tenants who are being exploited by criminal landlords and are sometimes living in dangerous conditionsWe arrive at what looks like an abandoned car repair garage. Led by the police, we go inside and see rows of empty bunk beds in a makeshift bedroom, with lightbulbs dangling from the ceiling. I feel sick when I realise people have been living here.The council shuts it down immediately for health and safety reasons. My colleague and I speak to a tenant who was sleeping when we arrived, advising him on his rights and options for relocation.Back in the office, I warn my colleagues that I’m stressed – two of my clients face eviction proceedings in court this week. A third client, Jenny, is living in a property that has been investigated by the environmental health team for disrepair. She is struggling to source the money for a deposit and rent in advance on a new property.I open the case file for Anita, who has been living in a bedbug-infested rental property for several years with her mother and two children. She has been getting threatening notes through the letterbox telling her to get out. She believes they are being sent by the agent she pays rent to, who has also applied to the county court to evict her. My colleague and I spend the day combing the eviction paperwork in search of an error that might allow us to get the case struck out. We find one.I spend the day on the phone going back and forth between Jenny and her landlord, trying to negotiate a deal so that the landlord can provide her with money for the deposit and rent in advance. He has just bought the property and wants to renovate it to increase the rental value, but knows Jenny will not be able to afford the higher rent.Feeling intimidated by the landlord, but simultaneously priced out of alternative accommodation in the London borough that she has lived and worked in all her life, Jenny is trapped in substandard housing. The landlord and I make an agreement that will provide her with the money for a new flat by Friday.Anita’s hearing is at 10am. Going to court is the most nerve-racking part of my job: for many of the families I work with, the stakes are staggeringly high. The consequence of losing could be homelessness, or having a county court debt which could amount to thousands of pounds registered against their names.As we enter the courtroom Anita flinches in fear at the sight of the agent and the barrister that he has instructed, but the judge is unimpressed by the myriad of errors they have made in their application and dismisses the case. We have won, and I could almost cry with relief.I wake up to an email from Jenny to say the funds for the deposit and rent in advance have landed in her account and I do a little dance on my way to the tube. Unfortunately, there’s no time for celebration as it’s back to court for the eviction hearing of Ellie and her flatmates, who rent from a portfolio landlord with a cavalier attitude to gas and fire safety.He employs a top barrister to take on his unrepresented tenants. But the lawyer becomes visibly furious when the judge, unconvinced by the stream of legalese, dismisses the case. A successful week, but it’s far from ‘problem solved’ for my clients: they’re now forced into the bottom end of the London rental market, where appalling living conditions and criminal landlord behaviour are the norm rather than the exception.All names have been changedIf you would like to contribute to our My working week series about your job in public services, get in touch by emailing sarah.johnson@the"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42e3ec81eff248142abdf3cf94e91406c48239d9/74_0_3352_2012/master/3352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e6d8408bbc098dd422a08049649b45d","title":"ben stokes modesty contrast bloated show","story":"At the end of a joyful and often inspirational process marked by honesty, humility, a roster of outstanding candidates and the willingness of all parties to submit to multiple interviews, a public vote resulted in a richly deserved winner. Ben Stokes, who well before polling opened had made his first appearance on the programme as one of three England cricketers introduced by Gary Lineker as “World Cup run-out hero Jason Roy, captain Eoin Morgan and main award winner Ben Stokes” was indeed presented with the main award. Lineker’s faux pas was swiftly corrected, and surely a slip of the tongue rather than evidence of outlandish vote-rigging, with Stokes already the bookmakers’ runaway favourite and England’s cricketers also providing the team and moment of the year.So concluded a broadcast that had started some four hours earlier, with the BBC so excited by the stars’ arrival that they broadcast it twice. Radzi Chinyanganya and Amy Irons helmed a vaguely serious main programme while Reece Parkinson and the singer and Fulham forward Chelcee Grimes did a more chaotic youth-culture version, both simultaneously broadcast on the red button (the colour of which is precisely the kind of completely invented pro-Labour bias the new government is so angry about, and the content of which is precisely the kind of completely unnecessary fluff that the BBC will have to can as a result). This meant that for much of the time a majority of the people on the red carpet were being employed to interview people on the red carpet, and that they often had little option but to simply interview each other. “What are you looking forward to after the show? Last year there was this mad cheese fondue,” asked Grimes of Parkinson. “What is it that you want to ask Dina Asher-Smith?” asked Parkinson of Grimes – one of the key themes of this period was interviewers interviewing other interviewers about the prospect of interviewing someone who wasn’t an interviewer – and also: “Are we really going to ask Ben Stokes to put his hand inside the sack?”This sack was a Christmas stocking stuffed with random questions written on little slips of paper. Stokes was asked which TV character he would choose to be and, perhaps unwisely given his history, plumped for Peaky Blinders’ Tommy Shelby, who is known for being extremely violent around pubs. Nicola Adams was asked for the most ridiculous fact she knew, prompting a completely blank expression and a very awkward silence, which ended only when Grimes interjected with a story about her teeth and something about the reproductive system of seahorses.Delivery of infant seahorses has one key similarity with winning the Sports Personality of the Year award: it is done by males. Not since Zara Phillips in 2006 has a woman received the honour, and of the two women on this year’s shortlist the first to be introduced on the main stage, Katarina Johnson-Thompson, did not exactly help her prospects of victory by admitting her hope that “2020’s going to be my year”. As if, with only breaking the British heptathlon record in winning at the world championships in October to boast about, this one had been a little underwhelming.Asher-Smith had been “honoured to be considered part of the top six” while Stokes also played down his achievements. “People have said this year’s been redemption,” he said. “It’s not, I’ve just been out there doing my job. I don’t know if I’ve explained that very well.”Raheem Sterling, who was still playing a game against Arsenal as the broadcast commenced, had a good excuse for being absent Lewis Hamilton, interviewed from an unspecified family event, did not. “Sorry I’m not there tonight, I’m here,” he said. Curiously, when he was named runner-up, in the live vote his trophy turned out to be “here” also.The modesty of the nominees stood in contrast to an occasion that as ever tended towards the bloated, buffed and boastful. Some presenters seemed convinced that this is, in fact, the most important occasion in sport. “When you think about this, where does this rank in terms of your own sporting achievements,” someone actually asked the two-time Olympic gold-medallist Kelly Holmes about the prospect of being part of a four-person team pedalling the trophy into Aberdeen’s P\u0026ampJ Live Arena.But there were also moments of genuine poignancy and emotion. Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson did not even make it to the stage dry-eyed as her lifetime of achievement was celebrated, while the winner of the Helen Rollason award for achievement in the face of adversity, Doddie Weir – who irrespective of his other achievements deserved recognition for his mustard-and-blue tartan suit alone – was a source of both inspiration and humour. “As a Scottish rugby player in the 90s, this is the closest I ever got to a trophy,” he quipped.It is a fact of sport that the more trophies you get, the better your chances of picking up more, as the night’s big winner would once again prove."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7c568d1aef8b128b7876db1e7e2e729d00afb4b/11_32_1898_1139/master/1898.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4824ee510f82e113855c209331777270","title":"chess champion magnus carlsen top of world fantasy football rankings premier league","story":"Magnus Carlsen, the world’s best chess player for the last decade, is leading the Premier League’s official fantasy football table, beating over seven million players.The grandmaster is enjoying his best season ever in the Fantasy Premier League (FPL) game and held on to top spot on Sunday after moving to the summit thanks to a fine Saturday in which his captain, Mohamed Salah of Liverpool, scored twice to earn 32 points.Upon reaching the top of the standings he changed his Twitter profile to reflect his lofty position, it now reads: “World Chess Champion. The highest ranked chess player in the world. Current (live) #1 Fantasy Premier League player.”Carlsen currently leads the standings by one point, but could be overhauled on Monday by the second-placed Nick Tanner, the former Liverpool and Bristol Rovers defender, with his team “winorloseonthebooze”. Monday’s evening kick-off in the Premier League sees Crystal Palace host Brighton, and with Carlsen having no players in his starting XI to Tanner’s three (Brighton’s Matt Ryan and Lewis Dunk, plus Palace’s Martin Kelly), the chess player could easily be knocked off his perch.Carlsen claims his success in fantasy football is down to luck. The chess champion’s team, Kjell Ankedal, finished among the top 3,000 players in the 2017–2018 league, following three other impressive seasons.It took Carlsen just six weeks to make it into the top 1,000 this season and he has been mounting a charge for the top ever since. Asked to comment on his success this season, Carlsen cited the Opta data used by FPL players to track footballing form. “In fantasy football I’m both an optimist and an Optamist,” he told the  in a one line email.Carlsen, like many Norwegians, is obsessed with both the Premier League and its fantasy league spin-off. In 2017, eight players from Norway were in the top 50 FPL players in the world.According to chess journalist Tarjei Svensen, who has known Carlsen since he was eight and follows all of his games. “His ability at fantasy league has been known for a couple of seasons now, but this season has been exceptional and he’s had another good week,” Svensen said.He added: “His rise up the charts is incredible. He had a really good year for a while last season and then he dropped a couple of hundred places at the end of the season, but he was still in the top 1,000.”Svensen reckons Carlsen excels at FPL because of a phenomenal memory for Premier League details. His level of knowledge about English football is amazing, which must help him a lot,” he says.When he was asked about the success of his FPL team on Norwegian TV in October, Carlsen was worried such questions would jinx his performance. Still, he climbed from 162 in the table to the top three.Carlsen said: “In chess, you know when you’ve done well and when you’ve done poorly, but it’s hard for me to take praise for fantasy league, when I’ve just been lucky.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69c705df9ffea8063e464fcee8e80d02c185a7f7/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e956656640ed7e70bae985a783b7b8a","title":"rugby union talking points champions cup action","story":"Exeter are the only Premiership side in pole position to secure a quarter-final spot after an attritional weekendIt should be the pool of death given that three of its occupants are heading their respect leagues. Leinster are at the top of their Pro14 conference, unbeaten since last May, Lyon head the Top 14, 10 points ahead of Montpellier, who are third, while Northampton look down on the rest in the Premiership. There is a code in Europe that league form cannot crack. Lyon have won away to Toulon and Racing 92 this season, but they lost in Treviso on Saturday to all but end their interest in the Champions Cup while the Saints won in Italy only after a final flourish. Leinster, who became the first team to qualify for the last eight after four rounds, learned the painful way, like Munster and Saracens, that Europe is a long step up from league rugby. Paul ReesExeter need just one point from their remaining two fixtures against Glasgow and La Rochelle to be certain of topping the pool, making them the only English side currently on track to claim a home quarter-final. Succeeding in both competitions, as Saracens did last year, is not easy and Exeter’s director of rugby, Rob Baxter, is taking nothing for granted. “We’ve got to go away to Leicester next week and then we’ve got Saracens here. They’re going to be two hugely challenging games. Leicester aren’t going to go bumbling along the bottom of the Premiership with the quality of players they’ve got. They’re just not. We’ve got to make sure we don’t draw a big breath, go up to Leicester and underperform. The important thing for us is to park this, get selection right, get some energy back into the team and refocus very quickly on the Premiership around the Christmas period. If not, those challenges are going to hit us just as hard as they’ve hit everybody else.” Glasgow, meanwhile, are all but out after a late red card to Matt Fagerson deprived them of the chance to beat La Rochelle at the death. Robert KitsonWhat a nightmare Europe is proving for Bath. They were always going to struggle away in Clermont having lost their opening three pool games but to concede 40 points before half-time is truly grim. Along with Harlequins, well beaten at home by Ulster, they are out of Europe already and both clubs can only hope that there is some more joy to be had domestically. If not this is going to be a long, painful campaign, particularly with their England contingent set to disappear away to the Six Nations in the new year. Exeter aside, this has been a sobering campaign for the Premiership’s representatives, who have found the task of battling on two fronts after the World Cup almost impossible. Other countries have had to face exactly the same challenge, however, and a number of their problems would appear to lie closer to home. Robert KitsonInteresting constitutional issues arise from the prominent turning point of pool four on Saturday. EPCR has confirmed it will be investigating the incident in which one of Munster’s medical staff is said to have made unsavoury comments about Jamie George’s weight, which incensed the normally equable hooker. From that, all hell broke loose as most of the players on the field – and a few off – joined in a brawl that spilled dangerously close to some heavy, sharp-looking camera equipment beyond the hoardings. From out of the melee, the referee decided to penalise Owen Farrell – because he was captain and had come in from 10 metres to join the fray – which gave Munster the chance, owing to the intervention of one of their own staff, to extend their lead. As it happens, they missed, and it was Saracens, instead, who took inspiration from the incident. Bystanders influencing events on the field? It shouldn’t happen for any number of reasons. The case, as they say, continues. Michael AylwinToulouse are all but through to the quarter-finals after coming from behind to secure a bonus-point victory at Montpellier. The race is for second place, a position currently held by Gloucester even though they have won just one of their four matches while Connacht, their conquerors in Galway on Saturday, have secured two victories. Gloucester left Ireland with two bonus points, but a club that won their opening two Premiership matches have lost their way with six defeats in seven matches in the league and Europe since then. They are fashioning different ways to lose and were 24-13 ahead in Connacht with four minutes to go before conceding two tries. As things stand, pools three and four should supply two of the three runners-up in the quarter-finals. Gloucester and Connacht are vying with Northampton and Glasgow for the other and it may be that the one who goes through secures 15 points or fewer, showing the domination of the five group leaders.

The Diversity In Racing Steering Group, set up by the sport’s ruling body, used its annual update to urge racing people to embrace change and noted with impressive understatement that, to spectators, “some areas of the sport could be seen as out of kilter with modern British society, from the composition of the sport’s leadership and the opportunities afforded to participants”.The steering group has set out four objectives for itself, including raising awareness of the importance of ersity in racing and to increase the number of riding opportunities for female jockeys. “This is not just about gender there are minority groups that are not truly included in our sport … By making racing for everyone, the industry has an opportunity to appeal to the next generation as fans and employees, to sponsors, to government, and to compete with other sports and leisure activities.”Few trainers have made it to the century club as fast as Archie Watson, who amassed 105 winners in 2018, his third season as a trainer. He has surpassed that with 130 this year and has maintained a remarkable level of consistency as, for each of the last 37 months, he has sent out two winners or more.Even as we approach the shortest day, he continues to bang in the winners. It looks worth taking a chance with his maiden juvenile Manap (6.10) at Wolverhampton.The son of Sepoy had his only run at Lingfield in June when, having proved difficult to load, he was well behind early and, according to his jockey, was running incredibly green. It seems the penny dropped late in the race as he stayed on in the final stages and was nearest at the finish. He hasn’t run for 177 days but Watson has found what appears to be a very weak race. The big danger would be Punting, but Watson has a terrific record for sorting out problems with his horses and Manap will be a very interesting runner at 8-1 or so.A young rider who is starting to make a name for herself is Page Fuller, a conditional jockey based with in-form trainer Jamie Snowden. Fuller has won 18 races this season, level with her personal best of last term. Of that number, half were for Snowden, but she also struck up a good understanding with Zoe Davison, riding four winners from 22 rides for her this term.They team up again at Plumpton with Scrutinise (2.15) in the two-mile handicap hurdle. Fuller and the son of Intense Focus finished third, beaten a neck, in their first race together and she got the best out of the seven-year-old to win by five lengths last time at this track. He was given a 6lb hike by the handicapper for that impressive win and that would not appear to be harsh.

Today, the Friends of Friendless churches keep the doors open to more than 50 of these treasuresThe Friends of Friendless Churches (FoFC) is a small charity that works to save places of worship across England and Wales, many of which face abandonment and ruin as a result of shrinking populations in rural areas.Founded in 1957 by Welsh journalist and former MP Ivor Bulmer-Thomas – a leading layman in the Church of England – the charity aims to preserve beautiful churches as public monuments that should be rightly recognised as “dispersed world heritage sites” and important components of our cultural legacy. The founding members included politician Roy Jenkins, artist John Piper, poet TS Eliot, and poet and conservation campaigner John Betjeman.According to Friends director Rachel Morley, through his vociferous campaigning Bulmer-Thomas “almost singlehandedly changed the fate of parish churches”. Having witnessed the demolition of St Peter the Less Church in Chichester in 1960, he vowed to prevent similar acts of cultural vandalism from occurring again. Bulmer-Thomas believed that “an ancient and beautiful church fulfils its primary function merely by existing. It is, in itself, and irrespective of the members using it, an act of worship. Their message is delivered – not for half hours on Sundays, but every hour of every day of every year, and not merely to those who enter, but to all who pass by.”Though Bulmer-Thomas was himself a devoted churchgoer, the mission of the Friends is not a religious one. Morley says that “we are an architectural conservation organisation”, and the aim of the Friends is to preserve beautiful places of worship as public monuments. The churches are, according to Morley, our “greatest architectural and cultural legacy … equivalent to the great cultural treasures of places such as Tuscany, Istanbul and Andalucía.”The Venerable Ambrose Mason, Archdeacon of Monmouth, says: “It is the local congregation that has the responsibility for looking after the buildings, their repair and maintenance, and if something really serious crops up – a congregation of perhaps elderly people say ‘we just can’t raise a quarter of a million pounds to repair the roof’,” so, in many cases, the decision has to be made to “walk away from the building”.This often results in churches being labelled as “unviable”, after which alternative uses for them are sought by church authorities. Morley says: “In the 1950s, many were demolished, whereas now there are better systems in place within the church commissioners and the diocese for finding an outcome.” However, this often means the buildings slip out of the “shared national heritage” into private ownership – converted into private dwellings or offices with little to no public access. Archdeacon Mason says the Friends “provide a vital role in helping to preserve the more significant local churches where the congregations have dropped to a point where they are not viable”.Morley says “These buildings are beautiful and important in and of themselves. We do not need to justify their continued existence by turning them into cafes or social security offices. The parish churches of England and Wales contain the most important art and architecture and they are vulnerable.” Many churches that are sold often appear cheap at point of purchase but due to the expense of conversion – few have electricity or water – fall into disrepair and are left locked and abandoned.The Friends has a membership of 2,000 and relies on a network of 200 volunteers around the country to keep their eyes on the buildings. Julia Pound happily describes herself as an “accidental church warden” after moving in to the property next door to Ayshford Chapel, which is cared for by the Friends. She describes her role as “sweeping it out once a week and making sure it looks loved”.In the case of St Mary the Virgin in Llanfair Kilgeddin, in Monmouthshire, the church has been cared for by a local man, Maurice Trumper, for over 25 years . The church was saved from demolition in the 1980s in what Friends chairman Roger Evans described as “a rallying point for the conservation movement” following a “tooth and nail” battle with the Church in Wales to save it. The church, an Arts and Crafts masterpiece with its original, fully restored sgrafitto paneling by George Heywood Sumner, is now the Friends’ “pride and joy”, according to Evans.Morley gives the example of the sgrafitto panels at Llanfair when describing the importance of the churches being viewed in the context of the landscapes around them. One extraordinary panel, O ye Mountains and Hills, features the landscape directly outside the church walls – the River Usk, Sugar Loaf Mountain and the tower of the nearby church of St Michael’s in Llanfihangel Gobion. Before the Friends intervention in the 1980s, the panels were scheduled to be pulled out and sent to a museum, while the rest of the building was demolished. Morley says: “The art and artwork in churches is worthy of being in any national museum. What is brilliant is that it is in context, and that could be in the middle of a field or sitting at the side of a road, and that is hugely important. Most of our churches are open 247 and we want the public to enjoy them and celebrate them because we are so lucky to have them.”The perseverance on behalf of the local communities surrounding the churches is demonstrated by the case of St Mary of the Angels in Brownshill, Gloucestershire, when in 2011 villagers purchased the church from the diocese and entrusted its care to the Friends in perpetuity. One of the great fears of the FoFC is that short-sighted decisions on behalf of church authorities looking to balance the books could seriously and irrevocably damage the nation’s greatest architectural legacy – removing centuries old buildings from existence or public access over the course of a single generation. Nearly half of the Grade I-listed buildings in England are churches, and around 30 are put up for sale or closed every year.The Friends receive no public funding in England and only modest support from the Church of Wales. Otherwise, they are entirely reliant on support from their members and donations from the general public. Though many churches petition the Friends for support, they don’t have the budget to rescue all those that are in need. In fact, the organisation has a long list of churches that are under threat or that in some cases have been closed and have stood locked and deteriorating for over 12 years. “There are more churches added to our list every quarter. Some have been on this list for well over a decade,” says Morley.The Friends stress that cared for and cherished should not mean fossilised, and instead they want offer their churches for public events such as concerts, knitting groups, seasonal lectures, art exhibitions, supper clubs and the occasional religious ceremony. They intend to carry on working tirelessly to preserve what Shakespeare described as our magnificent “sermons in stone” for generations to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b0c94b9f2b22cafe23652092d6a37b762ad2c56/0_0_1900_1140/master/1900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c97ddf3ecb10cc1f9c8eec2f5b12d52d","title":"california eucalyptus trees environment comic","story":"The fight over a celebrated exotic plant highlights questions over California’s future amid the climate crisis"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08e67d45c554e1416a0d05e20f37399801fb0de/2810_672_2638_1583/master/2638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641c6a1f2409434d9c09472aa8a21693","title":"weve become like a little family of shops we look out for one another","story":"For Karen Harvey, her shop Hoos is fulfilling a lifelong passion for Scandi design while also breathing welcome new life into her local area, writes  Malcolm Jack “I often get people coming in and asking me what the name of the shop means,” smiles Karen Harvey, founder and owner of Hoos. “Everyone thinks it’s Danish or something. It’s actually just how you say ‘house’ in Scotland,” she laughs, “it’s just a bit of fun.”Be that as it may, it’s a name that captures a lot about what makes Glasgow’s haven of gorgeous Nordic homeware such a unique delight to visit. Both in terms of its synergy of fine Scandi and Scottish design (“hus”, pronounced the same way as Hoos, happens to be the word for “house” in the three main Scandinavian languages), and also its welcoming sense of warmth and character. Never more so than in the run-up to Christmas, when Harvey and her staff embrace the rich northern European tradition of bringing cosy light and comfort to long, dark winter nights, with their twinkling decorations and friendly, personalised approach to helping customers pick just the right presents for family and friends.Home has been at the heart of 63-year-old Harvey’s entire working life, in different ways. For 30 years she lived in Suffolk, leading two charities that did revolutionary things in improving the lives, living circumstances and futures of vulnerable young people (she received an MBE for her services). A mixture of professional and personal circumstances led her back to her native Glasgow a few years ago, where she decided to take an entirely new career direction.“I’ve always had an interest in interiors and design, even though that’s not my background at all,” Harvey explains. “Scandinavian design has always been my sort of personal aesthetic, so when I was thinking: ‘OK, what brands do I want to do?’ they were the only ones for me.” She leased small premises on, at that time, a dilapidated stretch of Great Western Road, just off the west end of Glasgow’s central artery Byres Road, and with the support of her architect partner Bill, cleverly transformed the compact space into an immaculately laid out, bright and inviting oasis of select hard and soft furnishings, cool kitchen and tableware, lush green house plants, stylish rainwear, handmade fashion accessories and other assorted pretty things.Starting a new business in a new sector would be a daunting challenge for anyone, but Harvey took it in her stride. “I had to go to Copenhagen and be interviewed by some of the brands, because they’re very particular about what kind of shops they’re going in to,” Harvey reveals. She evidently impressed, because Hoos has become one of the few stockists in the UK for a host of hip makers such as Hay, Normann Copenhagen and Skagerak, to name just a few. “Most of my jewellery is by Glasgow School of Art graduates,” Harvey explains. “We also do textiles by Scottish makers. You’re not going to find these kinds of things in any other store either.”Business is going strong for Hoos, as it helps lead a local high street revival. Harvey is passionate about fostering a thriving community along Great Western Road, which has seen a host of great vintners, victuallers, boutiques, bookshops, bakers and cafes breathe new life into a historic strip of retail premises. She’s involved with Love Great Western Road, a Business Improvement District (BID) proposal encouraging local businesses to work collectively for a brighter, more prosperous commercial future. “It’s helped us to get to know one another,” Harvey says of BID. “We’ve become like a little family of shops – we look out for one another.”As well as local retailers pulling together to support each other, they all rely on their customers doing the same. By reminding people #WhereYouShopMatters, Visa is championing local, independent retailers to help restore richly deserved focus and footfall to our high streets. Not only because our high streets are at the heart of our communities, but also because great independent traders can offer unique and enriching retail experiences, where staff take a hands-on approach to helping you select special things for yourself and for the important people in your life. Shops like Hoos are working hard to not only redefine what it means to be a small, independent trader in the digital age, but also help revitalise our high streets for a new generation, and they deserve to be shouted about for it.“I’m really encouraged by Visa’s #WhereYouShopMatters initiative,” says Hoos’s Karen Harvey, “because it brings businesses like ours to people’s attention. Particularly among younger people, who I think are the ones who increasingly do most of their shopping online. If it brings Hoos to their attention for maybe the first time, obviously that’s fab. And then they’ll come to Great Western Road more often and see all the other fabulous shops too.”Here are some of Harvey’s top tips for great Christmas shopping experiences in her local area:Love and Squalor“A small shop just past Kelvinbridge. Rebecca is the owner and she sells clothes that she handmakes herself. So it’s like going back to how it used to be many years ago. She also buys in things such as wonderful socks and lovely Irish scarves, blankets and candles. It’s just a really nice experience going in there.”427 Great Western Road, Kelvinbridge, G4 9JACottonrake Bakery“A fabulous independent bakery, doing wonderful bread, cakes and bakes. In the run-up to Christmas they do all kinds of special things such as Christmas jams and other nice little presents. We feel extremely lucky to have them nearby.”497 Great Western Road, G12 8HLPaulin Watches“Everyone loves a watch – particularly a handmade one. Paulin’s designs are beautiful.

The bodies of two people are still missing.New Zealanders observed a minute’s silence on Monday afternoon to commemorate the disaster. Ardern was in a cabinet meeting, where ministers observed the event, and Judy Turner, the mayor of Whakatane – the town closest to the island – led a moment of remembrance there for hundreds of mourners, according to Radio New Zealand.Specialists from New Zealand’s military hoped to return to Whakaari on Monday to search the nearby waters for two bodies that they could not find during a perilous recovery mission to the island on Friday. During that trip – a gruelling and physically demanding operation – the bodies of six of the eight people unaccounted for were found.Divers returned to the island on Sunday to look for the remaining two, who were believed to be in the ocean off the island, and returned empty-handed weather conditions at sea prevented a recovery mission on Monday.“Police with the navy will continue their recovery operation for the two remaining victims,” Ardern said onMonday, adding that searchers would reassess the risk “each day.”White Island’s volcanic alert status is currently rated at two out of five, the same level of risk as the day it erupted.Whether tourists should have been on New Zealand’s most active volcano last Monday, and whether anyone failed to do anything that could have kept them safe, will be a question for the government agency WorkSafe, in an investigation that is likely to take a year, Ardern said.The inquiry will decide whether charges should be brought against any named iniduals who are found to have violated New Zealand’s workplace health and safety laws. Ardern told reporters at parliament in the capital, Wellington, on Monday that as well as the tour operators who took the visitors to the active volcano when it erupted, cruise ship companies and landowners could also come under scrutiny.Many of the tourists who were visiting White Island when it erupted were passengers on the cruise ship Ovation of the Seas, which was docked in the nearby Port of Tauranga. The island is owned privately by a family from Auckland, who sold leases to four tourism operators.A second investigation by New Zealand’s chief coroner is also under way.Neither inquiry will examine the actions of emergency services in the immediate aftermath of the eruption. The authorities were criticised by some of the grieving families for their decision not to allow first responders to return to the island after an initial trip to rescue survivors due to safety risks.Tourism and legal analysts told the  last week that New Zealand’s “no fault” accident compensation system had given rise to more risk-taking in the adventure tourism sector than was considered acceptable in other countries.The scheme, known as ACC, covers the treatment costs for all accidental injuries in New Zealand but bars the injured from bringing lawsuits for negligence.“I simply do not agree that ACC in any way has led to there being less focus on health and safety issues,” Ardern said, adding there were “regulatory regimes” that managed risks to tourists.Ardern said on Monday that $5million NZD had been set aside to help support small businesses in the area, as well as those on the West Coast of the South Island who were cut off by flooding last week.The small, tourist town of Whakatane, in the economically-deprived region of Bay of Plenty has long been reliant on the tourist draw of White Island as an anchor for its economic survival.A panel of government ministers and public officials would decide on the criteria for distributing the funds, Ardern said. The prime minister said it was also not for her to say whether White Island would be reopened for tour groups in the year that the inquiry would take to complete."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Animal welfare charity says people should wait for a less busy time of year in order to give a puppy the time they needPublican of popular Hi-B bar known for unique way with customers died on FridayMan arrested following attack on woman (30) at a house in Arklow\u0026lsquoUnrealistic\u0026rsquo to expect trade deal by end of 2020 \u0026ndash Killybegs Fishermen\u0026rsquos Organisation CEOWork will continue under reduced board until resolution found to North deadlockPay for male graduates outstrips that for women by \u0026euro130 a week eight years after collegeNew lobby group for apartment owners is seeking Government backing for scheme of redressGenomics Medicine Ireland presenting itself as \u0026lsquonational project\u0026rsquo when owned by multinational investorsMedicine, statistics and engineering graduates earn up to twice that of arts, humanitiesAttorney General issues advice on coal ban following legal threats over the proposalClaim that home-tuition grants were deliberately delayed is rejected by GovernmentState\u0026rsquos 31 local authorities deemed among global best at catering for older peopleDublin City Council says it has \u0026lsquosignificant concerns\u0026rsquo about proposalCompany that is seeking redundancies says wellbeing of staff \u0026lsquoforemost\u0026rsquo in processProtected disclosure says agency breached financial guidelines on property acquisitionMounting concern about running costs \u0026ndash now up to \u0026euro366m annually, from \u0026euro325m in 2017An Bord Plean\u0026aacutela rules council should have granted permission for Abbey Street ventureTasking senior counsel with job mooted as Varadkar says ethics committee ruled out"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4116067.1576433322!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"northern ireland talks to restore assembly set to begin on monday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont has been suspended for three years. Photograph: Paul FaithAFPGetty ImagesMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Northern Secretary Julian Smith are to hold talks with the North’s five main parties in Belfast on Monday in a post-election effort to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly.And while the British prime minister Boris Johnson has yet to name his next cabinet it appears a given that Mr Smith will remain as secretary of state at the Northern Ireland Office.On Sunday Mr Smith tweeted, “Good calls with all five party leaders this morning. Look forward to starting positive process tomorrow to get Stormont back up and running.”He will be joined by Tánaiste Mr Coveney in leading this latest set of negotiations aimed at reinstating the power-sharing institutions which collapsed almost three years ago.While the DUP in particular has been licking its wounds over the weekend following the loss of Nigel Dodds’s seat in North Belfast and Emma Little Pengelly’s in South Belfast, Mr Coveney said he believed all parties were anxious to get Stormont back up and running.Mr Smith has laid down January 13th as the deadline for a deal, warning that if there is no agreement by then he will be obliged to call new Assembly elections.Elections could be especially difficult for the DUP. Sinn Féin’s vote was also down in this election, notwithstanding its success in North Belfast. All five main parties, particularly the DUP and Sinn Féin, were told by the public during the election campaign that they wanted Stormont restored so that pressing issues such as the current health crisis could be addressed by local politicians.All the parties insisted they were anxious to reinstate the Assembly, and Dublin and Belfast believe there is now a real opportunity to break the political deadlock.Irish languageOne of the main blocks to a deal is the Sinn Féin demand for an Irish language act, although there are other difficult obstacles to overcome as well such as dealing with the past and ensuring any restored Assembly is sustainable.A previous contentious issue, same-sex marriage, was legislated for at Westminster, as was the liberalising of abortion law in Northern Ireland.Mr Coveney said that Northern Ireland had had “three years of political stagnation” which has been “damaging and polarising not only for political parties but communities as well”.“We will be ready to go this week to work with the parties and to help them get that foundation in place for a stable Executive…I think all parties have now recognised, including the DUP, that they would like to move on,” he said. “My strong preference, and I think the preference of the majority of parties in Northern Ireland is for an all-party functioning government in Northern Ireland that can work together and try to put the difficulties and polarisation of the last three years behind us and start to actually focus on healing, rather than ision in Northern Ireland.”The DUP Assembly member Edwin Poots said that the focus now must be on restoring the Assembly. “We are a devolutionist party. We want Stormont back. We never wanted Stormont collapsed Sinn Féin collapsed it,” he said.“They have held the country to ransom for the past three years but as we enter these talks the longer they are holding the country to ransom the weaker their position is becoming,” he told BBC Northern Ireland’s Sunday Politics programme.Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said his party also wanted the institutions restored. “But this is not going to be Stormont Mark II. Any institution which comes up again cannot be an institution which discriminates against citizens,” he said.‘Last-chance’SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood said the parties were “entering last-chance talks”. He added, “At the ballot box on Thursday, people across Northern Ireland sent a very clear message ahead of all-party talks this week - it’s time for politicians to get back to work. There were plenty of parties ready to commit to restoring the institutions during TV debates, now they have the opportunity to act accordingly.Alliance leader Naomi Long said that this was the “last chance” to restore the Assembly. She said the clear message from the Westminster election was that people wanted a “new form of politics”.“Every day this impasse continues, the public is suffering – people are losing their jobs, budgets are being slashed, organisations are going to the wall,” she said. “The health service is currently facing a major crisis but that is likely to be followed in the near future by other crises in areas such as education and infrastructure, as well as the impending welfare mitigations cliff edge, and doing our best to protect Northern Ireland from Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal,” she added.“If there is no successful resolution, the Secretary of State must call fresh elections and then it is over to the public to elect those who want to get on with the job of delivering for everyone.”Ulster Unionist Party leader Steven Aiken said there was “little point in rushing back into Stormont simply because the DUP and Sinn Féin have decided that now the election is over they are willing to set their own differences aside”.Any talks must be “on the basis of restoring sustainable, accountable and transparent government,” he added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4116697.1576495042!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"minister criticises miche%C3%A1l martin for pushing for election date","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Social Protection Regina Doherty says there will be an election “if not in the next long number of weeks, definitely in the next couple of months”.

I don’t think it is credible we would reconvene after Easter,” he told Newstalk on Sunday.There are 34 sitting days, he said, between the return of the Dáil in January and Easter.“It is not tenable that the Dáil will continue on an indefinite week-to-week basis so there has to be certainty and clarity brought to the situation.”Mr Martin said there is “no point in going back on the 15th of January if you don’t have clarity and certainty about that session because you can’t live from week to week. There will be complete uncertainty”.Are the battle lines being drawn?He said if a date is not set, “tactics and manoeuvring will take place over substantive work”.“In the time that is left, it is a tidying up period really if we are honest,” he said.Mr Martin said he wanted to ensure in the remaining time that an extension to the threshold for medical-card eligibility for over 70s is agreed and that legislation on electoral transparency passes. He also said legislation to allow for medical open disclosure must also be passed.Speaking on RTÉ’s The Week in Politics, Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed described Mr Martin’s letter as “bizarre” and said Fianna Fáil can collapse the Government at any time.A Fine Gael source said that Mr Varadkar has already proposed holding an election next summer and that he is unlikely to move from this position.Tánaiste Simon Coveney said Mr Martin was “slow off the mark”.“I am not going to add to more speculation. The Taoiseach made it clear that he is happy to meet Micheál Martin at the end of the Dáil term to talk about these issues, that is effectively at the end of the week.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4116146.1576449735!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north s political heavyweights have been sent a firm message on stormont","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘On Thursday the public told the DUP and Sinn Féin to get on with it. They now have a chance to do just that.’ File photograph: Paul FaithPA It must be difficult after such a long and bruising election campaign, particularly for the like of DUP leader Arlene Foster, for politicians to feel compelled to return to the fray so quickly.But exhausted as they must be all five main parties have pledged to turn up for today’s talks aimed at restoring powersharing. And the public have told them clearly what they want.The parties will join Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith in seeking to resolve difficulties that almost three years on are still blocking Stormont’s return.So, do Smith and Coveney have any chance of success?“We’re listening,” said Foster at the weekend. The chastened DUP has much to heed. Its most experienced politician, and the author of its calamitous Brexit policy, Nigel Dodds, lost his seat in North Belfast while Emma Little Pengelly was defeated in South Belfast. Dodds now must decide on his future. He could be co-opted to Upper Bann as an MLA, but that may be Little Pengelly’s destiny, or he could go to the House of Lords.Questions also remain over Foster’s future as DUP leader. There have been no ostensible challenges so far, but it must be an issue for some senior figures. In a statement Foster made clear she is still up for the joust: “We will be attending the talks on Monday. We will not be found wanting.”That was positive but otherwise much of her short statement was an attack on Sinn Féin and how it had “barred everyone from government”.That probably is fair enough in terms of a holding statement, but if it is more than that then ominously it could indicate that the DUP is not yet quite aware of the new political reality.Taking North Belfast was a big success for Sinn Féin, not only electing John Finucane and ousting Dodds but putting the issue of a Border poll higher up the debating agenda. But equally its vote was down by 6.7 per cent and its politicians and election campaigners heard the message on the doorstep just as loudly as the DUP – the people want Stormont back to tackle life-and-death and bread-and-butter matters.Is restoring powersharing difficult?Mark Carruthers, presenter of BBC Northern Ireland’s Sunday Politics programme, yesterday put it to Sinn Féin’s Alex Maskey that despite the success of North Belfast, the party was “at sixes and sevens” after the election. “We are not at sixes and sevens, we are seven, we have seven MPs,” replied Maskey, referring to the fact that even if the vote was down Sinn Féin still had seven abstentionist MPs. That was a quick-witted rejoinder, but the party also knows, as must the DUP, that if lost votes are to be regained from the surging centre ground then Stormont is the place to be. What the politicians have to do to restore powersharing isn’t really difficult. It requires some form of an Irish language Act, the absence of which still appears to be the key issue. That Act could be wrapped up in some form of all-embracing cultural legislation that would allow Foster and her colleagues save face, though it would also need to be sold by the DUP.On Thursday the public told the DUP and Sinn Féin to get on with it. They now have a chance to do just that.Can Boris Johnson get a majority and finally deliver Brexit?

The Taoiseach said Boris Johnson had a ‘very strong personal mandate. . . It’s up to him to decide how he wants to use it.’ Photograph:  Kenzo TribouillardAFP via Getty ImagesTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said a “bare bones” trade agreement between the EU and the UK may be possible late next year if a full trade agreement cannot be negotiated in time, as most EU leaders expect.EU leaders attending the summit in Brussels acknowledged that the UK would now leave the EU in January, but most do not believe a trade agreement can be agreed before the transition period ends next December – raising the prospect of another “cliff edge” in 12 months’ time.However, speaking to journalists after the conclusion of the summit, Mr Varadkar said it “may be possible to put together some kind of bare bones agreement to cover some aspects of it”.He said this would “not be ‘no deal’ in the sense that we used to talk about no deal” because of the guarantees in the withdrawal agreement.Earlier, Mr Varadkar warned against moves towards a united Ireland in the wake of Northern Ireland result, which saw unionist losses and gains for nationalists and the Alliance Party.Mr Varadkar said while the “tectonic plates” were shifting in the North, the focus should be reviving the powersharing institutions, rather than pushing for a united Ireland.PowersharingHe said there was now “no unionist majority, no nationalist majority and an ever-expanding centre ground”.He added: “The one thing that hasn’t changed for Northern Ireland is that the best future for Northern Ireland is one based on powersharing and one based on reconciliation, one based on bringing all communities together. And the next step in that has to be getting the Executive and Assembly up and running before January 13th.”On Brexit, Mr Varadkar said that he agreed with French president Emmanuel Macron who told the council meeting there should be “no quotas, no tariffs and no dumping” – referring to the need for the UK to uphold European standards of worker protection and product standards if it was to benefit from open access to the European market.“That’s the kind of space we’re in as the European Union,” Mr Varadkar said.Asked “which Boris will turn up” at talks, Mr Varadkar said he had met Mr Johnson on a few occasions and they had spoken a lot on the phone “but I certainly can’t read his mind, nor do I know his mind”. “But if I had to guess, I think he is somebody who is an economic and social liberal. And he’s somebody who is going to want to have a close relationship with the European Union, and will want us to have a trade deal as close and also a future relationship that goes beyond trade into an economic partnership, citizens rights and also a political partnership too. But that all remains to be seen.”He added that Mr Johnson had a “very strong personal mandate . . . It’s up to him to decide how he wants to use it.”‘Absolute caveat’Mr Varadkar said Ireland would be an advocate in Europe for the UK to have a close economic and political relationship with the EU – “but with the absolute caveat that it can never undermine the European Union”.“We’re in a different place and we’re in a more vulnerable place in a lot of ways, so we need to maintain our place at the centre of the European Union – but also we need to maintain a close relationship with our nearest neighbour. So that’s going to be a challenge, but I think it’s one we can navigate,” he said. Mr Varadkar said EU leaders in their private discussions had stressed the importance of maintaining unity among the EU member states behind chef negotiator Michel Barnier’s task force.The Taoiseach said that would be difficult because the interests of EU countries would erge in the trade talks. “So we need to stick together and we need to maintain solidarity and unity, and that’s what we intend to do.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"US diplomat says it will not accept deadline set by PyongyangPeter Goff reports from Kashgar, Xinjiang: \u0026lsquoAll the students have graduated ... our work is done here,\u0026rsquo says principal at Uighur \u0026lsquore-education camp\u0026rsquoActivists say path to citizenship protects Hindus and Christians but not MuslimsFire outside Dhaka is second such blaze in less than a weekGroups of masked protesters marched through malls chanting slogans \u0026lsquoreturn justice to us\u0026rsquoWhakatane, a picturesque town on shore of Bay of Plenty is main access point to island16th victim died in Australia where number of survivors suffering severe burns are being treatedKrystal Browitt (21) was on White Island with her father and sister when eruption occurredAnnouncement comes as North continues to pressure Trump in bid to salvage nuclear talksPopes have been trying to get to China since 1177.

Photograph: Gilles SabriéNew York TimesAt least two major re-education camps in Kashgar in the Xinjiang region have been shut down in recent weeks, The  can confirm, but observers say while the government strategies in the region are changing, hundreds of thousands of members of ethnic minorities are still being held against their will in some form.In the face of increasing international condemnation, the Xinjiang government announced last week the camps would be closing as “all the students had graduated”.Last month, the China Cables – leaked Chinese Communist Party documents given to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared with The  – helped detail how the prison-like, extrajudicial facilities were part of a mass campaign of oppression against ethno-religious minorities.Over the weekend, The  visited two shuttered Kashgar camps that until very recently had housed hundreds, if not thousands, of detainees.At the Kashgar City Vocational Skills Training Centre, the high fences and watch towers remained, but the large iron gates were wide open, the security and armed police detail had disappeared, and the expansive campus was desolate.“All the students have graduated. They are all finished now. Our work is done here,” said principal Mijiti Maihemoti, who ran the camp for two years.After initially denying the re-education camps existed, in the face of mounting evidence Beijing admitted last year it had established “vocational training centres” across the province to help deradicalise minorities and counter extremism, as well as to teach the detainees Mandarin, the national laws and vocational skills.“They have all been deradicalised and completed their studies. Nobody in this area is in further need of the training,” Mr Maihemoti said as he walked through the buildings that had all been stripped bare.All the signage, chairs, desks, tables, whiteboards, bunk beds, office and kitchen equipment, surveillance cameras – everything had been ripped out, leaving virtually nothing behind in the camp but empty, concrete rooms.Prison alternativeThe principal said more than 1,000 students had been through the facility over the past two years. His 70 teachers and the remaining students had all left at the end of November, he said.The government would still offer vocational training in some centres, “but only if they are willing to come. They will not be forced to come,” he said.While the stated policy was that people attended the camps voluntarily, at a local level officials more often depicted them as detention centres for minor offenders or people of concern who might otherwise face the harsh and opaque prison system.Human rights groups and academics said there have been indications in recent months that the government was starting to wind down the camp system, while at the same time ramping up other forms of oppression. Dr Darren Byler, a specialist in Uighur and other minority issues in Xinjiang, said he felt the recent media reports had put pressure on the government to say they were dismantling the camps.“My sense is that the leaks have prompted these statements from the government as well as intensifications of other forms of denial and misinformation,” he said.If there have been mass graduations across the province, it will not have resulted in a substantial change for most people who were in the camps, said Dr Byler, a lecturer at the University of Washington.“They are still being held against their will, as before,” he said. “Those who are transferred to factories are also still under strong forms of coercion based on all verifiable evidence I have seen. Many others have been transferred to prisons.”Government reports indicate that, in addition to those detained in the camps, hundreds of thousands have been sent to prison in Xinjiang over the past three years, with the conviction rate in parts of the province up to 20 times the national average.Surveillance and indoctrinationThe documents show the long-term provincial strategy is to place most of the Muslim minority population in selected factory jobs, where surveillance and indoctrination can continue. Refusing government-assigned jobs without sufficient reason is one of the 75 signs of extremism listed by officials, and “there must not be any resistance”.One Uighur who now lives outside China said he was not heartened by the reports the camps were closing as many people were still missing from his village.“If they have graduated and it is over now, then where are all the missing people? We should hear from them. So many people I know are still missing family and friends,” he said. “We don’t know if they are in camps or factories or where.”Outside of Kashgar, the Shule County Vocational Training Centre was also empty when The  visited on Saturday. On a previous visit in July, there were hundreds in the facility and the director Mamat Eli had said he expected some of them to stay for at least two or three years.Many were “infected with radical thoughts”, he said then, and it could take years to treat and train them.Now it stands in silence. The Chinese flag in the courtyard has been taken down along with the centre’s name and the propaganda signs. The buildings – some of which were only completed in the past year or so – were all under lock and key. In the icy cold, an elderly woman swept leaves on the cement expanse where until recently hundreds performed daily, choreographed exercise drills.A county official denied there was an abrupt change in policy with the decision to close the camps.1,000 facilities“They all graduated, I think. There is no need for them anymore,” Mr Li, a Shule official, said. “But the government might reopen some later and people can come voluntarily if ordinary people want to learn some skills in future.”The government has never said how many camps were opened, or how many people have been put through them, only saying the situation was “dynamic and fluid”. Some estimates have suggested there could be 1,000 or more of the facilities scattered across the massive 1.2 million sqkm province, which borders eight countries.German researcher Adrian Zenz estimates anything up to 1.8 million Uighurs and other ethnic minorities could have been sent to the camps over the past three years.There is currently no independent verification of the government’s claims.During the visit to the region, government officials produced several former detainees from the local camps who, under official watch, all told The  strikingly similar stories. They had been infected with radical extremist thoughts, they all said they were rehabilitated in the camps they now were out and had jobs thanks to the government and their lives were all much improved so they were eternally grateful to the party.“I was slowly educated. So was everyone else. There is no problem now,” said one 32-year-old waiter. “We have all graduated. We are free.”"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.General election 2019: Labour claims the BBC \u0026#39consciously\u0026#39 helped Boris Johnson win general election - latest newsComment: With a stonking mandate, the Tories must seize this chance to make the case for conservatismNew Zealand PM warns of year-long inquiry as country marks one week since deadly volcano eruptionFootball for sale: Agent and manager found guilty of briberyComment: Surely it’s time for pollsters to hang up their clipboards?  Join the  for an exclusive subscriber post-election phone-inWhat next after the election?

After crashing back down to $175, it then went on another positive run in 2017 that took it close to $20,000 by the end of that year.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince then, bitcoin has tumbled once more, reaching below $4,000 at the start of 2019 before recovering to today’s price of around $7,000.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearIn a six-part blog published from letters he wrote in\u0026nbspprison, Ulbricht\u0026nbspapplied a form of market analysis known as Elliott Wave Theory to predict new all-time highs for bitcoin.The theory forecasts the highs and lows in financial market cycles by identifying extremes in investor psychology, which in the case of bitcoin appear to be far more tempormental compared to traditional markets due to the nacency of the cryptocurrency.The principle posits that price movements in speculative markets are driven by investor expectation, which when combined with mass psychology can force prices artificially higher through a positive feedback loop of buyer optimism.Looking at the previous price waves of bitcoin, Ulbricht puts the next big wave reaching between $93,000 and $109,000 before the 17 February, 2021. He notes that his speculation should be considered with appropriate scepticism.“We have a price target... of ~$100,000 some time in or near 2020,” he wrote. “However, there is no rule that market moves have to be proportional. This is just a patter we see unfolding that may or may not continue.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The pub chain owner and prominent Brexit supporter saw the value of his stake in the pub chain jump almost 10 per cent from £487m to £531m.Mr Martin had backed the Brexit Party, which failed to secure a single seat, but he will likely be pleased with the result in any case after a Tory landslide prompted Wetherspoon shares to rise from\u0026nbsp1,482p to 1,619p.Boris Johnson’s decisive win boosted the pound and sent shares in a number of UK companies soaring\u0026nbspon the hopes that uncertainty around Brexit will now fade away.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Martin has been one of the few business leaders to vocally back leaving the EU. He spent £94,856 on pro-Brexit beer mats and\u0026nbsphas regularly used the pub group’s magazine to promote the benefits of leaving.The company’s updates to the stock market have also been used as a platform to rail at EU rules and bureaucracy.Created with Sketch.General election 2019: How the night unfolded Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.227 11.28pm - First result to be announcedLabour holds Newcastle Central, albeit with a reduced majority, in the first result to be announced in the 2019 General ElectionThe Conservatives gain Blyth Valley, in the North East, from Labour in the first big upset of the night.

Wetherspoon\u0026nbsphas doubled in value since then,\u0026nbspadding more than £250m\u0026nbspto Mr Martin’s personal wealth.Earlier this week, Wetherspoon\u0026nbspalso announced plans to invest more than £200m in pubs and hotels over the next four years, creating around 10,000 jobs.New pubs and hotels will be opened, and existing pubs across the UK and Republic of Ireland will be enlarged.Most of the investment will be channelled into developments in small and medium-sized towns, but will also include larger towns and cities.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past.

Nobody in the band thinks that’s worth a second’s thought.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMacGowan\u0026nbsphas already defended the track’s use of the word “f****t”, writing in a statement in 2017, “The word was used by the character because it fitted with the way she would speak and with her character.Created with Sketch.The 50 best albums of the decade – 2010 to 2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars.

On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard.

(PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer.

Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. “She is not supposed to be a nice person, or even a wholesome person. She is a woman of a certain generation at a certain time in history and she is down on her luck and desperate.”Earlier this year, a\u0026nbspBBC radio presenter\u0026nbspbanned the song from his show after calling it an “offensive pile of downmarket chav bilge”.BBC Radio Solent’s Alex Dyke tweeted that he wasn’t comfortable with the song’s lyrics.\u0026nbspThe tweet, which has since been deleted, said: “Radio, let’s ban ‘Fairytale of New York’ this Christmas! ‘You’re a sl*t on junk, you scumbag, cheap lousy f****t’ – is this what we want our kids singing in the back of the car?”The story behind The Pogues’ ‘Fairytale of New York’He continued: “It’s an offensive pile of downmarket chav bilge. We can do better!”On his radio show, Dyke further explained to his listeners that he would not be playing the track this festive season. “I hope I’m not going to ruin your Christmas,” he said, “but I’ve decided that I am no longer comfortable with playing ‘Fairytale of New York’ by The Pogues and Kirsty MacColl.”“I think Christmas songs should be about excited children, toys, Christmas trees, snowy streets, ski lodges, reindeer, wrapping paper, Santa, family, peace on earth and love,” the DJ added. “I just find The Pogues’ ‘Fairytale of New York’ a nasty, nasty song.”“Fairytale of New York” is a source of annual consternation due to its lyrics, with some radio stations censoring the track to prevent possible offence.“Fairytale of New York” reached number two in the UK Top 40 on its release in 1987, and continues to be one of the UK’s most popular Christmas songs. In 2018, it resurfaced to reach number four in the charts.In a statement, a BBC spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“This was Alex’s decision. There is no ban.

Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder. Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral.

The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument.

Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. This is Frusciante’s third stint with Red Hot Chili Peppers. The guitarist originally joined the group as a replacement to original band member, Hillel Slovak, following his death in 1988.Frusciante featured on the band’s critically acclaimed and commercially successful 1991 album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, the success of which caused him to leave the group due to worries over his mental health.Frusciante returned to the band six years later,\u0026nbspplaying\u0026nbspon their Californication album in 1999 and 2002’s By the Way, before leaving again during the band’s extended hiatus in 2009.\u0026nbspRed Hot Chili Peppers are set to headline multiple European festivals in 2020. The group will be performing at Ejekt Festival in Athens, Greece, on 5 June, Firenze Rocks in Florence, Italy, on 13 June and Pinkpop Festival in Landgraff, Netherlands, on 19 June.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It predicts that this proportion could rise to between 12 and 20 per cent over the next decade as younger people join the workforce.The 29-page guide advises staff to cut out unnecessary gendered language and provides advice on how to ask someone which pronouns they prefer when describing\u0026nbspthemselves.It suggests providing all-gender facilities, promoting visible trans and non-binary role models and ensuring forms do not only include options for two genders.“It is much simpler to refer to someone as Hilary, than ‘she’ or ‘he’, and this can avoid worries over mis-gendering,” the guide states.Managers are advised to demonstrate their commitment to inclusion by personally taking action such as adding their pronouns to their email signatures.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I said that I identified as non-binary and told people that I was saying it for the first time and everyone applauded, which was heart-warming. Then nothing really happened, apart from a few people, who said ‘well done’. It was all very low-key and remains so.”In the foreword, Mr McKenna-Coles wrote that Lloyd’s has “room for further development” on trans and non-binary inclusion.“One of the secondary threads of our research was confusion and lack of knowledge on behalf of managers and colleagues over how to handle the situation, and, with the best intentions in the world, how to make it all ‘work right’ for all parties,” he wrote.City employers are taking note of the fact that increasing ersity and inclusion is good policy and good for business.Firms in the top quartile for ersity were 21 per cent more likely to have above-average profitability than those in the bottom quartile, a study by\u0026nbspMcKinsey\u0026nbspfound last year.Lloyds of London\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For a bit. Lucky you.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Resign, you disingenuous plopcarpet.”Created with Sketch.The 30 best TV shows of the decade Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright.

We were told that that referendum would settle the question for a generation. In this general election, we have just seen what happens when politicians try to overturn a referendum result.“In the same way, we should respect the referendum result of 2014. Scotland is stronger in the United Kingdom. You can be proudly Scottish and proudly British together.“The best of this country – the NHS, the BBC – these are British institutions and therefore we should be proud of what we have achieved together and confirmed that the United Kingdom is a strong partnership that works for all.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailMs Sturgeon said: “The risk for the Conservatives here – though I should be quite relaxed about it – is that the more they block the will of the Scottish people, the\u0026nbspmore contempt they show for Scottish democracy, the more they will increase support for Scottish independence.“In a sense they are doing my job for me. The momentum and the mandate is on the side of those us who believe Scotland should be independent but it’s also on the side of those who might not be decided on independence but agree with that principle that it’s for the people of Scotland to make that decision.”Ms Sturgeon said she gave this message to Mr Johnson in their phone call on Friday. “I said this to him on Friday night on the telephone – if he thinks saying no is the end of the matter then he is going to find himself completely and utterly wrong.”Asked when Ms Sturgeon would formally inform the prime minister of her desire to hold a referendum, Mr Blackford told Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “This week.”Mr Blackford declined to say which day the request would be submitted, telling Ridge: “You’ll see. We are not going to be announcing it publicly today but it will be happening\u0026nbspthis week, but you’ll see we will be making the case that that power should be transferred. That’s democracy. We’ve won the election. Boris Johnson can’t ignore it.“He’s going to recognise that the SNP are speaking for the people of Scotland. We won this election, we’ve 45 per cent of the vote, 80 per cent of the seats. This issue is not going to go away. We will win that right to have a referendum on Scottish independence. This will happen and he should accept the reality of that sooner rather than later.”Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat interim leader Ed Davey\u0026nbspwas highly critical of Ms Sturgeon’s exuberant on-screen celebration of the defeat of party leader Jo Swinson in East Dunbartonshire, when she was filmed punching the air in delight.“She’s not very dignified, is she?” Sir Ed told Ridge. “I think that approach to politics – taking glee in someone else’s defeat in the way she does, a very personal way – isn’t appropriate for the first minister of Scotland.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The pub chain owner and prominent Brexit supporter saw the value of his stake in the pub chain jump almost 10 per cent from £487m to £531m.Mr Martin had backed the Brexit Party, which failed to secure a single seat, but he will likely be pleased with the result in any case after a Tory landslide prompted Wetherspoon shares to rise from\u0026nbsp1,482p to 1,619p.Boris Johnson’s decisive win boosted the pound and sent shares in a number of UK companies soaring\u0026nbspon the hopes that uncertainty around Brexit will now fade away.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Martin has been one of the few business leaders to vocally back leaving the EU. He spent £94,856 on pro-Brexit beer mats and\u0026nbsphas regularly used the pub group’s magazine to promote the benefits of leaving.The company’s updates to the stock market have also been used as a platform to rail at EU rules and bureaucracy.Created with Sketch.General election 2019: How the night unfolded Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.227 11.28pm - First result to be announcedLabour holds Newcastle Central, albeit with a reduced majority, in the first result to be announced in the 2019 General ElectionThe Conservatives gain Blyth Valley, in the North East, from Labour in the first big upset of the night.

Wetherspoon\u0026nbsphas doubled in value since then,\u0026nbspadding more than £250m\u0026nbspto Mr Martin’s personal wealth.Earlier this week, Wetherspoon\u0026nbspalso announced plans to invest more than £200m in pubs and hotels over the next four years, creating around 10,000 jobs.New pubs and hotels will be opened, and existing pubs across the UK and Republic of Ireland will be enlarged.Most of the investment will be channelled into developments in small and medium-sized towns, but will also include larger towns and cities.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school.

Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.Today poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education and no better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania.

No better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania, where a 12-year-old boy, out of school, forced\u0026nbspinto a life of work, trapped in a dead-end cycle of danger and despair so he can provide for his family, provides perspective. He says: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my brothers and sisters. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.”Chacha works 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, under the cover of darkness to avoid detection, on one of the many small-scale gold mining sites in the northwest of the country. Illegally, he scavenges the mines for residue-bearing rock which he digs up and sells to middle-men who crush and extract the gold. Chacha’s cut of £1.50 a day is used to contribute to household bills. The work is exhausting and dangerous. Trespassers are shot on sight – even children.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTanzania\u0026nbsphas strong laws governing child labour,\u0026nbspreinforced by the national action plan to eliminate the practice. The plan prohibits under-18s from engaging in hazardous work, including mining, but children are still lured into mines with the hope of changing their fortunes and those of their families.Chacha has never set foot in a classroom, perhaps he never will. He is one of the estimated 1.895 million children out-of-school children\u0026nbspin Tanzania today.New hope for Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge’s brutal war on educationHis only possible salvation may come through partnerships such as those between the Education Above All\u0026nbspFoundation (EAA) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT). These collaborations place a strong emphasis on capacity building – boosting schools in all areas to help them run efficiently and sustainably – as well as community engagement and service support. The EAA-GMT partnership has successfully enrolled 23,479 out-of-school children\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspquality primary education over\u0026nbsptwo years in the Mara region – comprising the most challenging and hardest to reach districts of Tanzania.GMT brought in the Complementary Basic Education in Tanzania (COBET) accelerated learning programme, to give a second chance to over-age learners who had never been to school – and to those who had dropped out.In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme\u0026nbspand eliminated public school fees\u0026nbspto increase access to primary education. But\u0026nbspmany challenges have arisen. Schooling is now mandatory for children aged seven to 15, and although enrolment has dramatically increased, Tanzania has not yet achieved universal primary education. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary\u0026nbspparental contributions required for enrolment. This includes, among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes.All children should be able to attend primary school regardless of whether their parents can or can’t afford to pay or see the value, perhaps never having received\u0026nbspan education themselves. At its core, if a child fails to gain the basic skills required to contribute as a functioning member of\u0026nbspsociety, the loss is vast, not just to the child or society but the nation as a whole. For those sceptical, education can ultimately reduce poverty for future generations. Studies show the cost of educating children is far outweighed by the cost of not educating them.Their schools lie in ruins – but is there hope for Mosul’s children?Women of Gaza: Empowered and resilientThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolSheikha Moza bint Nasser, chair\u0026nbspand founder of EAA, has dedicated much of her life to ensuring the most marginalised children can go to school, when there was no duty or expectation for her to do so. At\u0026nbspUnesco’s headquarters in Paris last year, she said: “Statistics cannot catalogue the impact of\u0026nbspchildren’s broken dreams. So we must not allow ourselves to be ‘numbed’\u0026nbspby the numbers, and we cannot accept apathy as a response. Because history, as we know, will judge us, by both what we do, and what we choose not to do.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our god was Lenin,” says Sheikh Nuri Shekhnamati, a priest at the Quba Sultan Ezid, a Yazidi temple in the capital Tbilisi.“People were more humane. With today’s wild capitalism we struggle to live day by day. The time came for religion. Religion can help. Everyone needs some kind of spirituality,” he adds.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe temple sits on top of a hill in the outskirts of Tbilisi, surrounded by crowded Soviet-era housing blocks on one side, and a ghostly new Chinese-built mall, the biggest one in the Caucasus, on the other. It was a typically quiet day at the temple, and Shekhnamati made us tea and offered us sweets as we sat with him in the kitchen.Yazidis are a Kurdish-speaking religious minority from northern Iraq. While most of the population lives in Iraq today, there were two waves of migration to the Caucasus in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Some Yazidis identify as ethnic Kurds, others as ethnic Yazidis, and this debate can be isive.Yazidi temple in the world outside of IraqThe monotheistic religion has no holy book, and its sacred texts are orally transmitted by members of their priestly castes, such as Shekhnamati, who was born into a family of priests known as sheikhs. Yazidi priests do not formally teach the religion to their followers and many sacred texts are hidden from non-Yazidis. Until recently, no temples were built outside of the Yazidi heartland in Iraq.In the Caucasus, the modernising drive of the Soviet Union caused many members of the priesthood to lose this orally transmitted knowledge.\u0026nbsp“I started learning the texts later in life, in my mid-20s. I was more interested in my professional career, but people kept asking me to learn the religion,” he recalls. “I had no right to refuse: I was the son of a sheikh.”\u0026nbspInstead, he studied electrical mechanics for trains and subway systems, and in his last job before joining the temple, he fixed street lamps. He lives with his wife, son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren, in a flat in an old housing blocks not far from the temple.Social upheavals and political transitions took their toll on the survival of the Yazidi religion in Georgia. “Our community was dying out,” says Dimitri Pirbari, the temple’s spiritual leader. But mobilising a community with no book, no institutions and no centralised structure proved the biggest challenge.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAt the time of its launch in 2015, the Quba Sultan Ezid was the second Yazidi temple in the world outside of Iraq. With its single spire and bare-walled interiors, it is modelled on the mausoleum of Lalish, the main Yazidi pilgrimage site in northern Iraq.On the other side of the grounds, a pyramid-shaped glass building serves as a centre for Georgian and Kurdish language lessons, and a recently launched course teaching the Yazidi religion and its history to any member of the public. Hanging on the centre’s walls are archival photographs, including an image of Tbilisi’s Yazidi community at a march commemorating the anniversary of the October Revolution in 1938. \u0026nbspThe process of assimilation is really evident in our community. We’re losing our language and our religion. We don’t have a homelandIt was the response from a community that had come dangerously close to losing its presence in Georgian society.\u0026nbsp“The process of assimilation is really evident in our community. We’re losing our language and our religion. We don’t have a homeland,” says Lili Safarova, a Tbilisi-based women’s and education activist who was involved in the initial stages of the temple’s creation. “We needed a space to continue our language and our traditions.”At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Yazidi community of Georgia numbered around 33,000. The rise of Georgian nationalism and ongoing civil war in the 1990s caused waves of migration to Russian cities and later to Europe. By 2002, the number of Yazidis living in Georgia had halved to around 18,000. In 2014, fewer than 12,000 remained.\u0026nbspIn religiously conservative Georgia, where the Orthodox Church’s influence plays a powerful political role, the creation of a dedicated space for the Yazidi community in Tbilisi took more than two decades from conception to reality.The idea of a temple and cultural centre was floated as early as the 1990s. The land was then acquired from the government in 2007, and permission to build a temple was granted by Patriarch Ilya II in 2010. The Yazidi religion was officially recognised as a public entity in Georgia in 2011.Political reforms after Georgia’s Rose Revolution of 2003 facilitated the process. Georgia is home to many minorities and religions, and Tbilisi has historically been a erse and cosmopolitan hub city.\u0026nbspBut after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and until 2005, no religion other than the Georgian Orthodox Church could be officially registered. Amendments to the civil code in 2011 allowed minority religions to register as public entities.\u0026nbsp“We advocated the issue because it gave legal status to all our organisations. We did not have this possibility before,” says Agit Mirzoev, a Tbilisi-based public defence lawyer who is involved in the temple and spiritual council’s registration.The Soviet Union suppressed religion, but it supported the Kurdish culture and folklore of Tbilisi’s Kurdish-speaking community, who were predominantly Yazidis. In Tbilisi, a Kurdish theatre run by the community held regular performances, but it stopped operating in the early 1990s, after Georgia’s independence. \u0026nbsp“I can count on my fingers the number of Georgian\u0026nbspYazidis\u0026nbspwho’ve come out of poverty. Many do not pursue a higher education“The theatre was a source of pride for us at the time. For the children of a generation that was predominantly illiterate, to be writing records of our culture and history...” recalled Vitali Nabiev, a Yazidi journalist from Tbilisi who now lives in France.\u0026nbspWith the absence of a dedicated space, Kurdish nationalist groups from the Middle East filled the vacuum. The Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK) had an office in Tbilisi and was active in the 1990s, transmitting extremist literature, recruiting fighters and facilitating travel to Turkey through Moscow. Leaders of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq also supported cultural activities such as radio stations and newspapers, and made donations to the existing temple.Today, while inter-ethnic tensions have softened in Georgia since the 1990s, economic and social issues remain for the Yazidi community.\u0026nbsp“I can count on my fingers the number of Georgian Yazidis who’ve come out of poverty. Many do not pursue a higher education. Until recently, many did not have faith in the electoral system and did not participate in elections,” says Isko Daseny, a Georgian parliamentarian and member of the Yazidi community.But the biggest threat for the community is the loss of identity.\u0026nbspSince its opening, the activity at the temple has trickled slowly into the lives of Yazidis in Tbilisi. “I come here three to four times a month with my family,” says Rafael Adjamyan, a young resident of Tbilisi. “When I was growing up we could only dream of a space like this. There are a lot of rumours about our religion. We needed a space to get accurate and reliable information.”\u0026nbspBut overall visitor figures are unclear. “It’s difficult to say how many people come,” says Shekhnamati, “On a busy day, we get up to 100 people. But yesterday nobody came, and the day before that 20 visitors.” Of the approximately 1,000 Yazidis he estimates live in the vicinity, only some 300 visit the temple.Rather, the traditions of Yazidis in the Caucasus are centred around the community’s homes and cemeteries. The religion’s strict caste system assigns the role of religious teachings to pirs, which means elder in Kurdish, or sheikhs. Every Yazidi has their own pir and sheikh, including the pirs and sheikhs themselves. Yazidis visited leaders from the priestly castes of pirs and sheikhs for weddings, funerals and other holy days. \u0026nbsp“For spiritual matters, I go to my pir,” says Emma Kalashov, a retired cleaner living in one of the vast housing units of Varkatili, a neighbourhood near the temple – “My pir is my temple.” Her visits to the physical temple, she adds, are limited. “I may go four times a year, when my family visits from abroad.”Emma’s pir, Edik Pir Drbes, lives in her building. On the door to his flat is a small sticker of Lalish’s conical spires, and large peacock-shaped ornaments line the walls and shelves of his living room.\u0026nbspAnd though Yazidis do not have a book, Pir Drbes has a large peacock-emblazoned book-shaped case high on a plinth against the back wall.I was 10 years old. My father died young so my brother taught me what he had learnt from our grandfather. I visited families with him and learnt that wayPir Drbes describes the mysticism at the heart of the religion and its language. “Nobody can see God Himself. I associate God with the sun, and I pray facing the sun,” he explains.\u0026nbspIn addition, Yazidis believe in seven holy beings, headed by an archangel, Tawus Melak, who takes the form of a peacock. “Melak tawus is an angel coming from God – he has power and reigns on everything on earth,” says Pir Drbes. “After God the most respected persons in our culture are our parents.”“No religious event can happen without the presence of a pir or sheikh,” explains Pir Drbes. “We are there for weddings and funerals to recite prayers. With our own hands, we sew white clothes for the dead before they are buried.”\u0026nbspPir Drbes was initiated to the religion’s sacred oral traditions from a young age. “I was 10 years old. My father died young so my brother taught me what he had learnt from our grandfather. I visited families with him and learnt that way.”In his bedroom, he shows us his ster, a shrine consisting of stacked mattresses, which is found in Yazidi households in the Caucasus. Academics believe this tradition emerged out of the originally nomadic nature of Caucasian Yazidis.\u0026nbsp“When we were cut off from Iraq we created these domestic altars in our homes. When the sun is not visible, I open this shrine and pray to it,” he explains.\u0026nbspHe pulls out a plastic bag from within the mattress heap, which contains soil, cotton string and pearl-shaped clay balls gathered from his recent trips to Iraq. \u0026nbspPirs and sheikhs typically receive alms from their followers. But grinding poverty in the Caucasus caused many to turn away from spiritual matters. “The church charges very high fees for its services, but as Yazidi priests, we take whatever our followers can give us,” says Pir Drbes. \u0026nbspAs he drove us through the sprawl of housing blocks to the local cemetery in his 4x4 German car with leather seats, with the letters “P – IR” on his license plate, Pir Drbes explained that he does not have a job other than his spiritual role. “I prefer to serve the people.”\u0026nbspBy contrast to the informal, unwritten traditions described by Pir Drbes, the leaders at the temple pursue an active spiritual, educational and political strategy. “Our first aim is to be recognised as an institutionalised religion. Without this it’s difficult to dialogue with other religions,” explains Pirbari.The Yazidi religion has no institutional hierarchy. There is one political leader, the Mir, and important religious figures who form a spiritual council in Iraq. But when the Yazidi Spiritual Council of Georgia was registered in 2011, it appointed its own spiritual leader.\u0026nbspPirbari dresses in white cotton robes and headband, typical of a priest in rural Iraq. Greeting us in the reception room, he recalls his nostalgia for Dighomi, the neighbourhood which he grew up in Tbilisi. Like much of the city, it has been affected by ongoing uncontrolled construction. On the wall behind him is a painting of the mausoleum at Lalish, and on the adjacent wall hangs a northern Iraqi rug.\u0026nbspMy studies in ethnology show\u0026nbspYazidism\u0026nbspis an ethnicity and a religion. We are not Kurds. We have the right to self-identify“I want the spiritual content of the Yazidi religion to inform the daily lives of Yazidis,” explains Pirbari.\u0026nbspAs such, the temple has revived rituals which did not previously exist among Yazidis in the Caucasus. Pirbari has strong connections to the spiritual leadership in Iraq, and In June this year, the temple brought in qewwals, members of the Yazidi spiritual castes whose role is to sing sacred texts, and who only live in Lalish, Iraq. “There was a lot of admiration for them,” says Pirbari, “It is one of the ways in which we are trying to recover our traditions.”Some view the temple in Tbilisi as a contemporary expression of the religion. “They’re trying to create a ‘modern’ form of Yazidism that could be seen as more ‘systematic’ and understandable to the younger generation,” says Khanna Omarkhali, an Associate Professor at the Free University of Berlin and a member of the Yazidi priesthood.The temple extols the view that Yazidis are a distinct ethnic group. “My studies in ethnology show Yazidism is an ethnicity and a religion. We are not Kurds. We have the right to self-identify,” insists Pirbari.\u0026nbspThis is partly in response to the fact that, for decades, the Yazidi community has been caught between different parties of the Kurdish struggle in the Middle East. “We don’t want to be part of these political games,” says Mirzoev. “We have peaceful aims as citizens of Georgia.”The educational centre, named the “Theology Academy”, teaches religion, language and history, and is the first of its kind in the world. A Department of Yazidism, headed by Pirbari, will soon be created at the Tbilisi’s Ilya State University’s Institute of Oriental Studies.\u0026nbspBut given the oral nature of the religion, this educational dimension is also met with scepticism.“Yazidi priests do not learn their religion in schools. We inherit the knowledge from our parents and grandparents,” says Reza Muradyan, a young priest and shop owner from Tbilisi. “We can’t talk – at least until now – about an explicit theology among Yazidis, first of all because they do not have a sacred writ,” adds Omarkhali.The spiritual council also acts as a political engine. “We are more mobilised and self-organised than ever. We have good communications with the government and with other religions in Georgia, especially the Georgian Orthodox Church,” adds Mirzoev.\u0026nbsp“We want to be part of a process which facilitates peaceful relationships between different world religions,” says Pirbari.\u0026nbsp“We openly declare humane values of mutual respect and love.” Pirbari has facilitated meetings for the Yazidi spiritual leadership in Iraq with the Vatican and Russian patriarchate, among others. Above his desk in his office\u0026nbspis a gold-plated, peacock-shaped relief sculpture which was a gift from the Iranian cleric Ayatollah Shahrestani. \u0026nbspBut the temple’s emphasis on the religious aspects of the Yazidi culture has attracted criticism from some quarters. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn downtown Tbilisi’s House of Friendship, a Soviet-era administrative building with an elaborate modernist facade, Safarova, the women’s activist, describes her concerns: “Today the space is run by a small number of religious persons who have alienated the young in particular.”Many members of the community are not recognised by the temple, including Georgian\u0026nbspYazidis\u0026nbspfrom mixed marriages“The original idea was to have a public cultural centre and a small temple. The young would come to the cultural centre, join its educational activities, and also learn about their religion.” he says, when we met him in his office in the northern suburbs of the capital.Partly, the view that Yazidis are an ethno-religion has been isive. “Our critics are an old guard red star intelligentsia, most of them atheists,” says Pirbari, referring to the fact that the Soviet Union supported Kurdish culture and banned religion. Nonetheless, respondents interviewed for this article of all ages identified as ethnic Yazidis, Kurds or Yazidi-Kurds.Further, many members of the community are not recognised by the temple, including Georgian Yazidis from mixed marriages. “We welcome everyone, from every religion at our temple,” says Pirbari. “But according to our religion, we cannot recognise Yazidis that come from mixed marriages as Yazidis. We will welcome them as members of another religion.”\u0026nbsp“We are fighting for survival, not radicalism,” insists Pirbari. But others disagreed. “We wanted a space that would unite us,” says Safarova, “but now we are ided.”Read the first part in the series, here:\u0026nbspEmerging from Isis genocide, Yazidis in Armenia open religion’s biggest ever templeShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He made sure lines of communication were kept open and regularly hopped on his motorbike and visited his grandparents and other members of his extended family.I suspect that being caught up in this nightmare, which has seen them appear on network TV both here and in the US, as well as an utterly surreal meeting with Donald Trump at the White House, has made it almost impossible for Harry’s parents to grieve properly for their son.They are still in shock, dazed and barely sleeping, and it is only their resolve to achieve justice for their son that is driving them on. Harry’s death made global headlines.Sadly, the spotlight shts all too quickly, and the world forgets about such tragedies and moves on. But Charlotte, Tim and Niall, and everyone who knew and loved Harry, lives with the pain every single minute of every single day.Charlotte told me that Niall, always the quieter and less out-going twin, is finding it extremely hard to come to terms with the death of his brother.He cannot bear to talk about what happened and is haunted because he doesn’t know exactly how Harry died.Tim has spoken about seeing his son’s poor shattered bloody body at the crash scene and how he tried to reassure him that all would be well, but his boy died shortly afterwards.Frankly, I don’t know how Anne Sacoolas can live with herself.If she had only stayed to help the police piece together what had happened, she would have had the chance to express her sorrow, and more than likely been given a suspended sentence.That would at least have given Harry’s family some peace of mind.Instead, Charlotte and Tim are trying to get US officials to listen to them and hoping Donald Trump will make good on his promise of getting something done.If the President thought he could steamroller this “ordinary” British couple during that encounter, he was soon put right.They turned down his clumsy attempt at setting up a meeting with Sacoolas, who was waiting in a White House side room. They didn’t want to be bounced into a Trump photo opportunity, and they also said they rejected an offer of compensation.Charlotte and Tim are also ready to file a civil lawsuit against Sacoolas in the state of Virginia, in an attempt to have her hand herself in to UK authorities.I spoke to them about how the family would face Christmas, and they simply shook their heads in sorrow. Fighting tears, Charlotte told me it was going to be horrendous, especially as Harry loved this time of year so much.I can’t get out of my head the image of them at home, surrounded by sadness, while neighbours in houses around them are making merry.Charlotte said it was made worse by the fact that Sacoolas will be able to celebrate Christmas with her children.It seems the Sacoolas family and the authorities are hoping thatthey stall long enough Charlotte and Tim are just going to go away.I can assure them that they will never give up.I sincerely hope this courageous couple, who are going through the torments of hell, somehow manage to shame officials here and in the US into doing what’s right.Sacoolas should be sent back to the UK to explain herself, apologise and face her punishment.New PM Boris Johnson has a bloody long to-do list, but justice for Harry must be one of his priorities.WILL he fall at the final hurdle Saturday night or will Anton du Beke go all the way and win his first ever Strictly Glitterball after  years of trying.If I was ever to do the showthen you can bet your le it would be poor old Anton who would have to shove me around the dancefloor like an overstuffed wardrobe.He tends to get the plucky no-hopers of a certain age, but this year was given a real contender in the shape of firecracker Emma Barton, from EastEnders.It’s too close to call with the other two finalists, Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden, and Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse at the top of their game, but no one would begrudge Anton his moment of glory.JENNIFER Lopez celebrated her Screen Actors Guild Award nomination with an online message to her fans – while on a treadmill in the gym.Being J-Lo, her make-up was flawless, she was wearing a gorgeous tracksuit and she completed the look with fabulous hoop earrings.Despite working out, she wasn’t even glowing, never mind perspiring.What a contrast to the rest of us.I’m a sweaty, red-faced mess after my exercise class and look as though I’ve been dragged through every hedge in the land not just backwards, but forwards too.J-Lo has been nominated for a SAG for her role as Ramona in Hustlers, and during the message she even got a little teary, but of course without the red nose and puffy eyes of us mere mortals.She makes the world a more beautul place.She’s the powerhouse behind the insane Kardashian phenomenon and expert at making very little talent go a bloody long way. Now we are told that the scariest stepmother since Cinderella’s has decided to buy her long-suffering family, including her -year-old mum, Botox vouchers for Christmas.Obviously there’s a money-making opportunity here, as Kris has signed up to promote a Botox company offering  gt tokens as seasonal presents.And I suppose eventhey are insulted or unhappy about her gt, they won’t be able to show those emotions on their newly frozen faces.So Kris wins again.I’M deeply concerned and extremely angry about the current mumps epidemic among hundreds of university students.Since this summer, more than , cases of this dangerous and infectious disease have been reported. If untreated it can lead to deafness, meningitis, and can reduce male fertility.It’s a direct result of parents refusing to let their kids be given the MMR jab when the recent crop of sufferers were babies at the turn of the century.Scare stories about MMR being linked with autism led to parents opting out of immunisation and now we are reaping the whirlwind.Health officials have urged anyone who hasn’t had the jab to do so immediately and have warned of a “public health time bomb”.There’s also been a surge in the cases of measles, a disease that can kill.It is outrageous that we are fortunate enough to have the science to eradicate these diseases completely, and save millions of lives in the process, but through misinformation, stubbornness and, even in a few cases sheer laziness, measles and mumps are being allowed to flourish once more.We need to get a grip and protect our babies, children and young people from harm that is easily preventable.WELL done to Great British Bake Off runner-up Steph Blackwell for being so refreshingly honest about her struggles with ious eating disorders.The -year-old, who was a joy to watch on the show, wants to help other people struggling with anorexia, bulimia and depression and to reassure them that things can get better.When she was , and in the grip of the illness, she would never have imagined one day she would be enjoying baking in front of the nation.Steph is proof that debilitating and often le-threatening eating disorders can be brought under control with understanding and the right kind of help.More power to her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is now vital, economically and politically, the Tories pump money into those regions and transform them.The gap between them and London has been too wide too long.And our re-elected PM was dead right to make that his priority in his first speech at No since winning his thumping majority.We must “unite and level up”, he said. Exactly.Remainers may take a while to “unite”, to “heal”. But the levelling-up can start now, by spending on infrastructure, including big transport improvements.That, admittedly, takes years. In the short-term, low-tax zones and other tax breaks can revive High Streets and lure job-creating firms out of big cities and into regions which need the boost.More money for public services is key too. The NHS, social care and crime are priorities across the country. So are many more affordable homes.Visible improvements can be made rapidly, such as with a new determination to end rough sleeping, as the Blair Government almost did.For years The Sun backed the Tories as they cut spending to fix the chaos Labour left in .That work is largely done — and, let’s face it, public patience for penny-pinching is at an end.We will trust a Tory Chancellor infinitely more than a Marxist one to spend prudently without bankrupting us.Equally exciting is the power Boris now has both to reinvent the civil service to deliver on national priorities and to reshape our politics.The Tories have a golden chance to rebrand and recast themselves as the party of working people, of Sun readers — and end the lefties’ tired mantra that they serve only the rich.It is also time to fix the anti-Tory bias in our election system.It is incredible their big win came even despite constituency boundaries favouring Labour. These must be redrawn.Two years ago we said Britain needed a strong Tory majority to improve lives and take big decisions to reform public services. It has finally come true.We heartily congratulate the many new Tory MPs. Chiefly, though, we congratulate three men.One is Isaac Levido, the party’s talented and driven Aussie elections guru.The other two, Dominic Cummings and Boris himself, have genuinely made history twice, against staggering odds.They took on the Remainer establishment and won the Brexit vote in . Now they have crushed the Remainers’ long refusal to deliver on it.In one momentous instant, as the exit poll dropped at pm on Thursday, these men ended three and a half years of ­political purgatory and paralysis.All the trickery and plots of duplicitous Remainer MPs and their rogue Speaker Bercow to reverse the referendum came to nothing.All the expensive legal cases, the collusion with EU officials, the long PR campaign of hatred towards Leavers and Boris . . . all were for nothing.In that one moment Boris won his mandate, Brexit was secured and the “People’s Vote” charade destroyed.Corbynism — which had terried millions, not least Britain’s Jews — was instantly over too and the nation liberated from the shadow of hard-left extremism.Then one Brexit-blocking MP after another was dumped by voters.Cummings’s and Boris’s achievements cannot be overstated. They are victories on a dferent scale even from Tony Blair’s against an exhausted Tory Party.As for what remains of Blair’s party we say this: It is staggering to see Corbyn cling on, plainly hoping to stitch up the leadership for some hard-left successor.That will just guarantee ­perpetual irrelevance.He, McDonnell, Seumas Milne, their Momentum social justice warriors and their repugnant media foghorns must be driven out NOW.With a few honourable exceptions, Labour’s “moderate” MPs and voters have shown a repugnant lack of spine by failing to do so already.Indeed the hypocrisy of politicians like Jess Phillips and Stella Creasy has never been plainer, begging Britain to hand power to Corbyn and his anti-Semitic, terrorist-supporting mob, then denouncing them the instant they lost.These unprincipled charlatans backed a Marxist manesto, only to turn on it once voters recoiled. Shame on them. It may be too late anyway. Labour looks irredeemably in the grip of hard-left cranks. Do Phillips and Wes Streeting really need five more years of this  We look forward to a bloodletting like this once-great party has never seen.“Change is coming”, Corbynistas used to say, with no little menace.It sure is.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Wrong.There are simply not that many avocado-munching Marxists in the country, comrade.Labour has spent years calling the .million people who voted to leave the European Union stupid, ­racist, pig-ignorant peasants.This is just in — calling people stupid is not a vote-winner.And now, this sorry excuse for a Labour Party has been given the apocalyptic kicking it so richly deserved.Under the extremist stewardship of Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell and the brain-dead thugs of Momentum, Labour happily abandoned the working class. And now the working class has abandoned Labour. My guess — for ever.The North is blue. The Red Wall has fallen. Great Grimsby. Scunthorpe. Even Bolsover — home of Dennis Skinner, the erstwhile “Beast of Bolsover” — is Tory today.And Stoke-on-Trent, Wolverhampton North East and Sedgefield — Tony Blair’s safe Labour seat for so many years — are sending Conservative MPs to Westminster.The great mystery is how Labour ever deluded itself that this country could embrace a party leader who has licked the grimy toenails of Hamas, Hezbollah, the IRA and indeed, it seems, any Brit-hating terrorist that would cheerfully do a jig on all our graves.This country will never elect a leader who openly despises the nation he seeks to represent. Why would we Labour — this jaw-droppingly out-of-touch Labour Party, this North London protest group masquerading as a serious political party — forgot why it was founded more than a century ago.And no, it wasn’t to represent a bunch of privately educated revolutionaries in Islington. It was to stand up for the working man and woman.Labour spat on the very people it was meant to represent. And now watch Labour choking on its own spit.Brexit — and the endless sneering at Brexit, and the thwarting of Brexit, and the endless attempts to abort Brexit — was just the start of Labour’s spectacular fall.Corbyn’s Labour never understood the working class.Hear this, comrade — the working class do not want handouts. They are not victims. They can’t be bought with glass beads, shiny trinkets and promises of free broadband.And they do not think they should apologise for being British and for loving this country and its history.All across our nation, working-class communities decided that the Conservatives were the true party of the working class.And let’s be honest, those Labour-voting heartlands have always had plenty of reasons to NOT vote Tory.Although Boris’s spectacular victory is being compared to Mrs Thatcher’s glory years, Maggie was always heartily despised in the regions where they built ships and mined for coal and did jobs where you got your hands dirty.For when these hard-working communities were tossed on the scrapheap of changing times, there seemed scant sympathy or understanding in Maggie Thatcher’s Conservative Party about the human cost of deindustrialisation.Analysis by the Financial Times shows that the more low-paid, low-skilled workers living in a constituency, the better the Tories did.Think about it — the Tories are the party fighting for struggling families now.And their victory is so complete that the leaders of the two opposition parties, Jo Swinson and Jeremy Corbyn, have either resigned or are about to resign.These men and women in those post-industrial communities saw their families suffer dreadfully when the old industries died.They were never going to vote for Jeremy Corbyn and his Communist clowns.But getting them to actually break the habit of a letime and vote Tory signals an historic change in our politics.After this week, the old tribal party loyalties have gone for ever.It no longer matters a damn how your parents and your grandparents voted.Boris Johnson has been swept to power by millions who never voted Tory in their lives. Now he has to keep them.And he has to show he is a Prime Minister who understands that there is a country beyond the M.Brexit is just the start.The Prime Minister’s in-tray is piled high with the housing crisis, rising crime and communities across our nation that feel totally forgotten by Westminster. Brexit should have been done and dusted years ago.And the only reason it is not is because the establishment cynically thwarted the result of the  EU referendum.But all the yakking about revoking Article , and a second referendum, and arcane Parliamentary procedures, and cobblers about a “People’s Vote” is suddenly in the past.If Remainers want us to be members of the EU then they must now be prepared to campaign for decades.The Brexit debate is over and Boris Johnson has a mandate to reshape our country as a global nation that is open to trade with the world.Frankly, Boris’s election campaign was uninspired.Boris beat Corbyn the way that boxer Anthony Joshua beat roly-poly Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabi — safety first, nothing fancy, just stay on the end of your jab and, above all, WIN. Because the consequences of losing were just too bloody awful to contemplate.Butthe campaign was uninspiring, Boris remains an inspirational politician.People like him. He gives them optimism and hope. He puts a smile on faces.His enemies paint him as a racist, right-wing bigot but the man is exactly the opposite.Boris is a tolerant, big-hearted, one-nation Tory with a razor-sharp mind and an endlessly generous spirit.The newspaper article that is always cited as evidence of his racism — the one where he compared women in full-body burkas to a letter box — was actually advocating their right to dress any way they choose, no matter how ridiculous it looks.There is no hatred in Boris Johnson. There is no poison. And God knows there has been a poisonous atmosphere in our politics for years.I live in an inner-city, safe Labour seat, and usually there would be the leaflets of three or four parties represented in the windows of our neighbourhood.But there were no leaflets in windows at this election. Because there is too much hatred abroad, too much toxic ision, too many idiots willing to stick a brick through the window of someone who dares to disagree with them.Whatever our beliefs, the great hope now must be that we can start coming together as a country, and begin to heal, and start building some kind of national unity.A Tory Prime Minister elected by the working class seems a good place to start.My parents — a Labour-voting mum and a Liberal-voting dad — despised the Tories as the party of the rich, the privileged, the out-of-touch toffs.That sentiment has been shared by millions of ­working-class men and women since the end of World War Two. Until now.From the Black Country to Blyth Valley, we are all Tories now.It is ironic that it took an Old Etonian Oxford graduateto make the Tories the natural party of the working class.And now Prime Minister Johnson and his new Tories must prove they are worthy of all those working-class votes.And let us hope that the Labour Party can find its soul again.Let us hope that this formerly great party of compassion, social justice and equality can kick out all the bigots, middle-class Reds, IRA groupies, friends of Hamas and Hezbollah and the anti-Semites who would rather wave the Palestinian flag than the Union Jack.But it is likely that ­Labour has already been dumped in the recycling bin of history.Because this doesn’t feel like a defeat for the Labour Party. It feels more like a death.It is hard to see how Labour can crawl out from under this landslide.These last years have not really been about party politics. They have been about the will of the people coming into direct conflict with the will of the establishment.The combined forces of the House of Commons and House of Lords, the BBC and Channel , the Supreme Court and expensive lawyers, RADA revolutionaries like Hugh Grant, Steve Coogan and Emma Thompson, all placed themselves above people.All of the political paralysis, and the national humiliation of never getting Brexit done, and the endless frustration of seeing democracy being cheated stems from an arrogant establishment that refused to accept the largest vote for anything in our history.What a shameful, anti-democratic place this country would bethey had won. But they lost. Now let us move forward at last.Millions of working-class men and women just placed their faith in a decent, ­brilliant, chubby-cheeked, shaggy-haired, dog-loving toff to deliver a better tomorrow for ALL of our people.As unlikely as it seems, you are a working-class hero now, Boris.Andyou make your supporters proud to be working-class Tories, then you, Carrie and your dog Dilyn will be in No for the next ten years. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there was a moment when I knew we’d absolutely had it.The BBC’s Nick Robinson was questioning Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell. “The Conservative message, ‘Get Brexit Done’, is very clear. What’s yours ”There was an audible gulp from Mr McDonnell, a pause, followed by patter so inconsequential that I now can’t recall it word for word. And that’s the point. If you are asking people to lend you the most precious thing they have in a democracy — their vote — you have to be able to say why.On Brexit, was Labour’s leader Jeremy Corbyn in favour of leaving the EU with his “sensible deal”, or of staying in it  He didn’t seem to know — orhe did he was keeping it from the electorate.There has not been a more abject failure of leadership by the head of any British political party since the war.Mr Corbyn, Mr McDonnell and their puppet-master, Len McCluskey, now blame not themselves but Brexit for Labour’s night of shame. But our Brexit dficulties were largely brought about by Mr Corbyn. They started with the  EU referendum.For most of that campaign, he was invisible. Only reluctantly was he persuaded to say something. When he did, it was without enthusiasm.There’s a reason for Mr Corbyn’s indecision on Brexit. The Jeremy Corbyn I knew in  years in the Commons was the man who voted against every EU treaty change — and left the strong impression he couldn’t stand the institution. But scared to fight for it, he put his party into the worst position, of having no position at all.But Brexit was just a symptom of Labour’s problems. Their cause was Mr Corbyn, what he stood for. He and those who have propped him up can body-swerve as much as they want.They have to face up to this unpalatable truth. Mr Corbyn was convincedthat the more left-wing Labour’s manesto, the more votes we would get.He didn’t disappoint. It was even more left-wing that our last effort like that — Labour’s  manesto, tagged “the longest suicide note in history”.I back far greater public spending than are the Conservatives. It’s one reason why I have been in Labour for  years.I want a fairer society, with greater equality, better opportunities and no discrimination. But you have to take people with you on this journey, and remember that it’s their money that will be paying for it.Mr McDonnell and Mr Corbyn forgot this. They tried to promise everything at once, in a single incontinent splurge. The result was inevitable. The party fell flat on its face.Last was the terrible scourge of anti-Semitism Mr Corbyn allowed to gain hold in the party until it was too late. We were indelibly stained.After Labour’s  election defeat, Neil Kinnock did the honourable thing and announced he was going.He didn’t hang around in a transparent attempt to organise the election of a successor, which is what it appears Mr Corbyn is doing — asmore of the same toxic mixture is going to work. It can’t.I love the Labour Party and all the decent things it stands for, and has done for our society. We can have a future, but onlywe break with the dismal Corbyn agenda and have a leader and organisation that can take us on that long journey.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Epstein groomed her for his use as a sexual object, then lured her to his ranch in New Mexico, where he subjected her to a vicious, prolonged sexual assault.We write now to seek your co-operation to bring out the truth about his predatory behaviour. You are no doubt aware by now that Mr Epstein was a skilled manipulator and abuser of minor girls. A central element of that predatory behaviour was to present himself as having connections to the world’s most powerful people.After Mr Epstein sexually assaulted Jane Doe  in New Mexico, his representative contacted her again to attempt to lure her to Mr Epstein’s private island. In trying to persuade her, Mr Epstein’s representative conveyed to Jane Doe  that Mr Epstein was close to you, that you would be among the guests and that she would have an opportunity to meet you. Your prestige and reputation were directly touted in his attempts to engage in further harm.We urge you now to actively participate in providing sworn testimony to the FBI, and voluntarily to submit to a sworn deposition in Jane Doe ’s lawsuit.“Epstein’s description of the women sleeping around him on the floor made her immediately think of slaves.”While on the flight, the financier also name-dropped former President Bill Clinton and asked the girl how old she was, the documents say.The lawsuit said: “Jane Doe  found her interactions with Epstein on the plane strange.But she recognised one of the other girls on the plane as a model who had been on a magazine cover that month.“Jane Doe  remembers finding that reassuring, and thinking: ‘If she’s here, it must be ok’.The palace declined to comment on the Sunday Times report but Andrew denied any knowledge of, or involvement with, Epsteins alleged abuse during an interview with the BBC.A Palace spokesman said the Duke unequivocally regrets his ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein and deeply sympathises with those affected who want some form of closure.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And MPs were also tipping Monmouth MP David Davies, who ran the party’s election campaign in Wales, for the job - pointing out he is a fluent Welsh speaker.Ousted Tory Cabinet minister Zac Goldsmith could also be replaced, although he didn’t run a department meaning Mr Johnson could trim down the number of seats around his top table.The PM is expected to hand Mr Goldsmith a place in the Lords to reward his environmental credentials - and could then retain his Cabinet post in the New Year.Senior Tory MP Nigel Evans said: “There’s huge demand to put Zac Goldsmith in the House of Lords so he can continue with this environmental job.“I want to see that happen because he’s hugely popular among the party faithful because he’s been doing a great job on the environmental.“It would also be a great signal that he’s absolutely sincere on climate change.”Mr Evans also revealed that the  Tory MPs on the executive committee of the powerful  committee and the party’s chief whip Mark Spencer held a secret sweepstake on how big the Tory majority would be.The result will be revealed on Wednesday, with the loser buying the winner a bottle of champagne.Mr Evans, the Treasurer of the powerful committee, says he is confident of winning having predicted a -seat majority.Summing up what PM’s message will be to his new MPs today, a Number  source said last night: “The seismic events on Thursday ed Conservative MPs in Bolsover, in Blythe and in Bishop Auckland to name but a few.“This election and the new generation of MPs that have resulted from labour towns turning blue will help change our politics for the better.“The PM has been very clear that we have a responsibility to deliver a better future for our country and that we must repay the publics trust by getting Brexit done.“Thats why the first piece of legislation new MPs will vote on will be the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. By getting Brexit done this One Nation Conservative Government will help this country move forward.We will invest in our National Health Service, in our Schools, in creating safer streets, better hospitals and building a better Britain for everyone in this country, regardless of how they voted.

The Northern MP’s pragmatic left-wing politics and engaging personality are a winning combination to woo back working class voters and repair damage inflicted by pathological liar Boris Johnson’s wrecking ball. Nandy, , will declare shortly she’s running, with Gtr Manchester mayor Andy Burnham and one-time deputy leadership contender Jon Cruddas already on her campaign team. I understand she has approached Unite, GMB, CWU and other unions to construct a coalition extending to businesses, joking to colleagues she would love to be endorsed by the Heinz factory in her constituency. Tough behind her smile, industrial Wigan guarantees that she connects with grafters who deserted Labour better than Jeremy Corbyn ever did. Newsnight inquisitor-in-chief Emily Maitlis observed Labour’s outgoing leadership stupidly ignored Nandy’s warnings the party desperately needed to engage with the forgotten towns now flirting with the Tories. I have known that Conservative MPs have feared Nandy for a while. A Yorkshire Tory confided three years ago he was relieved she wasn’t leader after she eviscerated Theresa May over child sex abuse scandals while standing in at PMQs. When a majority of Labour MPs are female, it’s historically shameful that a party preaching equality has decided that for  years the best person for the top job was always a man. The next leader should be from their talented group of women. Nandy may be up against Angela Rayner, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Emily Thornberry and Jess Phillips in the race.

Outspoken Corbyn critic Jess Phillips also broke cover today with an article saying a New Labour approach would be delusional but the party must be brave to reconnect with working-class voters. It means Labour could finally choose its first female leader in a race expected to kick off after Christmas and finish before Easter.Apart from Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer most of the leading possible contenders are female, including Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner and Corbyn alliesapos choice Rebecca Long-Bailey.Ms Nandy said Labour must regain its status as a coalition for both Lewisham and Leigh and bring Labour home to those who voted Tory. She also said she may vote for Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit deal this week -he allows scrutiny on a customs union at its committee stage in January.She told BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show: The reason I’m thinking about it is because we’ve just had the most shattering defeat where you really felt in towns like mine that the earth was quaking. And we’ve watched the entire Labour base just crumble beneath our feet. The winner will rest heavily on who Labouraposs ,-strong, left-leaning membership, which more than doubled since Jeremy Corbyn ran for leader, swing behind.  Labour centrists are already urging those who share their values to sign up to membership of the party to get a vote. That means the freeze date - the cut-off for how long-standing members have to be to get a vote - could be crucial. In , Labouraposs ruling NEC tried to block anyone whoaposd joined more recently than in  months from voting. But the decision was overturned by Court of Appeal, something the new NEC - now dominated by the left - will have to consider. Some left-wing figures are already circling around Rebecca Long-Bailey, with Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon privately putting himself forward as a candidate for deputy.  A source played down talk of a joint ticket but said: Richard wants to see Rebecca as the next Labour leader. That could see the Shadow Business Secretary running against her flatmate Angela Rayner for the top job. One party figure said: The real question is whether Angela and Beccyaposs friendship is strong enough to withhold the external pressure. A Corbyn loyalist described Ms Long-Bailey as the leftaposs only hope - but admitted they werenapost over-enthusiastic about Mr Burgon. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey could be a brilliant leader before praising shadow cabinet ministers Angela Rayner, Richard Burgon and Dawn Butler.  Another Labour source predicted the race will be a very crowded field, at least at first. Ms Nandy, who has campaigned for left-behind towns, today called for Labouraposs headquarters to move out of London in order to reconnect the party with voters outside of the capital. We should move our party conferences back to towns as well as cities, she added.She claimed it was undoubtedly true that Jeremy Corbyn is to blame for the devastating defeat after Labour won  seats in the general election , its worst showing since ."},{"url":null,"title":"mirror readers say what labour","story":"NewsMirror readers have their say on Labours failings - and what they should do nextBe it Brexit, Corbyn, anti-Semitism, or socialism, here Daily Mirror readers give their views on the key factors many feel lay behind the Tory victoryShareCommentsByFiona ParkerRhian Lubin:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsThe party’s ruling body is expected to meet on January  to agree how and when to replace Jeremy Corbyn - who provoked fury with comments on the election defeat\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Now, it’s your turn. It seems Labour could have a new leader by the end of March so it may help them to listen to our readers about what the party now needs. The party’s ruling body is expected to meet on January  to agree how and when to replace Jeremy Corbyn - who provoked fury today with comments on the election defeat. Senior figures reacted with dismay and anger to his insistence that Labour “won the argument” - despite losing  seats at the general election . Below, Daily Mirror readers give their views on the key factors many feel lay behind the Tory victory - be it Brexit , Corbyn, anti-Semitism, or socialism, here. But also, most importantly for Labour’s future, what you think must happen now within the party. If Labour is to rise from the ashes, what next  Here are a selection of your views... Colin Dawson, Plymouth, Devon The scale of Labour’s defeat is staggering, especially as it is supposed to be the party that represents ordinary working class people.The ­movement was effectively betrayed by a large section of the working class, who, in turn, were let down by a deluded Labour leadership, ­ideologically stuck in the s. If Labour is even to survive, it must come into the st century and move towards the centre ground. Alan Baber, Bideford, Devon Jeremy Corbyn must resign now to allow a new leader time to bed in. Shame on the ­electorate to put their trust in a serial liar! Alex Marshal, via Facebook Corbyn should go now. We need a younger, stronger leader.The party needs to keep the same policies but get rid of the old guard and the right-wing back-stabbers. Jack Walker, Cornwall Letaposs hope Labour go back to their s centrist strategy and elect a younger, more open-minded ­well-rounded leader who can win the next election in a landslide. Nikki Read, Colchester, Essex  Labour failed because it lost touch with its grassroots supporters. I work at a GP’s surgery and was raised in a family believing in social justice yet I couldn’t connect to Corbyn. It’s time to have a woman leading. I’ve been impressed with Angela Ray­­­ner and Jess Phillips. Tony Howard, Salford, Greater Manchester Now the dust has settled we should appoint a new leader as soon as possible. Sir Keir Starmer must be in the forefront, followed by Jess Phillips.Hopefully, Johnson will dig a hole big enough for him to fall into – the NHS crisis might just be his downfall.   Mary Taylor, Fairburn, West Yorkshire Labour should have walked this election. However, they took no notice of an earlier vote on Brexit and people disliked the antiquated ideas of Corbyn and McDonnell. They promised too many things – andit sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Let’s hope Labour learn from this and choose a leader more in touch with the people’s wishes. David Carman, Ramsgate, Kent I thought that the Tories were there for the taking. Now I wish Corbyn would make way for someone like Keir Starmer or Andy Burnham.   Kieren Williams, London  This election hinged on two key points, the leaders and Brexit. Labour lost on both. Polls showed what the country thought of Corbyn, despite the merit of his manesto – whereas Johnson, a racist, misogynist fired twice for lying, was someone many could get behind. The other issue was Brexit.Johnson ­promised to end it. Labour’s policy of a new referendum made sense but meant more Brexit. Labour needs to focus on those it is supposed to represent once more. Victor Laidlow, St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex Labour has failed the working classes by not ditching Corbyn long ago.I voted to leave the EU but had reservations when the facts came out and I realised we had been lied to by Boris and Co. Corbyn should resign with immediate effect and the party must deal with anti-Semitism. Labour must work hard to rebuild trustit wants to win an election again. Gina Connor, West Yorkshire Itaposs time we had a decent candidate to lead this party back to glory. Nick Stevenson, Northampton People didn’t vote blue because they believed in Boris.They refused to vote Labour because they didn’t believe in Corbyn. Susan E Dykes, Otley, West Yorkshire I was very disappointed with the election result but not surprised. I said months ago that with Corbyn as Labour leader, we would lose. His unpopularity was a deciding factor but he was too arrogant to see this. While the manesto was ­admirable, it was totally unrealistic. What we want are promises that can be kept. Finally, Labour’s stance on Brexit went against democracy. James Edge, Dereham, Norfolk  Keeley-Jasmine Cavendish, South East London For the Conservatives to win seats such as Rother Valley and Newcastle-under-Lyme, which have been held by Labour for  years, sends the clearest message that British people have no time for the Marxist policies of the current leadership.   Stephen Laing, Stockton-on-Tees, Co Durham This is Labour’s worst result since  and two men are directly to blame – John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn.Insular, ­delusional, London-centric Marxists who have alienated core Labour supporters in my North East patch. Corbyn has yet to apologise to the  dedicated MPs who lost their seats, which shows his ego. Andrew Gardner, Chester I voted Labour all my le but not this time – and it was because of Brexit.If Keir Starmer becomes leader, I won’t vote Labour again. Stuart Jarvis, Oxford A Leopard never changes its spots and time will show you how this right-wing government will deal with our NHS, the elderly, education and homelessness. I believe Corbyn is a good man but did not have the charisma to be the leader of the Labour Party.Fortunately, we have many talented politicians who could replace Corbyn – Andy Burnham is one. We must never let this country become overrun with greed.We need to be a more caring society and only a Labour government can deliver this. Victor Rones, Backnell, Berkshire  As a loyal supporter, I wish Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party all the best. I think that Emily Thornberry or Sir Keir Starmer would make good leaders as they are outspoken and would stand up to Boris Johnson at the Despatch Box. I believe the party must now go towards the centre a little. The manesto was good but they put too much in there. It was overloaded with ideas and plans, and people were confused by it, whereas the Tory manesto was a flimsy document but had a simple message.

Ian Levy shot to prominence on Friday after winning former mining community Blyth Valley, Labour since , in the first big upset of election night. But he now faces questions over a post on his Facebook page dated November  which originally said: As an NHS nurse myself, I am immensely proud of the investment by our Conservative government. This post was edited  days later and now describes him as an NHS mental health nursing assistant. A local NHS worker told the Mirror that despite sounding similar, the two roles were very dferent as becoming a registered nurse takes several years and can carry the power to detain people under the Mental Health Act. Colleagues were angry that he would lie about being a nurse to win votes, the worker claimed. They said: Nursing has professional status and thus comes with a level of trust within society. I am not dismissive of the role that nursing assistants and support workers play - they do a superb job. But there is a huge dference between the two roles.Mr Levy does not appear on the register of nurses held by the Nursing and Midwery Council , and his local NHS trust told Nursing Times that he was employed as a healthcare assistant.Another comment that is still on his Facebook page claims: I have worked for  years as a mental health nurse with the NHS. And the Mirror was sent a screenshot of a reply to the original post, from a Facebook user which said Nursing assistant Ian, which appeared to have been deleted. Judith Ellis, a former interim chair at the NMC, told Nursing Times that Mr Levy had not technically broken any rules as he did not use the full protected title registered nurse.  She told Nursing Times: I think he has misledhe’s said that he’s a mental health nurse, but it’s not protected so the NMC can do nothing. That’s the game he’s played. “He’s changed it now to a healthcare assistant in mental health, so he’s obviously aware. “This is my concern, that it happens all the time. It’s dficult, because you don’t say ‘somebody midwived someone’ but you do say ‘nursed.’ It’s a tricky one. But by not [protecting the term] we undermine the profession. It’s not fair and it deceives the public.” "},{"url":null,"title":"top labour mp accuses bbc","story":"NewsTop MP accuses BBC of consciously playing a part in Labours election defeatAndy McDonald, the Shadow Transport Secretary, clashed furiously with a BBC presenter after Labours worst election defeat since  - saying he was very worried about our public service broadcasterShareCommentsBySam BlewettDan BloomOnline Political EditorGeorge Ryan:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video andy-mcdonald-accuses-bbc-bias-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics top-labour-mp-accuses-bbc-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA top Labour MP has accused the BBC of consciously playing a part in the partyaposs worst election defeat since . Andy McDonald descended into a furious clash with presenter Justin Webb as he appeared to allege a deliberate attempt to hurt Labour on the part of the state broadcaster. The Shadow Transport Secretary accepted we got this terribly wrong - but joined John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn in putting some blame on the media. And he went further by point the finger directly at the BBC. It comes as the Tories also wage war on the BBC over supposed bias aposagainst Brexitapos. Ministers are boycotting the Today programme and threatening to cut funding by £m by decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee. BBC Radio aposs Today programme presenter Justin Webb asked Mr McDonald about Labouraposs heavy losses and whether the partyaposs leader played a part in that. An Opinium poll last week found % of people who didnapost vote Labour cited the partyaposs leadership as their reason. But Mr McDonald said: Donapost get me started on the media, Justin. Iaposm very worried about our public service broadcaster. Are you saying that the BBC was in part responsible for Mr Corbynaposs loss  Webb asked. Mr McDonald replied: I am saying that they played a part. Iaposm really worried about the drt. Youaposve seen the catalogue of criticisms that weaposre making. Weaposve accepted that the print media are rained against us, but my goodness me. Iaposm going to look at us. Weaposre the important part here. We got this wrong, butthe BBC are going to hold themselves out as somehow having conducted themselves in an impartial manner, I think theyaposve really got to have a look in the mirror. Weaposve got a lot to say about this. Askedthe BBC consciously played a part, Mr McDonald replied: Consciously, yes. The BBC was hit by a string of rows over its coverage of the election campaign.  Its political editor was among journalists who tweeted unconfirmed reports that a Tory aide had been punched during a hospital visit. The reports later turned out to be  briefings from Tory sources - and branded a bare-faced lie by Labour. The elections watchdog also issued a warning after Laura Kuenssberg said postal vote s were grim for Labour. Viewing or sharing postal votes is banned under electoral law. The BBC said she had not broken the law. The BBC also said it accidentally used old footage of Boris Johnson laying a wreath at the Cenotaph, rather than this yearaposs clip in which he laid it upside down. A clip of a correspondent went viral after she said Boris Johnson deserves victory in what the BBC called a slip of the tongue. And the BBC accepted it made a mistake by editing a clip of Question Time to cut out audience laughter when Boris Johnson was asked about telling the truth. Meanwhile, the Tories were angry after interviewer Andrew Neil empty-chaired Boris Johnson - because he chickened out of an interview - with a devastating monologue on the Tory leaderaposs record and trustworthiness. Mr McDonald said: When you have a BBC presenter standing in front of a television camera saying aposand Boris Johnson is on his way to a richly-deserved victoryapos. Webb said: Oh, itaposs a slip of the tongue. Thataposs absolute madness, isnapost it  Mr McDonald said: How many slips of the tongue are we going to make until you accept it  I think itaposs a distraction, quite frankly. Because Iaposm accepting that we got this wrong ... you asked me about Jeremy Corbyn, Iaposll say to you quite clearly: he is a principled, decent man and heaposs vilied. I had in my constituency where posters were going up saying this man is effectively a paedophile, aposyou would not trust this man with your childrenapos. How much more do we need to do to demonise a good inidual  So, heaposs no longer going to be leader. The Brexit issue is going to be progressed, weaposre going to be out of the European Union on January  and we as the Labour Party have to galvanise around our core principles and make sure that we deliver for our people. Itaposs as simple as that. BBC director general Tony Hall emailed staff on Friday saying: In a frenetic campaign where we’ve produced hundreds of hours of output, of course we’ve made the odd mistake and we’ve held up our hands to them. Editors are making tough calls every minute of the day. But I don’t accept the view of those critics who jump on a handful of examples to suggest we’re somehow biased one way or the other. Election night presenter Huw Edwards waded in on Sunday, saying the toxic cynicism and accusations of biasare adding to the pressures on the entire team.

He brands himself the parkaposs unofficial night watchman - keeping the grounds free of trouble and graffiti.Speaking to Cornwall Live , Brian said: When I first came down here in September  I had just done the South West footpath. I couldn’t decide where I wanted to go to be homeless.“It’s quite a big decision. There are lots of dferent places to choose from.  I decided to give here a go and now they can’t get rid of me. “I’m the unofficial night watchman.” Brian is well known in the area and often people will bring him food and stop by for a chat.The only time he has to move is when football matches are played - which in the current weather isnapost very often.He added: When they have a game I pack up all my stuff and put it behind the wall.

The -year-old revealed he used to be an airline pilot and has been to places that most people can only dream of. “Hawaii and Fiji are like heaven on earth,” he says as he reminisces about old times. He says he worked for the UN in Vietnam and saw the true meaning of poverty while working in some of the poorest African nations in the s. When he failed his medical examination he lost his pilot’s licence and moved to London for a new start. “My career ended very abruptly so I started another one in London,” he says. He worked as a chef in London, Birmingham and Torquay but his le took a dramatic turn in his mid-s.   “That’s when the housing crisis arrived in the beginning of  and I said ‘sod it let’s try it the other way’.

Jeff Baker, who has cooked for the likes of the Queen, previously told how we were all cooking bacon wrong. And now the award-winning Michelin-starred cook has lted the lid on how to get the perfect bangers - in five easy steps. Jeff has more than three decades experience in a professional kitchen, and has worked with some of the best in the business - so he knows his stuff. The Executive Development Chef now works at Farmison  Co and has shared his simple secrets and warned of the common errors.... . Remove the sausage from the chiller  minutes before cooking This helps the sausage to cook evenly and prevents the skin from splitting when it is confronted with heat, Jeff told the Daily Star. . Pop your bangers in the pan Use a heavy based non-stick frying pan, place on a low to medium heat. . Add a teaspoon of duck or goose fat to the pan Then swirl around until the base is fully coated then tip away any excess fat.  . Place the sausages in the pan, making sure theyaposre not touching each other and keep on a constant heat Turning them regularly ensures the bangers get a rich golden colour. Jeff recommends  to  minutes for a traditional thick sausage. . Rest the bangers before serving Once cooked, the sausage will be firm to touch, with an internal temperature of °C. The secret now is to let the sausages rest for a few minutes, just like you would a steak allowing the meat to relax, giving you a tender, juicy sausage. Changing your cooking methods can be tricky, especiallyyou think your way of making sausages is best. Mistakes people make when cooking sausages  . Pricking the skins when cooking quality sausages with high meat content and natural skins This can cause juices will run out and youaposll end up with a dry tasteless sausage. . Never deep fry Doing so can make the skin tough and the sausage dry. . Donapost bake your sausages While this seems like the healthy option, it doesnapost provide the fry-up experience that pan cooking does. Baking prevents the exterior from developing that lovely umami taste we all crave. Meanwhile, Jeff has also revealed when it comes to cooking curry he believes that to make the most of our spices, we should instead apostemperapos them in a pan.

It detected pregnancy by inducing menstruation in women who were not pregnant.

But when the then size  childrenaposs nanny saw photos of the night she was mortied and vowed to lose weight. Emma, from Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, admits she has been a yoyo dieter all her le. The -year-old says she used to scoff double dinners and biscuits and her weight had reached stone lbs when the pictures were taken in . She said: I knew I was big, but the turning point came after seeing myself in a photo from a work Christmas do in December . I’d felt quite glamorous on that night. I liked the dress I’d bought, so it was quite a shock when I saw the picture and realised how big I was. It felt like every bit of me was bursting out of the dress.  And when she visited her GP for a review of her contraceptive Pill, Emma was referred to the slimming club WW. The mum-of-one has now shed a massive six stone and was a slim size  when she married partner, Russell Baas in July last year. Her wedding dress even needed to be taken in from a size  to a size  before her big day. Emma said: I was overweight at school and would get bullied. At home, food was always there. There would be a pudding with every meal. I did lose some weight when I was , but the bullies found something  to pick on, so I went back to my old ways. As an adult, I tried dferent diets, but never really stuck to anything, and eventually got to st lb and was wearing a size . When the photo that changed everything was taken ft ins Emma had a body mass index of . compared to the NHS recommended figure of between . to ., meaning she was obese.  Emma, who has a son Zac, eight, and a teenage stepson, said: Food had always been a massive comfort to me, so I had grown used to eating on my feelings and had just been getting bigger and bigger. I told myself I didn’t care what I looked like, but really I was feeling so rubbish about myself. My self-esteem was at rock bottom, so I didn’t feel like it mattered what I was eating. But her weight was taking its toll on her health and saw her struggling with the physical demands of her nannying job. She said:always had bad knees and my back always hurt. I had quite a physical job as a nanny and found getting the children in and out of the car quite hard. I never had any portion control and would eat a lot of carbs, like a big portion of lasagne and chips for tea. I would sometimes eat two dinners, eating my main meal at work then a bowl of cereal when I got home, or the other way round.  I’d sit with a friend and we’d think nothing of sharing a whole packet of biscuits between us. I went on dating apps but that was bad for my confidence. Iaposd look my best in the picture, but when dates meet me theyaposd realise Iaposm a bigger girl and that would be it. Iaposve got a history of depression, so looking after myself hasnapost always been important. I always foundI was having a bad patch I would turn to food for comfort and my healthy lestyle became more of a battle. In January , soon after seeing the shocking photo from her Christmas do, Emma had a routine appointment at her GP surgery and was referred to WW. She said: The WW system would give me control over my portion sizes. Nothing was off limits which really helped. My weight loss journey has been slow - it’s taken me three and a half years and a lot of hard work because I did it in small steps, rather than having a massive loss - but itaposs worked.  Slowly but surely, Emma, who was no longer with her sonaposs dad, started to win her battle of the bulge. She said: I’ve always been a plodder and it is hard to keep motivatedyou’re just losing the odd pound. Mine isn’t a typical story really. My weight came off very slowly and there were set backs, as I had some short relationships which had ended but it’s still signicant and I want people to know that losing weight is dferent for everyone, and not to give up. I set mini goals. I knew, for example, thatthe school holidays were coming up there would be constant picnics, so it became about maintaining my weight rather than losing it.I’d also post progress photos on Instagram to try and monitor how I was doing.Thein in Januaru, , Emma met Russell, , online. He proposed the following December at the ice rink at the Natural History Museum in London, spurred Emma on.  Emma said: The wedding was planned for that July, so for the next six months I had a massive incentive to motivate me. I started going to the gym and invested in a personal trainer, having previously done no exercise. I would go to the gym two or three times a week. I got a step tracker and started walking into work, becoming quite competitive about getting my steps in. I bought my wedding dress in January and it was a size , but I should have bought a size , as by the time of our wedding my body shape changed so much, because of the exercise. The alterations cost almost as much as the dress. I know a lot of brides buy a dress too small as motivation but I didn’t want that kind of pressure. If Iaposd fallen over and broken my leg and not been able to exercise I would never have lost that weight.Before the wedding, Emma enjoyed the fruits of her labour in the gym when she bought a size  playsuit for her hen night, which made her feel on top of the world. She said: It was really special going shopping for my hen weekend. It had always been a real challenge finding things that had fitted. I would hide away in baggy clothes, but this was completely dferent. It was an amazing feeling wearing the playsuit, then going on to walk down the aisle in my wedding dress, knowing I was looking the best I possibly could. It was something I did myself, nobody  did it for me. It was hard work, but it was a real achievement. Wearing her wedding dress was just one of the many memorable experiences that made Emmaaposs weight loss feel worthwhile. She said: I cried when I bought my first pair of size  shorts. And it was a monumental feeling dropping into the  stone bracket in March this year.

The force of  elite troopers are on standby   and can reach the scene of an attack within minutes. The unit was formed following the Paris attacks in  and will use a Eurocopter AS Dauphin to deal with high-threat situations in theUK.

I went to the shops and bought her some lollies as well, just to put her in an even better mood. The teen said when her mum first saw the application she burst out laughing and stood firm on her answer of no, but gave in after reading the CV and cover letter in detail.  Kayla, who works as a pizza maker, is now the proud owner of adorable little Bandit and is happier than ever. She explained: When [her mum] got home, Iaposd laid out the lollies and my work on the kitchen table, and then I asked her there and then for a puppy. She walked in and saw it and just said aposhell no!apos and started laughing. I just said but I really want it and asked her to have a look at everything Iaposd done. She finally gave in. It took a lot of convincing, me just asking her wasnapost really enough so I had to try extra hard.

Onlookers attempted to help the horse to its feet, while others begged for the male driver to stop. Get up, fu***** lazy b***, the driver can be heard saying to the horse in footage filmed by Krista Knight. Ms Knight, a veterinary nurse, urges the driver to stop kicking the horse. Love, I know what Iaposm doing. Get out of the way, the driver shouts back. The Unique Carriage Hire driver appears to try and make a phone call before appearing to kick the horse again. The animal eventually manages to get back on her feet and it is understood she wasn’t left with any lasting injuries. Tuesday was reportedly back to work the following day. Dean Crichton, owner of Unique Carriage Hire, admitted the driver, called Wayne, lost his cool.He did not kick that horse with any malice, it was just a nudge like come on get up, likeyour mate fell over outside the pub, Mr Crichton told Daily Mail Australia . Wayne lost his cool but it was a very stressful situation with everyone yelling at him. It was out of character for him to use language like that. It would have been betterthat vet had put her phone in her pocket and helped, and they would have got the horse up straight away. Mr Crichton added his  horses spend the majority of their time in paddocks and are rotated through to look after their welfare.

The Litvinov family and their cat Zack moved into the House under the Dome in the Kangalassy industrial park in the suburbs of Yakutsk - where they will stay until the summer. The creators of the project decided to cover a one-storey building with a steel dome replete with frost-resistant PVC plastic sheeting. According to project coordinator Pavel Vasiliev, the researchers’ aim is to obtain data on the efficiency of heat consumption, the stability of the structure in severe climactic conditions. At the same time, the scientists will also monitor the physical state of the participants during the experiment. It is assumed that the temperature inside the dome will be  degrees below zero, and roughly  degrees below zero outside, so that the construction will save fuel for heating and protect the house from winds and snow. Participants Vitaly and Regina named it the “house of their dreams” and said that they are satisfied with everything: inside you can find everything you need and the ride to Yakutsk takes about half an hour."},{"url":null,"title":"whatsapp update includes three new","story":"NewsWhatsApp update includes three new features every user needs to know aboutThe messaging , used by over . billion people every month, now has new alities including reminders, call waiting and group chat invites, making it more intuitive to useShareCommentsByJoseph CareyChiara Fiorillo:,  DEC NewsWhatsApp has introduced the features over the past few weeks \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Everybody in this league would want to add quality to their squad.“Looking at the bench on Saturday at Arbroath, we are a bit short. If we get a couple of injuries then you are short but you are always looking to improve anyway.“I’ve said before, I don’t want to go back to chopping and changing  players or whatever every window. That has happened for a number of windows at this club and that has to stop.“That’s why we were so busy in the summer so we don’t have to keep doing that. It has taken a bit of time to get everything right since then.“We are looking where we are short and what we can add but it has to be quality not just to add numbers to bulk up the squad for the second half of the season.”Next up for the Dark Blues is a home clash with one of the form sides in the ision at the moment, Dunfermline.Since Dundee have taken just one point from their last , Stevie Crawford’s Pars have racked up three wins on the spin.“It shows you what can happen,” added James. “We’ve kind of switched. Dunfermline have started winning games and we’ve started losing them.“I met Stevie at a reserve game recently and we were talking about how quickly things can turn.“It shows you thatyou put a couple of results together you’re right back up there. They’re in the play-off places where we need to get back to.“It’s a big game on Saturday, we need to be really positive and take the game to them.”The Dens gaffer is wary of the threat posed by Dunfermline frontman Kevin Nisbet, who has scored  goals in his last seven matches for the Pars.But he says,his team can supply the Dundee strikers with the service Nisbet has enjoyed at East End Park then it’ll be the home attackers making the headlines.He said: “Nisbet is a player I like.“He was a threat in the first game of the season and we’ve obviously seen what he can do since then.“They get the ball into the box for him. The big thing is they’re creating the chances for him and he’s putting them away.“I believe we’ve got strikers who are every bit as good as anybody in the league – and they will score plenty of goals with the right service.Arbroath - Dundee: Dark Blues# winless run extends to four thanks to Bobby Linn#s curler\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arbroath---dundee-dark-blues-winless-run-extends-to-four-thanks-to-bobby-linns-curler embed # secrettQXpZpu\" data-secret\"tQXpZpu\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“With the strikers we’ve got in our team, we have to play to their strengths.

When you are full of confidence you try things you wouldn’t do when it’s low.“The only way it is going to come back is by picking up results and grafting in training.“Hopefully, we can turn things soon.”Dundee head back to Dens Park aiming to rebuild their relationship with the home faithful after some very disappointing displays.However, Byrne says the Pars are a perfect example of how quickly things can turn around after three straight wins has seen Stevie Crawford’s side shoot up the ision.Byrne said: “We’ve got to win the fans round but we have to do it for ourselves as well.“It’s down to us to get results. We know it hasn’t been good enough as a team and inidually, so we need to get results. Only those will get fans back onside.”He added: “You could see when we got our three wins in a row it pushed us right up the table and you can see that now with Dunfermline.“I think they were down in mid-table and now they are up in third. One result can change a lot in this league and we need that.“Dunfermline will come here confident after a few good results but we are at home and we need to use that advantage.“We had a decent home record up until the last few. We need to get wins here and make this a hard place to come.”Byrne began his career with Dunfermline in the old First Division before moving on to Livingston after three years.There are still one or two old faces around the club he remembers but the midfielder insists his only focus is on his own, and the team’s, performance.“It’s a club I know really well and they gave me a chance to play in the first team,” he added.“I have a lot of good memories there but it was a long time ago now. I want to concentrate on doing well for Dundee, though.“I know myself I’ve not been good enough. I’ve had some good games but I’ve not played well consistently enough week to week.“When we got those three wins in October I was starting to feel good. Inidually, I know I can be a lot better.“I’m not going to say I’m going to do this and that. I can only work as hard as possible and I’m sure it will come together again and I can get back to how I was playing last season and enjoying things again.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/12/Teddy-Bear-Toss-07-12-19-02.jpg ","title":"dundee stars shine for sick children with generous donation","story":"Hockey players made a n-ice gesture with a visit to Ninewells Hospital’s children’s ward.The Kitmart Dundee Stars took nearly  cuddly toys to the city hospital which had been hurled on to the ice at their annual teddy toss match.More than  bears hurtled on to the surface and smashed last year’s record total of  which were then given out to city charities.Dundee Stars captain, Matt Marquardt, was one of the players who handed out the toys to children at Ninewells and explained the touching ice hockey tradition. vw, px\"  He said: “It was a great afternoon delivering the teddy bears to the kids.“It’s always wonderful to help put smiles on the children’s faces during these dficult times for them and their families.“Also, we want to thank all the fans who contributed to the teddy bear toss.”Play specialist Una Paton added: “The children had great fun and were very excited to meet the team.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.49061354-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.49061354-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.49061354-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.49061354-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"in pictures ho ho whole lotta fun to be had in the ferry for santa sunday","story":"Broughty Ferry families lapped up all the festive fun of Santa Sunday.They braved bitterly cold conditions to visit a iety of stalls in the town, which offered a host of Christmas items and snacks.Cartoon characters in fancy dress, including Frozen  favourites Elsa and Olaf, were on hand to meet and greet the children throughout the day.And also making an appearance was film character the Grinch who tried, but failed to put a dampener on the occasion.A funfair with bumper cars and rides also proved a winner.And topping off the day was Santa’s Grotto where children lined up to ask for their special presents list to be delivered on the big day."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d95b6be541739.36658825-767x564.jpg ","title":"mcpake set to welcome back key players for dunfermline clash","story":"James McPake is set to welcome back some “key” players tomorrow against Dunfermline.The Dundee boss admits his side has been hit by absences during their bad run of form lately.With one of the league’s in-form teams checking in at Dens Park tomorrow, James is hopeful his side will get a boost from some added competition.A big miss has been left-back Jordan Marshall with a hamstring injury while striker Andrew Nelson may also be fit toto the squad.Centre-back Josh Meekings just fell short of fitness for the clash away to Arbroath last weekend and should be OK tomorrow.James said: “It was a really young bench at Arbroath.

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll and bute goes to the westminster polls","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowPolling stations were busy from the time they opened at am for the first December general election since .Polling stations will close at pm across the UK, after which Argyll and Bute ballot boxes will be transported by road, sea and air to the constituency count at Lochgilphead Joint Campus.As one of the largest and most geographically dispersed constituencies in the country # including  inhabited islands # the time between the first voting papers arriving and the last will be considerable.When all the ballot boxes have arrived and counting is complete, the results will be veried before being formally announced, with the result expected around am on Friday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

We have a UK government that is hell-bent on Brexit. Boris Johnston, with his majority, will be looking to take us out ofthe EU as quickly as possible. A no-deal Brexit is still on the table and after tonight is looming large. We should all be very worried at that prospect.#Asked how he felt, Mr O#Hara replied: #It hasn#t really hit me yet. I didn#t think the majority would be what it was, and I think this is a victory for the organisation of the SNP in Argyll and Bute.#I am very, very happy and very, very tired in equal measure.#Gary Mulvaney, who received  more votes than in the  election, commented: #I#m pleased our vote has increased, but I#ve felt like we have been swimming against the tide sometimes.

particularly bathers going through the motions and winning the No-Belle Prize - the capers and costumes were crazy, and the fun-filled score was sensational.But the true highlights of this adorable show were the tearjerkers and the heart-breaking performances of Aimee Richardson, as Belle, and Sam Johnston, as Prince Danton.The Right Angle Theatre Company has uncovered a couple of crackers with these two.Their dueted version of Calum Scotts Youre the Reason was breathtaking.Johnston had already made an impact with his remarkably good take on Im On My Way, and Richardson had shone throughout the early scenes, but once together it was veneration rather than laughter that resounded around the Volunteer Hall.Steve Hartley-Oliver didnt help either with his accomplished performance as the tormented Beast.And, while slightly more limited in his vocal range than the two leads, his performance of Lewis Capaldis Someone You Loved had most reaching for the tissues.But Beauty and the Beast is much, much more than a weep-fest.Tracy Borthwick and Emma Wilson were a hoot as Belles sisters, Whitney and Britney.From their fainting fits at the sight of Gustave to their obsession with treatments, laughs were never far away.And the dynamic duo of Stuart Mitchell and Amanda Blacklock as the Brawest beauticians in Galae, Marcell and Monique, had the hall in uproar for much of the night.Clad in Olivia Newtown-John-esque Lets Get Physical clobber from the s, Blacklock and Mitchell stole many a scene.And their accents -

Jodie Millar as Madame Fi was yet again a sensation.From wild wigs and fervently festive costumes to hilariously adapted versions of Ghostbusters and Chansom Damour, Millar made the stage his own.And he was ably supported by Billy Rooney as Fis son, Jacques.Having tumbled straight from the set of childrens show Rainbow, Rooney has a natural ability for slapstick.Rachel Falconer provided the good side of panto from the sidelines as the fairy Flora, while hitting back with her own couplets was Amy Welsh as the sinister Belladonna.,params: .pushWelsh, with her scarlet dress and green-lighting, was remarkably good as the villain.All good shows, though, rely on the music and Calders song choice was spot-on.From the Boo Radleys and Abba to Elton John and Queen, Beauty and the Beast was a foot-tapping, sing-alonging great night out.While the hits rolled, traditional favourites werent forgotten.The wonderful cast of children were delightful with their environmentally aware Country Gardens and Ugly Bugs Ball, and they made sure Coulter wasnt forgotten with a lovely version of Ally Bally Bee.Stuart Mitchell and Julie Smith should take an additional bow for the choreography.And the dancers and chorus were in fine form throughout the show with every big number being turned into a visual treat.As has become the custom with the Right Angle Theatre Companys annual panto, the loudest cheers of the night were saved for the Braw Lad and Lass as well as Santa Claus.While the mood wasnt always merry, Beauty and the Beast provided the opportunity for this talented company to showcase what they can do -

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet.

[The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended due to securing availability of key members of the project team being available to answer public questions.ldquoInvitations to the stakeholdersrsquo meeting are for two representatives from a range of organisations involved in business transport in Haddington and confirmed invitees include Haddington Business Community Partnership, Haddington Community Development Trust, East Coast Buses, Prentice Coaches, Lothian Buses."},{"url":null,"title":"pair-travel-10k-wheelchairs-help-day-centre","story":"Megan Roland from Gford and Joanne Rye from Ormiston both completed the k journey from Ormiston to Tranent and back with help from their support workers.Through sponsorship they raised pound for Ormistonrsquos Primrose Day Centre.Megan, , and Joanne, , have support needs and have required the use of wheelchairs all their lives.They duo had assistance on the trek from their support workers Catherine Mitchell and Jackie Hoy.Joanne told the Courier: ldquoIt was exciting because Jackie, Megan and Cath did it with me and my niece and sister came along too.ldquoWe did it for Alzheimerrsquos as my mum has it and I wanted to do it for the Primrose Day Centre as she goes there.ldquoIt was a very successful and very fun sponsored walk.Megan and Joanne used to live together until Megan moved out to a house of her own.They have been on holidays together, including one memorable trip to Blackpool."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10620293.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!!

Was that a man thing to do  Are most of the viewers women A panic alarm goes off in my brain. Have I said something hellip sexist  Am I about to embark on some hellip mansplaining  I trust not. Let me explain: Irsquove never considered myself much of a man. Indeed, when folk say to me, as they do pretty much daily, ldquoWhen you are reincarnated, what do you want to come back as , I always say: ldquoI think this time Irsquod like to come back as a man.No, my mission this week is to examine the effect of Outlander on Scottish culture, despite knowing little about the latter and almost nothing about the former.What I do know is I used to ken some females who were in an Outlander fan club, based on the books and before the TV series came out. And a nicer, smarter bunch of lassies you could never hope to meet.Getting more excuses in before I begin my exegesis, I should say also that, occasionally, one detects a feeling that in abjuring items of popular culture one is being aloof. Not so. Irsquove just never had much luck with tellies. The last one broke down, and the current one only gets BT Sport down the internet line. I donrsquot have an aerial for the normal stuff, and the bank wonrsquot give me a mortgage to have one installed.So, all that out of the way, you ask: ldquoWhat prompts you to bring your excellent forensic skills to the television series Outlander  Irsquom glad you asked that. The answer is that the University of Glasgow is to host a major conference on the series next year, with tip-top academics hollering about its history, customs, politics, culture, claes and music.Willy Maley, a professor at the uni, claimed outrageously: ldquoThe globally successfully Outlander series has triggered more interest in Scotland and its history than any other cultural artefact in recent years hellipI said ldquooutrageously purely for dramatic effect, as Prof Willy is indeed correct. The Outlander phenomenon is out of control, sweeping the world and bringing hordes of, er, non-male gender types to this country in the hope of fiddling with the Cairngorms of rugged, kilted men who stravaig hither and yon with their eyes ever fixed on the misty horizon.I always fear they will be disappointed by the grimy weather, grey-harled cooncil hooses, standard-issue troosers and also, well, by the men.The last great screen classic to attract worldwide attention to Wee Scotia was Braveheart, the true story of warriors in woad who fought and died for a devolution settlement based on a federalist structure.Like Outlander, it was said to be romantic, but you couldnrsquot take away the hard facts of the spectacular scenery . All in all, these popular productions are flavoured with peerie soupccedilons of our history and culture, prompting folk to take an interest and perhaps even visit, giving us in the process large sums of money for basically just standinrsquo aboot.As for Outlander itself, which my researchers say involves time travel, pirates and Cherokee Indians, Irsquom afraid its charms will continue to elude me, though I accept that it must be a fine piece of work.Perhaps someone of the female gender or preference could womansplain it to me.First-class selfishnessTHE recent General Election gave rise to discussion of two issues about which I care passionately: letterboxes and house numbers.Although few people were brave enough to deliver leaflets this time, what with the risk of being killed by liberals, those activists that did venture forth complained about dastardly letterboxes with springs and brushes that could take your pinkie off.As a sometime postie, they had my sympathy, and I was intrigued to see solutions proffered such as using spatulas, with other folk arguing for American-style letterboxes ootside the hoose.The discussion widened to the lack of hoose numbers on properties, something that provides a perfect metaphor for the thoughtlessness that dominates society in these discombobulating times.Why wouldnrsquot you want to help your postie or other purveyors of deliverance  As always with the Earthlings, only an appeal to their selfishness might help them mend their ways:you donrsquot have a house number then your Amazon parcels wonrsquot be delivered.It could be even worse. Ambulance drivers joined the debate, saying they often struggled to locate addresses. There:you donrsquot have your house name or number prominently displayed you might die. And itrsquoll serve you right.Water awakeningHOW enterprising to find someone marketing water to add to the water of le. You wonder why no one thought of it before.As everybody knows, yoursquore supposed to add a wee splash of water to your whisky. Itrsquos counter-intuitive and doesnrsquot make sense. Why add common or kitchen tap water to something thatrsquos been nurtured and matured for years But itrsquos true: it works. I already knew this when I was with a colleague relaxing in a whisky loversrsquo bar after a job. My mate rejected the water, whereupon mine host said he was a loon and to prove it, got out a wee, nose-wide glass into which he poured a dram. He got us each to snf it. Then he added a tiny drop of water and ndash wow! ndash an aromatic explosion followed. Tasted better tae.The makers of Larkfire water say it comes from Lewisian gneiss rock which is ldquometamorphic. Thatrsquos the word I was looking for. They say tap water is full of chlorine and fluoride and ldquoshouldnrsquot go near a good Scotch.Kinda makes sense and, though tap water has done a decent job so far, this stuff sounds gneisser.

Someone sent me a picture of Kai sitting at the railway station and, like everybody , I thought, Thats such a shame, an absolute nightmare.\"I went to put a donation in to the SSPCA in Cardonald not thinking about taking him, I just wanted to put a donation in to support his care. They let me meet him and once I saw his wee face I wanted to help.\"I just wanted to give him a good home. He is such a beautul dog, so gentle and a wee soul.\"Thousands of people like Mr Russell got in touch looking to rehome Kai, as the heart-warming story of Scotlands \"Paddington Ayr\" spread all over the country.The pooch is still recognised almost five years later as the dog that was abandoned at the train station, particularly when mountain climbing with his owner.Russell said: \"He is doing really well, and everywhere I go this guy gets recognised.\"I was up Ben Nevis a few weeks ago, there was plenty of snow up there. A girl just walked up and said Excuse me, is that the dog who got left at the station .\"I go to Arran a lot too, up Goatfell, and its the same there. There is a hotel at the front, the Douglas Hotel, and last time we were there just resting after walking, people were taking pictures of him as they recognised him. It just keeps going on and on. I go to Glencoe at New Year a lot and now people look forward to seeing him for Hogmanay.\"As Mr Russell works all over the country, Kai accompanies him everywhere he goes, and the two are inseparable.He explained: \"Im a hydraulics engineer and I travel about the country, I have a mobile workshop. He just sits in the van next to me, with the window open and he just sits and watches out the window.\"Everywhere I go Kai is there, and everyone recognises him and knows him. Thats been many years now and he still gets recognised.\"Kais case sparked debate and increased awareness of the online animal trade, which is unregulated and can often lead to disastrous consequences for the animals or buyers.But the shar-pei remains blissfully unaware of the impact he has had, content to play outside and take the more-than-occasional treat from a passer-by.Russell said: \"His favourite thing to do is to go about the hills and mountains. He loves snow too. He likes the isolation of being in the mountains and doing his own thing so when we go walking, I just let him go off ahead.\"He loves pampering, he knows basically hes a bit of a celebrity so when he meets people now he almost expects to get a wee treat or something. I have to rein him in a bit sometimes.\""},{"url":null,"title":"general-election-2019-key-campaign-moments","story":"Week one of the General Election campaign gets under way with Jo Swinson, the soon to be short-lived leader of the Liberal Democrats, claiming that neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn are fit to be Prime Minister. Instead, in a monumental display of hubris, she puts herself forward for the job. Early opinion polls put the Tories ahead of Labour by up to  points.WEEK TWOIn the second week of the campaign Nigel Farage, after seven attempts to win a parliamentary seat, announces he wont make it eight, so as to allow him to campaign nationally for his Brexit Party. Jacob Rees-Mogg, almost omnipresent in the previous weeks, is banished to the outer dark after he says that the Grenfell Tower victims \"lacked common sense\" by staying in the burning building and he jolly well wouldnt haveit was him. This provokes howls of outrage, not just from victims, but from the man fast becoming a national treasure, Stormzy. Polls suggest a narrowing of the Tory lead.WEEK THREEThat lead widens again in week three when Farage, in a crucial ploy to aid Johnson, stands down his candidates in Tory-held seats, reducing the risk of the pro-Brexit vote being split. The floods hit north and southern England, Johnson is heckled when he turns up in wellies in one of them, as is Corbyn, by a Church of Scotland minister in Glasgow, who accuses him of being a terrorist sympathiser.The first sign of Labours main weapon, the NHS, is deployed as figures for AE waiting times in England and Wales are revealed as being at an all-time high. Jo Swinson pledges to revoke Brexit on day oneshe becomes PM by revoking Article . Polls show Tories comfortably  points ahead of Labour.WEEK FOURFor most of week four the election is kicked off the front pages following the car crash interview with Andrew, Duke of York, on a Newsnight special where he denies having sex with the teenage Virginia Roberts, procured by his paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein. In an ITV leaders debate Johnson defends the monarchy as being \"beyond reproach\". Andrew is withdrawn from public duties and vanishes into a black hole with only Rees-Mogg for company, and latterly Labours Diane Abbott.Labour and the LibDems unveil their manestos, with scorn poured on both, Labour promising widespread nationalisation, the LibDems vowing a pound billion Remain bonus to fund the NHS, as well as legalising cannabis. The poll lead is stuck at around  points.WEEK FIVEThe Tories unveil their manesto in week five, including the mantra of \"Get Brexit done\", with a pledge to recruit , more nurses, although it transpires that this includes , existing ones which the PM claims he will dissuade from leaving. A pledge of  new hospitals is whittled down to  and then six, but no one can now tell where reality begins.Jeremy Corbyn is hit by a new row over alleged anti-Semitism when the chief rabbi attacks him in the media.

The father of victim Jack Merritt says his son would not want the incident to be used as a \"pretext\"for draconian sentences and later goes on to call the Prime Minister \"a fraud\".The BBCs Andrew Neil issues an unprecedented primetime challenge to Johnson for failing to appear on his show after all the other party leaders agreed. Johnson also dodges a grilling on ITVs Tonight programme. The Tory poll lead hovers around  points.WEEK SEVENIn the final week of the y campaign Johnson is widely criticised when he refuses to look at a photograph on a reporters mobile phone of a four-year-old boy lying on a Leeds hospital floor due to the lack of beds. He pockets the journalists phone, eventually retrieving it to look at the photograph and apologising.In a Scottish leaders debate Nicola Sturgeon comes under fire from Tories, Labour and LibDems over a further independence referendum.

But theyrsquod tried that unsuccessfully in . This time, the Labour leader somehow managed to be even more unpopular in Scotland than his bumptious Etonian Tory rival. How could that possibly be  Hadnrsquot John McDonnell all but promised a second independence referendum  Arenrsquot Scottish voters supposed to be more left-wing The aversion to Corbyn was mostly down to the national question. But I suspect many Scots shared with Labour voters in England an aversion to Corbynrsquos particular brand of London Labour politics. His sympathy, however justied, with the Palestinian cause, obscure LGBTQIA+ demands and, of course, his views on immigration and defence. It left many patriotic provincial voters uncomfortable.This doesnrsquot mean that socially conservative Labour voters are all homophobes and racists. Polls repeatedly confirm that the vast majority of English, and Scots, voters harbour no ill will towards gay people or racial minorities. But they arenrsquot exactly passionate about transgender toilet arrangements or uncontrolled immigration. And millions voted for BrexitThinly-disguised contempt for working-class Brexit voters was evident throughout the campaign. Labour-friendly comedians like Steve Coogan and Nish Kumar condemned them as ldquoignorant and racist. Did they think they werenrsquot listening Labour activists on Twitter talked about the ldquowhite working class astheyrsquore a lumpen mass of unaddressed bigotry. The Corbynite intellectual, Paul Mason, called the election ldquoa victory of the old over the young, racists over people of colour, selfishness over the planet. Not perhaps the best way to attract back core Labour voters in Blyth, Bolsover, Sedgefield.What middle-class intellectuals failed to understand is that, in post-crash Britain, the politics of nation has largely eclipsed the politics of class. The election results north and south of the Border may appear wildly dferent, but they are both expressions of populist nationalism.Brexit is essentially English nationalism. It is a revolt by people the writer David Goodhart calls the ldquosomewheres, in the provinces, against the remain-voting elites, or ldquoanywheres, in urban centres. ldquoSomewheres feel left out by globalisation, as their jobs have gone abroad and mass immigration has altered their communities.Tories since Disraeli have understood the potency of national identity as a unying force. People who lack the mobility conferred by a university education tend to love their country. They have little  to hold on to in an age of insecurity and rapid change. Get Brexit Done was an English version of Make America Great Again.And though the politics are dferent, Brexit is not so far removed from what happened in Scotland during and after the financial crash. In , the Scottish working classes in the housing estates and inner cities entered politics in unprecedented numbers to vote for independence. The Yes campaign was inspired by feelings of national identity, community and Scotsrsquo love of their country. Plus the hope that an independent Scottish Government would look after them better than remote Westminster.It may be naiumlve, it may be nationalistic, it certainly is populist. But identity is a powerful political mobiliser in an age of insecurity and mistrust. People want to belong, to feel that they are part of something bigger than themselves. National identity gives them that.But the problem with nationalism is that tends to be exclusive. Scotland and England are expressing identity in dferent and contradictory ways ndash the former in a spirit of pro-European internationalism the latter in a more inward-looking, nativist anti-Europeanism. These are irreconcilable opposites.Nicola Sturgeon has often said that she would like to drop the word ldquonational from the SNPrsquos name. She clearly feels uncomfortable with the politics of nationalism, despite having been an SNP supporter all her le. And she has good reason to be wary, given the behaviour of some European nationalist parties.Her task now will be to contain the fervour of her triumphant party and constructively channel their hatred of English conservatism. It wonrsquot be easy. Boris Johnson has provoked the Scots by ruling out any referendum for at least five years. Scotland is about to be dragged kicking and screaming out of Europe.Sturgeon is a cautious politician, unlike her predecessor Alex Salmond, and will not tolerate civil disobedience or unconstitutional behaviour.But like it or not, she has a fight on her hands. A national reckoning is coming."},{"url":null,"title":"Yes  the election was a victory for one nation Conservatism  but the one nation was England","story":"In Scotland, only one Labour seat remains ndash the anti-Corbyn rebel Ian Murray in Edinburgh South.

Blaming BBC bias only made it worse.Of course, Corbynrsquos personality and style of politics was also aturn-off, and the press made a lot of his past associations with IRA supporters and Hamas. But theyrsquod tried that unsuccessfully in . This time, the Labour leader somehow managed to be even more unpopular in Scotland than his bumptious Etonian Tory rival. How could that possibly be  Hadnrsquot John McDonnell all but promised a second independence referendum  Arenrsquot Scottish voters supposed to be more left-wing The aversion to Corbyn was mostly down to the national question. But I suspect many Scots shared with Labour voters in England an aversion to Corbynrsquos particular brand of London Labour politics. His sympathy, however justied, with the Palestinian cause, obscure LGBTQIA+ demands and, of course, his views on immigration and defence. It left many patriotic provincial voters uncomfortable.This doesnrsquot mean that socially conservative Labour voters are all homophobes and racists. Polls repeatedly confirm that the vast majority of English, and Scots, voters harbour no ill will towards gay people or racial minorities. But they arenrsquot exactly passionate about transgender toilet arrangements or uncontrolled immigration. And millions voted for BrexitThinly-disguised contempt for working-class Brexit voters was evident throughout the campaign. Labour-friendly comedians like Steve Coogan and Nish Kumar condemned them as ldquoignorant and racist. Did they think they werenrsquot listening Labour activists on Twitter talked about the ldquowhite working class astheyrsquore a lumpen mass of unaddressed bigotry. The Corbynite intellectual, Paul Mason, called the election ldquoa victory of the old over the young, racists over people of colour, selfishness over the planet. Not perhaps the best way to attract back core Labour voters in Blyth, Bolsover, Sedgefield.What middle-class intellectuals failed to understand is that, in post-crash Britain, the politics of nation has largely eclipsed the politics of class. The election results north and south of the Border may appear wildly dferent, but they are both expressions of populist nationalism.Brexit is essentially English nationalism. It is a revolt by people the writer David Goodhart calls the ldquosomewheres, in the provinces, against the remain-voting elites, or ldquoanywheres, in urban centres. ldquoSomewheres feel left out by globalisation, as their jobs have gone abroad and mass immigration has altered their communities.Tories since Disraeli have understood the potency of national identity as a unying force. People who lack the mobility conferred by a university education tend to love their country. They have little  to hold on to in an age of insecurity and rapid change. Get Brexit Done was an English version of Make America Great Again.And though the politics are dferent, Brexit is not so far removed from what happened in Scotland during and after the financial crash. In , the Scottish working classes in the housing estates and inner cities entered politics in unprecedented numbers to vote for independence. The Yes campaign was inspired by feelings of national identity, community and Scotsrsquo love of their country. Plus the hope that an independent Scottish Government would look after them better than remote Westminster.It may be naiumlve, it may be nationalistic, it certainly is populist. But identity is a powerful political mobiliser in an age of insecurity and mistrust. People want to belong, to feel that they are part of something bigger than themselves. National identity gives them that.But the problem with nationalism is that tends to be exclusive. Scotland and England are expressing identity in dferent and contradictory ways ndash the former in a spirit of pro-European internationalism the latter in a more inward-looking, nativist anti-Europeanism. These are irreconcilable opposites.Nicola Sturgeon has often said that she would like to drop the word ldquonational from the SNPrsquos name. She clearly feels uncomfortable with the politics of nationalism, despite having been an SNP supporter all her le. And she has good reason to be wary, given the behaviour of some European nationalist parties.Her task now will be to contain the fervour of her triumphant party and constructively channel their hatred of English conservatism. It wonrsquot be easy. Boris Johnson has provoked the Scots by ruling out any referendum for at least five years. Scotland is about to be dragged kicking and screaming out of Europe.Sturgeon is a cautious politician, unlike her predecessor Alex Salmond, and will not tolerate civil disobedience or unconstitutional behaviour.But like it or not, she has a fight on her hands. A national reckoning is coming."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-uk-election-others-saw","story":"It has ranged from the casually curious to the colourful and concerned. Irsquom speaking of global reaction to the news of Boris Johnsonrsquos election win these past few days.As the world woke up to a new political landscape across the UK, international press and political responses have proved a telling barometer as to how others see Britainrsquos place in the world and where it might be heading.There were, as might be expected, the usual polite formal messages and notes of congratulation from world leaders to the UKrsquos newly elected prime minister.From German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu among others, the usual expressions of ldquocloser ties and ldquopartnerships were readily forthcoming.But lurking behind these diplomatic courtesies and protocols lie other more signicant clues telling of everything from eager anticipation do downright apprehension. Then there were those of course who simply called it as they saw it.ldquoDespite a dizzying pile of lies, gaffes, insults to blacks, gays, Muslims, workers scattered in his old articles, Boris Johnson has again sprung up, observed one Italian journalist in the countryrsquos daily La Repubblica, under a front page headline \"Europa bye-bye\".As European reactions went, such a negative take was far from unique. Europe after all had a particular interest in the outcome of this election in which the Brexit issue hung like some political Sword of Damocles over the whole affair.Harking back to the story of a pre-War UK newspaper headline that is said to have stated, \"Fog In Channel: Continent Cut Off\", the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter observed that the outcome of the UK election has once again led to fog descending on the Channel, given the still uncertain implications of the next steps in the Brexit process.While acknowledging Johnsonrsquos win and the apparent breakthrough in the Brexit log jam likely to come with it, many global newspapers and politicians were equally quick to recognise that the saga of Britainrsquos place and relationship with its European neighbours is far from over.ldquoItrsquos no secret that personally I wanted the UK to #remain in the #EU, wrote Norbert Rottgen, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the German parliament and a member of the Christian Democratic Union party.ldquoBut the British people have decided  we have to accept their choice: With Johnsonrsquos victory #Brexit has become inevitable. Our goal now has to be to keep relations with the UK as close as possible, Rottgen added in his tweet.Others were less convinced that Johnsonrsquos win would mean business could be conducted as expected. The Spanish daily El Mundo was at pains to point out that the election result ldquowill not decrease the tensions triggered by former Prime Minister David Cameron.ldquoInstead, it has opened new ides between generations, between cities and rural areas, between nationalists and globalists, between pro-Europeans and populists, between people showing solidarity and xenophobic groups, the paper insisted.El Mundo went on to say that despite the absolute majority he has achieved, Johnson would never win a popularity contest in the United Kingdom.ldquoHis success can be attributed ndash beyond those who truly support him ndash to his blunt message: Get Brexit Done ... Only [Jeremy] Corbyn could lose a popularity contest against Boris Johnson, the daily went on.Some Spanish newspapers focused on other issues they saw as vital emerging from the election result, with El Pais concluding that, ldquothe UK is heading for a constitutional clash in Scotland, where the crushing victory of the SNP, which won  of  seats in the region, will further propel the surge for independence.Elsewhere, in its assessment of the election result, El Pais added: ldquoThe nationalist awakening is understandable, because Scotland is opposed to Brexit, and most of its citizens feel that the south is forcing them to abandon the EU against their will.Scotland and the question of another independence referendum not surprisingly resonates among many within Spainrsquos political and press community given the countryrsquos current preoccupation with the Catalonia secessionist issue.This was evidently the case with Spanish lawyer and journalist Joaquim Torra i Pla, known as Quim Torra, who is also a member of the parliament of Catalonia and current president of the Catalan Regional Government.He took the opportunity in the wake of the UK election result to congratulate the Scottish National Partyleader Nicola Sturgeon after she said the Scottish government must be allowed to hold another independence referendum.ldquoCongratulations to the friends of @theSNP and First Minister @NicolaSturgeon for this magnicent result that demonstrates the democratic will for independence and the European commitment of the Scottish people, Torra tweeted.Elsewhere in the Spanish-speaking world the Scottish dimension of the UK election also preoccupied many observers.In far-off Argentina, a country that has just elected a left-wing government under President Alberto Fernandez with support amongst younger voters, the left-wing newspaper Pagina  described Scotland as a ldquocomplex problem for Boris Johnson and drew parallels with the Catalan secessionist issue.ldquoThe problem he has is that the Tories lost seven of the  seats they held in Scotland. The United Kingdom is split in two: nationalist in Scotland, conservative in England. Given that scenario, there is a constitutional crisis ahead, an editorial observed, adding that, ldquoapart from the obvious dferences, the spectre of Catalujnya hovers over this struggle.If the Spanish-speaking world seemed concerned with the Scottish independence issue the French media, who have been following the UK election campaign closely, didnrsquot take long to draw its own conclusions.Indeed as early as last month a front-page headline in the popular tabloid Le Parisien read: ldquoBoris Johnson: the liar weakening Europe.Pulling no punches, the paper called the UK prime minister ldquoEuropersquos bogeyman, a politician for whom ldquopretty much everything is either an empty promise, economical with the truth or a downright lie.Likewise Francersquos Le Monde shared a contempt for Johnsonrsquos election slogan while conceding that it had politically paid off for the Tory leader.ldquoWe like it or we hate it, with its  look, its contempt for details and especially for its slogan lsquoGet Brexit donersquo ndash simplistic and repeated ad nauseam throughout the campaign of the UK general election. For all that, Boris Johnson has masterfully managed his bet, concluded the French daily known for its opinion and analysis pieces.Not everyone of course takes such a negative view of Johnsonrsquos victory. Some Conservative and nationalist leaders in parts of Europe are keen to court the UK prime minister as they see Brexit looming.In Hungary, the right-wing populist Fidesz party of the prime minister, Viktor Orban, was notably quick to congratulate Johnson, with Katalin Novak, the minister for the family, youth and international affairs, tweeting: ldquoConservatives have to become stronger in Europe.Some might argue that Hungaryrsquos brand of conservatism is the last thing the UK needs right now, given that Orban has all but dismantled democracy and virtually turned the country into a one-party state again.Elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe there was similarmore muted recognition of Johnsonrsquos win with Polandrsquos Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki acknowledging what he saw as a ldquofundamental change in the UKrsquos electorate.Meanwhile, as befitting the opaqueness that often characterises the Kremlinrsquos diplomatic response these days, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was not sure whether the Tory win would bring ldquogood relations with Russia, which have been strained in recent years. ldquoI donrsquot know to what extent such expectations are appropriate, said the Kremlin spokesman.By and large ndash apart from a ringing endorsement of Johnson and Brexit by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the head of the Russian nationalist LDPR party ndash the UK election doesnrsquot appear to have been much on the mind of those in Moscow lately, who have pressing political challenges of their own to contend with right now.Peskovrsquos remarks, however, highlight another crucial question the election result has thrown up regarding the international stage, the future of UK foreign policy.As Thomas Raines, Head of the Europe Programme at Chatham House, pointed out last week, ldquoforeign policy may not matter that much to most voters, but these elections matter for foreign policy.On the website of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, he highlighted how the election result will be very influential in shaping Britainrsquos position on the world stage and its approach to international issues. Writing just before the election, Raines contrasted the Labour and Conservative approaches on foreign policy.ldquoOn the one hand, Labour wants to reset and re-orientate Britainrsquos international role based on human rights and international law. It promises a new internationalism and to end what it glibly calls the bomb first, talk later approach, alongside a human rights-driven trade policy, he outlined.By contrast the Conservative manesto, Raines says, ldquoasserts their pride in Britainrsquos historical role in the world, followed by a broad set of largely rhetorical commitments to bolster alliances and expand influence.He points also to an ambitious free trade agenda with the Tories in power and a more economic and commercially driven foreign policy. And therein of course lies the question of relations with the United States, where the administration of president Donald Trump was predictably quick to react positively to Johnsonrsquos victory.ldquoBritain and the United States will now be free to strike a massive new Trade Deal after BREXIT, Trump characteristically tweeted in the early hours of Friday morning.ldquoThis deal has the potential to be far bigger and more lucrative than any deal that could be made with the EU. Celebrate Boris! wrote the US President.Some American commentators agreed, seeing Johnsonrsquos election win as an opportunity for the US and UK to move closer economically. Moreover, according to Newsweek magazine, the result in Britain may also lt Trumps spirit ahead of the  election after Johnsonrsquos ldquounashamedly populistic campaign.That said, many of these same commentators from across the pond recognised too that a strong Conservative majority paradoxically increases the chances of a softer Brexit, which could mean Westminster choosing Brussels over Washington despite Trumps overtures to Johnson.Letrsquos not forget that leaked UK government document produced by the Labour Party during the election campaign that detailed the talks between British and American trade negotiators on reaching a post-Brexit deal.If the details in that document are correct, the US trade representative made clear thatthe UK committed to the EU customs union and single market then a US-UK free trade agreement would be ldquoa non-starter.For now it remains to been seen just what shape relations between the White House and Downing Street will take. It goes without saying, of course, that both Trump and Johnson have much in common, as it seems does their relationship with sections of their respective electorates.Perhaps no overseas commentator summed this up better in the wake of the election than the renowned New York Times columnist and former foreign editor, Roger Cohen.ldquoIn the depressed provinces of institutionalised precariousness, workers embraced an old Etonian mouthing about unleashed British potential. Not a million miles from blue-collar heartland Democrats migrating to Trump the millionaire and America First demagogy, wrote Cohen on FridayldquoThatrsquos the story of Brexit, a national tragedy. Thatrsquos the story of Johnson, the man of no convictions. Thatrsquos the story of Trump, who makes puppets of people through manipulation of outrage and disregard for truth, continued Cohen.ldquoThatrsquos the story of our times. Johnson gets and fits those times better than most. Hersquos a natural.Hersquos right of course, and such astute observations are proof yet again that sometimes it really is invaluable to see ourselves as others see us."},{"url":null,"title":"house-commons-look-proportional-representation","story":"New research by the Electoral Reform Society reveals thatthe UK had used the type of voting system used for the European Parliament elections, there would have been a hung parliament ndash with a possibility Labour could have formed a government with the support of others.Campaigners are continuing to push for voting changes saying that proportional representation is a far more democratic method of electing a government, and helps avoid concerns which surfaced during the long-running Brexit debates that Parliament does not represent the people.Boris Johnson when he moved back to No.  announced he was fronting a \"Peoples Parliament\".:Johnson canrsquot lsquobludgeonrsquo Scotland into his world viewBut the new research reveals that under the dHondt list PR system, the Tories, rather than sweeping to power with a landslide  seats, would be the biggest party with , but that would have been  short of the numbers need to form a majority government.And the SNP would lose out with % of the UK vote, with their seats cut from  to .Critics of the current First Past The Postmethod of electing MPs, say that the latest election continues to underline how it produces \"unrepresentative\" government.In a hung parliament, the incumbent PM stays in office ndash and lives in Downing Street ndash until it is decided who will attempt to form a new government.The Cabinet Manual says that an incumbent government ldquois expected to resignit becomes clear that it is unlikely to be able to command that confidence [of the House of Commons] and there is a clear alternative.That could have allowed Labour to argue that Mr Johnson should quit before a certain datethere is clearly an ldquoanti-Tory majority in the Commons that would inevitably reject his Queenrsquos Speech.Jeremy Corbyn would then have been first in line to have the chance to form a government which would put its Queenrsquos Speech to the Commons to seehe could win the support of a majority of MPs.:Analysis: why Labour lost the electionUnder proportional representation, the Labour Party would have won  seats,  more than our current First Past The Post systemAnd the Liberal Democrats would gain.

Unlike FPTP it cuts out \"wasted\" votes, meaning people were more likely to feel they could support any party at the ballot box and not just those parties who have a chance of winning in a particular seat.The ERS have launched an online petition in support of bringing in a proportional representation system of voting."},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-labour-lost-election","story":"The scattergun of Labourrsquos election policies, while generally approved ofdoubted on their fiscal provenance, proved ineffectual against the stark and simple Tory message of ldquoGet Brexit Done.Labour, it seemed, had learned nothing and forgotten everything. But it was the preication and the switching of positions on Brexit to try to suit all which did it.In June , immediately after the vote to leave the EU, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had pledged: ldquoWe must respect that result and Article  has to be invoked now so that we negotiate an exit from the EU.But then the party swithered and dithered for the best part of three years before coming out with a hopeless, morphed fudge that a Labour government would renegotiate with the EU and put that to the British people.In , in Bill Clintonrsquos successful US presidential campaign, the Democratic strategist James Carville coined the slogan for party workers to keep them focused on the main message: ldquoThe economy, stupid.This is a lesson Labour ignored, while for the Tories their main strategist Isaac Levido came up with the winning one, ldquoGet Brexit done. The -year-old Australian was serenaded by Tory party workers as the TV exit poll predicted a landslide, singing, in a rip-off of Corbynrsquos chorus, ldquoOh Isaac Levido.If we believe the final polls ndash and this time, unlike in , they were accurate ndash then % of Leave voters voted Conservative, a nine-point increase on the previous election, while for Labour there was no good news on either Remain or Leave voters ndash the former were at % support, down five points, and at just %, some nine points down, among Leave voters.This was reflected in Thursdayrsquos vote. The Tory share of the vote rose by six points in seats where more than % had voted Leave, whereas Labourrsquos fell by  points in the most pro-Leave seats.Labourrsquos result, with  seats, is their worst in the post-war period, and somewhat redeems Michael Footrsquos  debacle ndash the manesto then called the so-called longest suicide note in history ndash of  seats. In , the Economist wrote that to find a typical Labour seat one had to look at impoverished inner cites and broken-down towns, but it is just those places, still largely in the same state of disrepair, which have flocked to the Tories in this one. Today that typical Labour bastion would be fervently pro-European, highly-educated mainly in the prosperous south of England in a university town or city.The working class,there still is such a group, has deserted Labour for the Tories in England and the SNP in Scotland. This meltdown has been decades in the cooking. Labour grew from social institutions, most of them centred around the workplace. However, the traditional heavy industries have gone ndash shipbuilding, mining, steel ndash and with them Labourism, the shop stewards, the unions, local organisations. Just about every institution which fostered working-class solidarity has been bulldozed like the Red Wall. In its place have come zero-hours contracts, austerity, child poverty, factories replaced by call centres, fancy memorials put up over holes in the ground where men used to go to work.There was meant to be a transformation of the old into a new, skills-based economy ndash thatrsquos what Labourrsquos Tony Blair government promised. Tell that to the voters of Blyth Valley, which has been Labour since the seat was created in , and was the first shock Tory victory of .Corbyn became the accidental Labour leader ndash he only got on the parliamentary party vote because several of his colleagues lent their votes, not wanting to see him humiliated in the ballot. It was the membership which supported him overwhelmingly, not once but twice.It became a blatant coup attempt, triggered by the sacking of shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn who told Corbyn that he had lost confidence in his leadership. This triggered a mass exodus from the shadow cabinet but, unlike Boris Johnsonrsquos dealing with rebels, the whip was not withdrawn from them and they continued to seethe and plot against him.But the one issue to dog Corbyn was the accusation of institutional anti-Semitism in the party. Margaret Hodge went further and accused him of being a racist and anti-Semite, which baffled anyone who knew him or had followed his parliamentary career.An inquiry set up by Corbyn and chaired by Shami Chakrabarti concluded that the party was not overrun by racists, but the report was widely criticised for its softly-softly approach and the issue continued to run right through to the election, with the Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis resuscitating it almost on the eve of poll.The right-wing press also carried out a relentless vilication of Corbyn, from anti-Semitism to accusing him of having terrorist sympathies and being a security threat, to being an anti-royalist and republican because he said he watched the Queenrsquos Christmas message in the morning, when it is actually in the afternoon. Corbynrsquos predecessor, Ed Miliband, had been mocked over his eating of a bacon sandwich, his brother David, and rival for the party leadership, had been pilloried for the way he held a banana, but the war on Corbyn was relentless and unprecedented.One of the lessons Labour should have learned, apart from the right way to grasp fruit, the most prescient one, was to look beyond the Red Wall and Hadrianrsquos Wall to Scotland, and how the formerly hegemonic party had collapsed in the country.Arrogance in power, failing to respond to the needs of its base communities, had provoked the backlash, and a switch not to the Tories, but to the Scottish National Party and around independence rather than Brexit.Labourrsquos shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, conceded that in some of the partyrsquos banker seats, ldquoa long history of maybe  years of neglect had seen them fall. In , the SNP held two seats in Scotland. Now they have , the majority, overwhelmingly, in what were once considered safe Labour seats.The revival may have started in the Highlands but it spread quickly to the central belt and urban areas, to the poor and deprived who were once Labourrsquos backbone.Now, just one MP remains, Ian Murray in Edinburgh South, a relatively prosperous constituency. Murray has been an outspoken opponent of Corbyn and described his leader as ldquotoxic on the doorsteps, a view that was widely held in the seats in England the party lost.This was, like it or not, a vote about nationalism. In Northern Ireland there was a nationalist majority, as there was in Scotland, and in England ndash despite the overall vote apparently splitting % to % for Remain parties ndash in the ones that counted, the marginals, the former Red Wall, it was overwhelmingly the case.Labourrsquos failure was to ignore the evidence on the ground, to confront English nationalism, and by attempting to appease its parliamentary Remainers, betraying the verdict of the electorate and its core support.Corbynrsquos failures were manold. He may have been unfairly pilloried but he lacked clear and decisive leadership, epitomised by saying he would remain neutral in a forthcoming ballot on Brexit, leaving the rest of the country to mock him over what wasnrsquot just unlikely, but a vanished possibility."},{"url":null,"title":"tories-must-drop-indyref-obsession-2021-elections","story":"That was the advice from a senior Scots academic, who said that the Conservatives campaign in Scotland focused on blocking a second independence referendum while failing to appeal to other voters on any other meaningful issues.Others have predicted a \"bleak\" outcome for both Labour and the LibDems unless they take \"drastic\" action to change their appearance and appeal to the electorate.Following the chaos of the latest General Election, political parties will already be analysing how the results can help inform their campaign going into the Holyrood poll in  months time, with lessons to be learned on all sides.Experts say that while Labour debates how to reinvigorate their support, the LibDems work out where they went wrong and the SNP decide how to push through a second referendum or hide any governmental failings, the Tories must rethink their campaign entirely.Dr Malcolm Harvey a lecturer in Politics and International Relations at the University of Aberdeen, said: \"The Conservatives massively played the lsquono to indyrefrsquo card in Scotland.\"Im based in Aberdeenshire, and largely in the north-east of Scotland independence was a big issue. They held most of their seats up here.\"You would drive past fields with big signs showing the Tory candidate, with no to Indyref.

By the time  comes around the SNP will have been in government for  years, and they donrsquot have a good record of government, largely speaking, in this time but none of the other parties really look like an alternative government.\"Labour got an absolute shellacking in the General Election this time, the Conservatives at Holyrood ... If you had their Westminster MPs, they would look more like a potential government than some of the ones who are now in Holyrood right now. Can they now move up to that level \"If the SNP can get to  seats, I think that would put more pressure on the constitutional question. All Boris Johnson has to say is lsquoNo, yoursquore not having a referendumrsquo.\"Some people from the SNP are talking about legal options but I donrsquot know what those legal options are. It is quite clear that the constitution is a reserved issue, and is at the behest of the UK Government.\"We had a referendum in  because of an agreement, because David Cameron was pretty sure he would win. There is no guarantee this time, and it would seem like a huge risk to take.\"Harvey said that during the first few terms of the Scottish Parliament, constituencies tended to vote the same way in the Holyrood and Westminster elections, but when the SNP won a majority in , everything changed.He said: \"The thing they traded on between  and  was lsquolook at our record in governmentrsquo and they got a majority in  on the back of that. They canrsquot do that now because their record in government doesnrsquot stack up all that well.\"If you fast forward to , when the SNP won  of  seats in Westminster, that has its routes in  but also a direct result of the independence referendum.\"In some ways this election now is even more impressive. Yes, the SNP did not get as many seats and they are  per cent down on the share of their votes than , but its more impressive because they have been in government for longer.\"They have a record to defend and a record,yoursquore being honest about it, that doesnrsquot look particularly good.\"Research has suggested that in Scotland, the Scottish government tend to get the credit for something good happening irrespective of whether the Scottish parliament had the npower over it or not. If it was something good Westminster had done, the Scottish government got the credit. If there was blamed to be assigned, eventhe Scottish parliament had the power over this, Westminster still got the blame for it. That has largely held through  years of devolution.\"The SNP massively benefit from that because it plays in to their sort of grievance politics. That is part of their selling point, that Westminster is the bogey man, Scotland is disadvantaged, lsquoWe are trying to do all these good things and they are holding us backrsquo.\"Rob Johns, politics professor at the University of Essex, said the Scottish parliament elections have apparently fallen in line with the UK elections in terms of becoming a two-party race, exaggerated by the support for and against independence.He explained: \"The really interesting feature for Scottish politics is the two party-fication of it.\"For the longest period there were three,not fouryou count the LibDems, signicant players, we would always put four parties on the graph.\"But increasingly it looks asthere is a move towards a standard two-party system, a bit like in England, but the SNP is now the Labour party, but a much more successful version of it.\"Johns added that the proportional representation in Scotland, compared with the first-past-the-post system in the UK elections, has not played a role in lessening the move towards a two-party contest.He said: \"Somebody could say in the Scottish elections it will be dferent due to proportional representation, there isnrsquot a pressure for tactical voting. It seems to me that this two-party tendency we have now is psychological, itrsquos not just tactical or to do with the electoral system.\"People are just becoming polarised on the independence issue, obviously, and I think it is going to be a bleak night in May  for both Labour and the LibDems unless they can do something pretty drastic.

As a result, he does not think Mr Johnson is sincere. ldquoEach and every one of the prime ministerrsquos predecessors, remember, made similarly heartwarming speeches on the steps of No  about healing a ided country, only to walk through its shiny black door and proceed to do pretty much the opposite.Elsewhere there is even less sign of rts healing.

Brexit,not lsquodonersquo, is certainly now decided. The government will do what the people asked it to do nearly four years ago, and leave the EU. Thatrsquos good: I voted Remain, but I lost, and in a democracy, you must allow the winners to win.How do we relate that concept of the mandate, of democracy, to Scotland and to independence  That is the question which we will now wrestle with as Scots over the next  months, and quite probably for years thereafter, with the attention of the UK and the world on us.:Mark Smith: Inside the minds of the unionists who voted SNP ndash and what it means for The discussion has begun it began at .pm on Thursday night after the exit poll predicted another surge towards the SNP. Inevitably, the SNP claimed a mandate for indyref. It was the fourth time such a mandate had been claimed since the  independence referendum. The first was in , after the SNPrsquos -seat landslide the second was in June , after the UKrsquos Brexit vote fulfilled the SNPrsquos manesto criteria of Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will the third was after the party won the  General Election, and this was the fourth.Opposing, the Tories, of course, claimed that no such mandate exists. They cite ious reasons, principally that in this election many SNP candidates expressly said a vote for them was not a vote for indyref and that the SNPrsquos campaign slogan was lsquoStop Brexitrsquo, as well as the old favourite, that the  independence referendum was claimed by the SNP at the time to be lsquoonce in a generationrsquo.The reality, political and democratic, lies somewhere in between these competing claims. The strongest of all the SNPrsquos claimed mandates is, in fact, the one which emanated from the combination of the  Holyrood election and the Brexit referendum. The manesto called for a second referendum in the event of certain circumstances and specically cited the circumstance of the UK voting to leave the EU with Scotland voting to remain.I take the view that this qualies as a mandate, but I accept that it is not so clear as to be inarguable. It was by definition caveated, and its electoral endorsement is partly tied to a contorted pledge in the Green manesto which, as far as it is understandable, has probably not been met.The Tories, too, have a point. Whilst their lsquoonce in a generation argumentrsquo is bogusthe argument that last Thursdayrsquos election does not constitute a specic mandate is solid.The voting patterns in Scotland were quite clear - the Tory vote stayed relatively solid and the collapsing Labour vote went primarily to the SNP, and to a degree to the Lib Dems, both on the basis of Brexit. This was a Brexit election in Scotland just as it was in England, and that was the key driver for voters with pencil in hand.A sensible discussion between Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon could bring common ground and common sense to the frenzy. Sturgeon should find it easy to accept that there will be no referendum in , mainly because it is an open secret that she and her team do not actually want a referendum next year, with their pro-independence polling numbers looking far weaker than they had expected them to, given the perfect storm of Boris and Brexit.:Nicola Sturgeon takes constitutional fight to Boris Johnson with SNP pledge to do absolutely everything to secure  voteSimilarly, Johnson, fresh off a campaign which was based on upholding democracy by lsquogetting Brexit donersquo as the people had asked, should be able to relate to a clear indyref mandate emerging from an election in which it will be the main issue.This all points to the  Scottish Parliament election - the most important there has ever been. That election will be fought on very clear ground, with very likely no room for debate on anything other than indyref. If the SNP wins that election with a clear manesto commitment for a second vote, a full two parliamentary terms after their first win, there can be no serious grounds to oppose it.You canrsquot be a fair-weather democrat. You canrsquot demand to get Brexit done because voters asked for it whilst demanding that indyref is continually rejected despite voters asking for it.For Johnson to concede this point, the Scottish Tories will need to play a key role, and their position over the coming months will be worth analysing. Although under the circumstances, they ed a creditable result last Thursday, they should not allow it to paper over the cracks which are clearly there.The Tory strategy ndash no to indyref ndash was designed to expand its vote by encouraging Labour unionists to lend their vote to the Tories. That strategy crashed and burned on Thursday. Are the Tories, who have become institutionally obsessed with indyref, nimble enough to reflect upon the fact that they may have maximised that ultra-Unionist vote  I am not so sure.A subtle change in position could help them, whilst also providing them with a more credible, democratic position on indyref to match the credible, democratic position they have held on Brexit.Their position has been lsquovote for us and we will stop indyrefrsquo they should alter it ahead of  to lsquovote for us or we will not be able to stop indyrefrsquo. In other words, the party should acknowledge that a mandate in  will have to be respected, and there will have to be another independence referendum, soyou donrsquot want one then you had better vote Tory.This change in strategy would serve three purposes. Firstly, it would incentivise the core vote in just as compelling a way as the current strategy - frankly, itrsquos not as though they are going to vote for anyone . Secondly, it would respect democracy, and in times such as these, that would be a noble act. Thirdly, and most importantly, it would be a departure of the tired, old, failed Tory strategy of the last  years, which in the final analysis has always been: say no to Scotland.Not for the first time in Scottish Tory history, they are struggling to see that this is failing, and is simply pushing people away from the Union and towards independence.The irony of all of this is that the Nationalistsrsquo strength is over-estimated by Unionists, who have become so paranoid about indyref that they seem blind to the fundamentals which are in place, and which may allow the unionists to record a larger win than last time, closing the book on independence just like they closed the book on Brexit.All they have to do is smarten up.

Admittedly, the First Minister did say that not everyone who voted SNP supported independence, but she also said her partyrsquos success provided a renewed, refreshed and strengthened mandate for a new Scottish referendum.This did not please the SNP-voting unionists I spoke to, even though they knew it was likely to happen. One said to me that Ms Sturgeonrsquos use of the election result was cynical and had made her less likely to vote SNP a second time. It might also have helpedthe First Minister had acknowledged the subtleties, nuances and conflicting emotions that led Scottish voters to act in ways they never had before, rather than rushing to claim a mandate for a second referendum.Weirdly ndash because hersquos anything but subtle ndash Boris Johnson actually did a better job of talking about this phenomenon of ldquolent votes. He could have sounded triumphalist he could have clenched his fists and cheered at the defeat of Labour candidates in traditionally Labour areas.But instead he said that he recognised some votersrsquo hands might have ldquoquivered before they put their cross in the Conservative box. He also said he knew that many of those voters probably intended to vote Labour next time round. Rather than claiming the voters as Tories, it was an acknowledgement of what was actually going on with some people, and Nicola Sturgeon should have done something similar in a lot more detail and with a lot more humility.:Nicola Sturgeon takes constitutional fight to Boris Johnson with SNP pledge to do absolutely everything to secure  voteMs Sturgeon and her advisors should also be cautious about what they take from this for the future. As my SNP-voting unionists explained, they voted the way they did in the general election mostly because they felt they had no choice. They were in constituencies where, because of the first-past-the-post system, voting SNP was the only way to maximise the chances of thwarting the Tory and voting against Brexit. Truthfully, they would rather have voted Labour or LibDem and in a proportional system, they would have done. But instead, because of the system we have and with Brexit as the main concern, reluctantly, fretfully, and with a heavy heart, they voted SNP.Obviously, the same rules will not apply when the  Scottish general election comes round: under proportional representation, voters will be free to vote for a party they believe in. This means many of those who voted SNP in  because of Brexit and Boris will revert to their previous choices in , not only because Brexit will presumably no longer be the issue it once was but because voters will understand that independence really will be on the ballot in  and therersquoll be no question about how their vote will be used by the SNP.Not everyone will behave in the same way of course. One of the voters I spoke to, a man who voted No in  and SNP this year, said he wouldnrsquot rule out supporting a future independence referendumit was the lesser of two evils.However, for other unionists who have just voted SNP, the  Scottish election will be a chance to vote against independence just as the  UK election was their chance to vote against Brexit. What this means is that, far from being the beginning of a surge for the SNP, the election wersquove just been through could be a high tide. Maybe the First Minister gets this. Maybe she realises some of the votes she won last week are only on loan. And maybe she should think about it a bit more before she clenches her fists in triumph."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc-consciously-played-part-labours-general-election-defeat-claims-mp","story":"Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald made the claims during an interview on BBC Radio rsquos Today programme.It came as the partyrsquos leadership battle descended into acrimony with Jeremy Corbyn facing renewed criticism and one of his key allies being accused of calling voters ldquostupid.Presenter Justin Webb asked Mr McDonald about Labourrsquos heavy losses and whether the partyrsquos leader played a part in that.Mr McDonald said: ldquoDonrsquot get me started on the media, Justin.

It means less energy and less space is needed to treat a higher quantity of waste water, reducing the operating costs of the site. It also removes the need to chemically treat the effluent, increasing the protection of the rivers Don and Urie, and provides the capacity to support the local community as it continues to grow and flourish. The project was delivered by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD and included building new sewer pipework, improving the resilience of the site to flooding and upgrading existing equipment. Ms Gougeon said: “While treating waste water isn’t something people probably like to think about too often, it is something that is absolutely vital to protect not only our health and sanitation, but also the environment. “Developing new, more efficient ways of treating waste water through the deployment of new technology, is hugely important as Scotland takes decisive steps towards tackling the climate emergency we are facing around the world.” Chief Executive of Scottish Water Douglas Millican said: “We are always looking for ways to innovate and protect the environment both locally and globally, so it is very exciting to see this new state-of-the-art treatment works officially opened here in Inverurie – the first of its kind in Scotland. “Not only does it mean we can continue to treat waste water effectively and protect the environment for years to come, it also underlines our commitment to pursue new ways to lower our energy requirements, towards reaching our ambitious goal of achieving net zero emissions by .” Most construction work on site was completed in the Spring and the new treatment process has since been closely monitored during commissioning and beyond.While most of the work took place within the established Scottish Water site, installation of new pipework beneath the railway line involved a closure to Keithhall Road which was completed ahead of schedule in April .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A group of Logie Durno Primary School pupils taking part in the Wee Sleep Out\"  Wee Sleep Out at Logie Durno School viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"ESD Chief Operating Officer Wendy Cooper said: “We are very proud of what has been achieved at Inverurie, successfully delivering a cutting edge new wastewater treatment technology in Scotland for the first time. “Success in this project has involved close collaboration between Scottish Water, ESD, Royal HaskoningDHV and our wider supply chain.

Those talks are critical to the future of our industry.“It is these negotiations that will be the real bread and butter of Brexit for NFU Scotland members. That is where the terms of the trade deal between the UK and the EU will be agreed.“For NFUS, ensuring as free and as frictionless trade in agri-food goods with the EU, which remains our principal market outside of the UK, has been our priority from the start of this process.“Whether negotiating with the EU, or establishing new trade deals with other countries worldwide, a red line for us is that Scotland’s high standards must be recognised and protected.“Our members can be reassured that their union has begun engagement with this new parliament today and we will make tracks to Westminster at the earliest opportunity as we enter a new era for Scottish farming and crofting.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Smales said: “We’re delighted to be able to bring one of our hi-tech taps to Kirkwall, rounding off our first full year of installing Top up Taps across Scotland.#We want to make it easier for Orcadians and visitors to stay hydrated on the go and enjoy our great tasting water whenever they are out and about.“We’re encouraging everybody to top up from the tap as much as possible and get into the habit of carrying a refillable bottle with them when they leave the house. As well as the health benefits of drinking more water, it also saves you money and helps reduce waste.”Since the first tap was launched in Edinburgh in October , more than , litres of water has been drunk from Scottish Water’s expanding collection of Top Up Taps — the equivalent of , standard ml single-use plastic bottles.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He stood as an independent candidate in the  General Election, receiving  votes — despite making previous comments to The Orcadian that the election was #illegal#.But SIC has said that placards erected in Shetland by Mr Hill were #unauthorised#, in that he had not sought prior approval before erecting them.In a press release issued on behalf of the #Sovereign Nation of Shetland#, Mr Hill claimed that the SIC roads department had carried out its #threat# to remove his election signs — which he believes it had no authority to do.He said: “Apparently the left hand doesn#t know what the right hand is doing and neither has the authority to do anything. This is just a strong arm tactic from those who want our message suppressed.#It has long been customary to put up signs on lamp posts at election time and when I was a candidate, no permission was asked and no objections were made. As for not being a candidate – that is nonsense.#I have a message just as valid as any candidate for those wanting to make a legitimate protest vote about the £ million Shetland and Orkney pay to the UK every year for nothing in . Rather than vote in an MP, who can do nothing about it, people should write NO THANX across the ballot paper to keep the power here. All spoiled papers are counted.#The SIC did not have the authority to take down my signs. I will be charging them for doing so. Supporters have rallied round and new ones will be printed and re-erected today. We will not be bullied by those who do not like our message.”Responding to Mr Hill#s comments, a spokeswoman from SIC said:#The road service of the council is in communication with Mr Hill over the matter of unauthorised placards, but we will not publicly comment at this point.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile in Scotland, the SNP’s result was arguably even more remarkable with the party securing  out of  seats. Not quite , but still that means  per cent of Scotland’s MPs are Nationalists.However, their result was achieved on the basis of  per cent of the vote in Scotland and the Tories won . across the UK, so both these ‘majorities’ are actually based on ‘minorities’ and a product of the first-past-the-post system.Amid their understandably triumphant celebrations, Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon now appear to be on a political collision course over a second independence referendum, a bitter and isive constitutional clash of epic proportions.: Jackson Carlaw promises Scottish unionists: We can still stop indyref: Nicola Sturgeon: Indyref is ‘democratic right of the Scottish people’However, they could attempt to take a dferent course, one of humility and respect for the dferent viewpoints of these two political tribes.As he ed to  Downing Street, Boris Johnson said the UK “deserves a break from wrangling, a break from politics”, adding: “I urge everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin.”And he is right about the need for healing. The UK is still ided along Leave Remain lines while, for all Johnson and fellow unionists might wish it to be so, the large number of people who support Scottish independence are unlikely to simply give up. And there are other signicant ides in the UK – between left and right, with newly enthused activists on both sides of the spectrum young and old urban and rural areas north and south – that are problems for our society.Rule by London diktatThe key questions are whether Johnson is serious about trying to heal the country or whether this is rhetoric in preparation for the looming fight with the SNP andSturgeon actually has an interest in joining in such a process, rather than stoking ision as part of efforts to secure independence.ButScotland does ever leave the UK, it is most assuredly in its interests to maintain good relations with its nearest and dearest neighbour, just as it is in the UK’s interests to maintain good relations with the EU. Indeed, this would almost certainly be vital to making a success of an independent Scotland. So it would be a mistake for the SNP to dismiss Johnson’s victory and his pledge to stop a second referendum. Political promises should be hard to break, particularly for a Prime Minister with a reputation for being, perhaps, too ‘economical with the actualité’.And, likewise, it would be a mistake for Johnson to add to the sense of nationalist grievance by acting in a high-handed way that could be portrayed as rule by London diktat.They may not like it, in fact, they may absolutely hate it, but they might be better advised to seek some form of compromise, to find an acceptable middle ground.Quite what that would be is hard to say. But it could be more powers for Scotland or perhaps an agreement to allow a second indyrefthe SNP wins the next Holyrood election. Some commentators believe it would be politically untenable to deny a second voteSturgeon wins in that is the case, it might make more sense for Johnson to allow it and focus on ensuring an SNP defeat, rather than rail against it, only to later concede.Smart politics is not always about being tough. There are powerful forces that could easily push them into an increasingly bitter conflict but, surely, in the long run, that would be in no one’s interest.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

But I’d guess the overwhelming majority is now open to another referendum – as are once-sceptical players like Scottish business, the British media, international opinion and progressive English voters.I’d also guess many Scots are unimpressed by the sour unionist response to Nicola Sturgeon’s success. The SNP and Tories do currently benefit from the polarising distortion of first-past-the-post voting . But the Tories are hanging on to that indefensible system for dear le whilst the SNP has long campaigned for PR – even though it would give them fewer Westminster seats. The Electoral Reform Society suggests the European d’Hondt system of PR , would have given Labour an extra  seats, the Lib Dems , the Brexit Party  and the Greens another , producing a clear anti-Brexit majority at UK level. No wonder the Tories stick with FPTP. Butthey live by it in England, they should lose by it in Scotland, with a little more dignity. As for slogans on buses – really  Last week the Tories slapped “ hours to save theUnion” beside “Vote Conservative to stop Indyref” on buses, fences, posters and leaflets. Both propositions were roundly rejected. So, let’s not quibble.If the will of the English electorate is discerned by the allocation of seats, the verdict of the Scottish electorate must be understood in the very same way. And that’s fairly clear: No Brexit, No Tories and Yes to self-determination.Scottish unionist parties must now decide whether to change tack. So far, banging the Union drum has been their shared response, but continuing to insist that nothing much has changed will not help a pulverised Scottish Labour.Nicola Sturgeon will publish her case for transferring Section  powers to the Scottish Parliament this week. Fortunately for Richard “I see no ships” Leonard there will be no vote, but he must still support or oppose the First Minister’s position. Which will it be  In January, Boris Johnson’s Withdrawal Bill will come before Holyrood for approval. Will Scottish Labour join the SNP and Greens in opposing it – or abstain  These are just the first tests of political courage facing the Scottish wings of unionism in . The election result must also prompt an end to the weariness demonstrated by many newspapers and parts of BBC Scotland about our constitutional impasse. EU leaders could help by scotching the hoary old myth that an independent Scotland would face problems joining the EU. When the Withdrawal Bill is passed, there will be nothing to stop heavyweights like Michel Barnier assuring Scots of speedy EU welcome. Reaching out would also reflect the rising tide of pro-Scottish sentiment across EU member states, where understanding of Scotland’s democratic dilemma has been transformed by Brexit, the articulate, consistent advocacy of social democracy by Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP’s evident ability to resist the “Blue Wave”. Such is the respect for Nicola Sturgeon across Britain and Europe that she doubtless tops the wish-list for replacing Jeremy Corbyn.But the SNP are far from perfect. They are human beings and politicians – fallible and capable of playing hardballwhen they deem it necessary. To date the fiercest critics of the SNP leadership have left those doors firmly closed. Alex Salmond may be the first to open them when his court case begins in March.So, Sturgeon will also be thoroughly tested in the tough year that lies ahead. First, there’s a need to reconnect with the re-energised Yes movement and jettison the “SNP only” mode of thinking and behaviour that necessarily kicks in during election campaigns. All Under One Banner has already organised a pro-independence march for  January in Glasgow. It would be greatSturgeon could address that rally and organisers can create the conditions to make that possible. Second, the response to Boris Johnson must be spirited and consistent. There’s no going out of top gear during . At Westminster, the SNP has essentially become the opposition – the only party with the leader, mandate, moral authority and parliamentary skillset to challenge the Tories on a range of subjects. Nonetheless the primary purpose of SNP MPs must be to contrast Scotland’s shabby Brexit experience with the generous opt-out being devised for Northern Ireland.The dferent treatment of the two Remain-voting Celtic cousins will become even more pronouncedStormont is reconstituted with a nationalist majority and can thus trigger a border poll on Irish reunication, safe in the knowledge that the exercise can be repeated within seven years,unsuccessful. SNP MPs must find ways to showcase Scotland’s unacceptable Brexit dilemma, whilst ignoring inevitable Conservative fury for failing to knuckle down and shut up.Thirdly, the SNP at Holyrood must start to heed progressive ideas about improved performance of the day job, prepare a new Brexit-focused independence strategy, defend Holyrood against the likely erosion of powers, anticipate the impact of cash handouts to Scottish councils and communities by Johnson which will bypass and undermine the Scottish Parliament, and start rolling out the Green Deal to combat climate change.Without ever sounding presumptuous, without resorting to bland assertion over calm persuasion, without taking the easiest over the fairest route, Sturgeon must inch forward throughout , demanding the right for Scots to end their “imprisonment” within a Tory, Brexiting UK – and all before the transition period ends. will be a dramatic year. Of course, democracy means people are free to change their minds. But it looks like the blip in Scotland’s recent voting history was the  snap election, not the  seats won by the SNP two years earlier. If the choice for Scottish voters is Brexit Britain versus a new start in Europe,it’s Sturgeon versus Johnson,it’s the Scottish Parliament versus Westminster, then  will surely be a turning point for Scotland, whether there’s an independence referendum, or just the slow build towards a probable SNP landslide in . ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited.

Trees decorated or sponsored by local people, churches, organisations and businesses will delight , while musicians and singers will play live Christmas music on the hour. Take a seat, close your eyes, pray and invite God to bring you into not ‘that Christmassy feeling’ but the deep joy that comes from knowing Him through Jesus Christ.There will be a number of points where guets can interact with the trees – for instance add to the decorations of a tree with your own words of joy and thanksgiving, post prayer requests for personal needs and other situations around the world at the Prayer Tree, and use the Blue Christmas ‘remembering’ tree to remember those whose presence we miss due to distance or death. A Kids’ Craft room will be open for children to take some time to also engage with the theme of Christmas Joy.When you’ve spent some time taking in the Christmas forest, head through the link corridor to the new hall, where hot drinks and festive treats will be served. Viewing of the trees and enjoying refreshments can take place on Friday pm-pm, Saturday am-.pm and Sunday pm-pm. The suggested donation for entrance is £and gts will be gratefully received.Rev.

As their parents leave for a dinner party they are left under the care of a stern Nanny Cooksonwho leaves open the children’s bedroom window as Peter Pan and loyal sidekick Tinkerbell ask the Darling’s to come to Neverland. It’s here that the magic of theatre really packs a punch as our actors fly through the London skyline and past the chimes of Big Ben.Vibrant colours, giant flowers, and an introduction to Tiger Lilly mark our arrival in Neverland as the adventure unfolds for our characters.The interval climax is a trio of glistening, sparkly mermaids whose ‘Queen Bah-Ree’ can hit the high notes that Mariah Carey would be proud of and is played to the hilt by Alan Richardson.Allison Harding makes for a superb, villainous Captain ‘Jess’ Hook and is matched perfectly with Christina Nelson’s Miss Smee.Michael Mahoney plays our hero with cracking energy and at times vulnerability as he leads his Lost Boys and the Darling children to safety after defeating his nemesis aboard the Jolly Roger.The five and eight-year-old we had with us for the performance were sat bolt right up from the opening scenes and were still wondering how Peter, Wendy and the Darling children were able to fly before they turned in for bed later that night.Families and children of all ages, including two almost -year-olds loved this adaptation from start to finish, with memorable songs, stunning effects, costumes and even a giant crocodile for good measure.Catch the magic over the Christmas period.Peter Pan runs at the Lyric Theatre until January .

The striking piece was commissioned by go-to Andersonstown physiotherapist Dan Turley, taking pride of place in his home.Meabha, originally from Inishmore Crescent, now based across the water, told the Andersonstown News that her interest and talent in art flourished ever since “I could hold a crayon”.“In our household, thankfully, you were allowed to be who and what you were. I passed my -Plus and wanted to go to the school around the corner and that was St Genevieve’s. I had always had a love of painting and came from an artistic, creative family.”Friends since they were teenagers, Dan commissioned Meabha, who has displayed her work at the annual Féile an Phobail artists showcase in St Mary’s University College, to create Mná hÉireann.“My biggest problem was finding the right face, the central figure in this case of the piece, to signy le force and strength. I had painted a portrait of Clannad’s Moya Brennan before and I just kept coming back to her face, especially with her being a Celtic woman, a setter of pace. I did change it slightly, the hair, the colour of the eyes, I wanted to convey the feel of her, not necessarily a repeat portrait,” she said.She continued: “I’ve known Dan since I was , we have a lot of banter. He’s a Michelangelo man and just to annoy him I painted the ‘Da Vinci rose’ in it,” she laughed. “There are forget-me-nots in the painting and fuschias, deora Dé God’s tears, as I’d imagine he’d cry to see the persecution women have and continue to face at the injustices in the world.“Dan was very clear that he wanted only positives in the piece, no negatives.”Contained in Mná hÉireann are leaves of ious sizes withnames on them of women from throughout history in delicate gold lettering, and not immediately obvious.“I spent time researching and wanted to go beyond the obvious,” explained Meabha. “Countess Markievicz is there, my great aunt Nano Mullan is on it who fought alongside Countess Markievicz, Sonia O’Sullivan is there. The names are quite hard to read and that was deliberate, as throughout history women haven’t always been seen. They’ve had to come through back doors, pretend to be less than they were.”The prolic artist said the painting and the names contained in it have proved quite the talking point.“James Barry is on it. A woman who wanted to join the Irish army as a military surgeon and disguised herself as a man to do.”James Barry became a pioneering surgeon who carried out the first successful Caesarean delivery.Meabha spoke of how “not all the contributions, the names are immediately obvious”.“Sinéad Burke is there, Sinéad who is three-and-a-half foot tall, a Dublin-based teacher, PhD student and activist. When I first read about her, I nearly skimmed past the article, which was about the fashion industry. I love style but have no interest in fashion. I soon realised the article wasn’t about fashion in that sense, it was about inclusion – a much bigger topic and much more far reaching in many areas of le.“There are olives painted in the portrait, in dferent stages of development which are symbolizing peace. Some are ripe, some aren’t, the meaning behind this is that this is an ongoing stage, peace is a circle of work that will never end, we are always going to have to work hard for it.“I’m glad that the painting is proving to be such a talking point in Dan’s house. It’s as much about learning in that you pick a name and find out more, there is meaning behind each chosen colour, flower and there are emeralds, in this particular case placed in the Celtic crown to represent the four green fields.“The ring formation of the wreath signies everlasting protection. I didn’t want to follow the trend of portraying a warrior queen, that has been well covered by many fabulous artists. I wanted to make this piece more personal.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"voters go to polls for westminster election","story":"POLLING stations have opened across the North in the General Election. candidates are competing for  Westminster seats.Polling stations opened at am and will close at pm with results expected to be finalised early on Friday morning.A total of ,, people are eligible to vote across the north.North Belfast is expected to witness one of the tightest contests, between DUP’s Nigel Dodds and Sinn Féin’s John Finucane, with Nuala McAllister of Alliance the other candidate on the ballot paper.In South Belfast, SDLP’s Claire Hanna is the bookies favourite to oust outgoing DUP MP Emma Little-Pengelly.

The group faced a backlash after a New IRA gunman shot and killed journalist Lyra McKee in Londonderry in April.The annual memorial service was condemned by Newry and Armagh DUP MLA William Irwin, who said Grant and Quinns actions should not be \"gloried nor celebrated\".\"An -year-old innocent lad lost his le in this explosion and more than  were injured,\" he added.\"It was Christmas Eve. Only a warped person would plant a bomb in a bar on any day of the year but it takes a really wicked and depraved character to plant a bomb on Christmas Eve. \"This bomb did not target soldiers. It targeted families doing their Christmas shopping.

When askedpolitics is more dficult for women, she told this newspaper: \"Im not a feminist, but I think women have to work doubly hard to prove themselves.\"It can be dficult juggling a family le with politics but,youre capable of doing the job, just get on with it.\"*Carla Lockhart was contacted for interview yesterday, but could not be reached.Carla LockhartDUPUpper BannWon by: , votesBrexit: LeaveFresh face Finucane in North Belfast faces tough task as abstentionist\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Sinn Fein’s John Finucane celebrates with party leader Mary Lou McDonald, left, and deputy leader Michelle O’Neill after winning in the Belfast North constituency  The span of his political career may be short, but high profile lawyer John Finucanes rise within Sinn Fein has been nothing short of outstanding, and his election win cements his status as the partys rising star.The -year-olds career as MP for North Belfast - in what has been a historic victory for Sinn Fein which saw the unseating of the DUPs Nigel Dodds - begins at the same age his father, human rights lawyer Pat Finucane, was killed by loyalist gunmen in their home in .John Finucane was aged just eight.The son of a working-class father from the Falls and a middle-class Protestant mother from east Belfast, Mr Finucane has dedicated his adult years to campaigning for a public inquiry into his fathers murder.In  he stood for the first time against Mr Dodds in North Belfast, and lost.Undeterred, he switched to council politics, standing in the local elections earlier this year - which saw him winning a seat on Belfast City Council.His career as a councillor had barely begun when he was appointed in May as the Lord Mayor of Belfast - a role which saw him pledge that he would represent everyone, including unionists.Those words were swtly put into practice when he welcomed Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall in what was his first official mayoral engagement.The appointment also saw the father-of-four juggle the demands of family le with mayoral duties along with representing boxer Carl Frampton in the courtroom in the sportsmans very public battle against former manager, Barry McGuigan.In a previous interview he also spoke of managing his packed schedule to ensure he still found time for his beloved GAA club, playing goalkeeper and captain for Lamh Dhearg.Now the Belfast man once again finds himself pledging to represent everyone in a constituency which until yesterday had been in the hands of Mr Dodds for nearly  years - a challenge he faces as an abstentionist MP.*John Finucane was contacted for interview yesterday but could not be reached.John FinucaneSinn FeinNorth BelfastWon by: , votesBrexit: RemainFarry back to his old stomping ground after upsetting odds\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry secured his party’sto the House of Commons following his victory in North Down over the DUP’s Alex Easton  Stephen Farrys victory in North Down is something of a homecoming for him. Back in  he represented the area as mayor, later becoming its MLA.Twelve years later he is now the constituencys MP - a triumph for Alliance which few political pundits would have been comfortable betting their money on until yesterday, with most predicting the seat was there for the DUPs taking.Dr Farrys Westminster win is no mean feat - voters held his successor, the independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon, in huge affection. Like Lady Hermon, he is a firm Remainer, and during his campaign he was keen to stress their shared Brexit position.A Queens University graduate in Politics with a PhD in International Relations, Dr Farry is only the second Alliance politician to be elected to Westminster in its history.A fitting development, perhaps, given the Newtownards man is arguably Alliances second most high-profile name, behind leader Naomi Long.During his tenure in the Executive, he served as minister for employment and learning, and gained widespread praise for capping tuition fees in September . Following the  Assembly elections, he took up positions on the Stormont Committee for the Economy and Business Committee, positions he held until the collapse of power-sharing in .His political work has also garnered global attention: in  he was appointed an International Peace Scholar by the US Institute of Peace. The -year-old has always been a passionate advocate of Alliances cross-community ethos, but he himself has been caught in the crossfire of Northern Irelands green and orange politics.In , after fellow party members on Belfast City Council voted in favour of restricting the flying of the Union flag at City Hall to specic days throughout the year, his own constituency office in Bangor was the target of an attempted arson attack. But with Alliances gains in this latest election, Dr Farry will be hoping it indicates potential for growing the middle ground in local politics. *Stephen Farry was not available for an interview yesterday.Stephen FarryAllianceNorth DownWon by: , votesBrexit: Remain"},{"url":null,"title":"stormont talks pressure on ni leaders to restore powersharing or face another election","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The second of them, HMS Queen Elizabeth, was only commissioned last week.Calling the scheme a “farce”, he added that MoD procurement specialists had “continued to squander billions of pounds, enriching some of the worst corporate looters and corrupting public le via the revolving door of officials lobbyists”.“Scrutiny by our MPs has been contemptible. They have built s that already cannot be sent to a serious war against a serious enemy,” wrote Mr Cummings, who is regarded as a key player in the election strategy that produced a victory for Mr Johnson.He poured scorn on the quality of those overseeing the purchasing process, adding: “The officials in charge of multi-billion processes are mostly mediocre, often appalling. In the MoD corruption adds to the problems.”The Conservative Party manesto talked up defence spending, pledging to meet Nato’s target of spending % of GDP on defence in order to keep its members safe.Mr Johnson has said he would go further than that, by increasing the defence budget by “at least .% above inflation every year”.The manesto also mentioned the need to “adapt to new threats” – a concern raised by Mr Cummings in his personal blogs – by investing in cyber security and setting up the UK’s first Space Command.Mr Cummings in March said more money needed to be spent on computing, robotic and articial intelligence, and argued that drones should be given a more central role in defence.The comments have reinforced suggestions that, under Mr Johnson and his right-hand man Mr Cummings, there will be a substantial overhaul of Whitehall in a bid to inject fresh investment into northern areas that elected Tory MPs, many of them for the first time, at the General Election.Mr Cummings, a former adviser at the Department for Education, has written frequently about Whitehall being ill-equipped to deliver the change the country requires.The Sunday Times reported that the Department for Exiting the European Unionwould be scrapped as soon as this week, with the best staff to join the Cabinet Office to boost numbers in Britain’s EU negotiating team.Other ideas include splitting energy and climate change from the business department again and merging the Department for International Trade with the business department.The Foreign Office and the Department for International Development could also be aligned to sht the aid budget’s focus and ensure it aligns with foreign policy goals.Theresa May also presided over a Whitehall shake-up after being elected Tory leader in .The former prime minister created the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategyas a behemoth outfit designed to renew Britain’s economy and give support to emerging green industries.The ex-home secretary also set-up the Brexit department and the international trade department to ready the civil service for Brexit.It was Gordon Brown in  who initially set up the, currently defunct, Department of Energy and Climate Change which now looks as though it could find a new lease of le under Mr Johnson."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons niborn boss tim martin is 44m richer after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The oblong sofa — inspired by typical overstuffed recliners — is upholstered with damaged or otherwise unsellable garments and off-cuts from obsolete stocks of Balenciaga clothing, encased by scrapped transparent vinyl.

Artists and models – including Madonna’s daughter Lourdes Leon – entered the room wearing Desigual, and then removed their clothes and started performing a simulated, fake orgy.Desigual said the performance was: “A representation in which the catalan artist affects the most basic and universal act of love: the kiss.”A traffic jam was made out of sandWhen you’re relaxing on the beach, the last thing you want to think about is being stuck in traffic. However, Argentine artist Leandro Erlich created a traffic jam of  vehicles all made out of sand, sitting right next to the sea. The cars are either sinking into the sand or rising out of it, and the transient installation – called ‘Order of Importance’ – is designed to draw attention to the climate emergency."},{"url":null,"title":"jersey farmer dresses cows in christmas jumpers to usher in festive spirit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In - six people tragically lost their lives as a result of accidental house fires, and four of these fatalities occurred during the winter period.Therefore Northern Ireland Fire  Rescue Serviceis urging the Community to be aware of their own fire safety, and the safety of others, during the winter months and festive period.Alan Walmsley, Assistant Chief Fire  Rescue Officer, explains: “This year I am calling on the Community to look out for each other throughout the winter months. During these colder months it’s more crucial than ever that people check in with their older family, friends and neighbours, and those who are isolated in our community.“Please consider their wellbeing and ensure they have a working smoke alarm. Check their home for Christmas fire hazards, such as candles, Christmas tree lights, portable heaters, and overloaded sockets, and make sure they are being used safely, in order to ‘STOP’ fire in their home. Please refer them to us for free Home Fire Safety Checknecessary.“Also,you hear a neighbour’s smoke alarm going off, don’t ignore it- go and check. If there’s a fire, oryou can’t be sure, ring  and ask for NIFRS.“We want you to enjoy yourself over the coming weeks by following our fire safety advice and ensuring you’re prepared for winter. By looking after your own safety, and the safety of those around you, you are not only helping to protect you and your loved ones from a range of fire and other emergencies, but you are also helping us as a Fire  Rescue Service. We are all ‘Safer Together.’“Our Firefighters continue to be out on the ground engaging with at-risk people and we continue to work with our partners, from other voluntary and statutory organisations, to identy and reach those people who need our help most.“We continue at this time of year to respond to a wide range of emergencies and are well-prepared and well-rehearsed in terms of our contingency planning for any severe weather conditions that we may encounter over the next couple of weeks. “I am encouraging everyone to also think about their own personal preparedness for the challenges that winter weather can bring. Please take extra care while driving as winter weather, combined with the dark evenings and the Christmas rush, heightens the dangers on our roads.“Happy Christmas and stay safe in .” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The charity relies very heavily on support from the public and Community Engagement Officer, Treasa Rice made the trip to Dungiven to receive a cheque from the school this week.Mary Uiacute Dhuibhne who works at the Gaelcholaacuteiste had high praise for the charity. Mary’s son Peadar Pio acquired a brain injury following an accident when playing two years ago and BIM provided much needed support for Peadar Pio and his family. Peadar Pio, who is currently in Rang  in Gaelscoil Neachtain, is now making excellent progress in his recovery, he is back playing footballand is looking very much forward to joining the Gaelcholaacuteiste team next year when he transfers to the school in September.Although the end of November witnessed the end of the fund raising, some members of the staff appear to have grown attached to their new look and have decided not to shave just yet - to the consternation of their co-workers! It might be the case that another campaign may be called for to encourage a clean shaven appearance among staff in the future!In another fundraising event for the same charity, a screening of Miracle on th Street will take place at An Coire, Maghera on Sunday, December .

He succeeds Rt Rev Ken Good who retired from episcopal ministry in May.The stormy December weather did not deter scores of people from the Diocese of Derry and Raphoe, or from the parish where Bishop Forster had been Rector, from travelling to Armagh for the ordination, and the church was filled for the occasion.The congregation heard the preacher, Revd Canon Maurice Elliott – who has known the new bishop since their first day at Theological College – describe Rt Rev Forster as a larger than le personality with an infectious sense of humour. “He will bring an immense range of gts and abilities to this new role,” Canon Elliott said. “He is a man of deep conviction, yet he tempers this with an instinctive capacity to care.”Canon Elliott said from the moment, just over  years ago, that he and Bishop Forster arrived “literally together” into Braemor Park, to begin theological training, they had struck up what had become a lelong friendship. It was a singular honour, he said, to have been invited by the Archbishop to preach on this momentous occasion of Bishop Forster’s consecration.Their long friendship did not prevent the preacher from sharing one story – at the Bishop-elect’s expense – from the rugby pitch at Trinity College during their first year of training together in . “In the rather vain pursuit of fitness,” he said, “the Bishop-elect and I decided we would attend Monday evening rugby training and we were perhaps only five minutes into a warm-up when the coach told us to get into pairs. So, the two of us joined forces. The instruction then followed that we were each to piggyback our partner the width of the pitch and back which I, having opted to be number one, duly did. Then, as the coach shouted for a swt role reversal, I can honestly say I’ve never seen anyone move so fast in the direction of the changing room as he shouted back over his shoulder in my general direction, ‘Come on, we’re going.’ And to be fair, we never went back.“So,” Canon Elliott said, “maybe on that occasion, Andrew didn’t quite demonstrate himself willing to carry a heavy burden but, in so many other ways, the Bishop-elect has proved himself more than able to bear signicant responsibility: first through the years of his curacy at Willowfield then as a chaplain at Queen’s as Incumbent of Drumclfe and most recently as a much, much loved Rector of Drumglass.”The preacher said he had never heard anyone express anything other than deep appreciation of every facet of the Bishop-elect’s ministry. “As a teacher, as a pastor, as an evangelist, as a leader, as an Archdeacon, through his involvement in the structures of the General Synod and the Representative Body, Andrew has shown himself to be diligent, capable, faithful, popular and loving. And in all of this he has been wonderfully supported by Heather, by Hannah, Patrick, Megan, by his wider family, and, not least, also by his late parents Victor and Joan. And Andrew, we all recognise how deeply proud they would have been to have witnessed this moment.”“Bishop-elect Andrew James Forster,” the preacher said, addressing his friend directly, “on this day our deepest prayer for you is that you will stay close to the Lord who was willing to suffer on your behalf. We ask that you may remain focused on the message of the Cross and the empty tomb and that as you are able to do that you will prove yourself not only faithful but resilient and strong. Thirty years ago, you didn’t feel minded to run across a rugby pitch with me on your back but, as you learn increasingly to lean on the Lord’s word for strength and on the Lord’s spirit for stamina, our confidence is that you will run well the marathon of episcopal ministry and that in due course you will finish that race. You cannot do it in your own strength, so even now choose again to undertake it only in the name, and for the sake of, the one who laid down his le for you, and who alone is able to sustain you.”The Archbishop of Armagh, Most Revd Dr Richard Clarke, was assisted during the Consecration by the Bishop of Meath and Kildare, Most Revd Patricia Storey and the Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry, Right Revd Patrick Rooke. The three were joined for the laying on of hands by the other Church of Ireland serving and retired bishops present, including Lord Eames – a former Bishop of Derry and Raphoe. Next, the newly ordained bishop was vested with his episcopal habit, before being presented to the congregation by the Archbishop, with the words, “Brothers and sisters in Christ, I present to you Andrew, Bishop in the Church of God.” Bishop Forster was then acclaimed with warm and loud applause.Among the many dignitaries from other Churches at the Consecration were the President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, Rev Sam McGuffin the President of the Irish Council of Churches, Rev Brian Anderson , the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, Archbishop Eamon Martin and the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Dr William Henry. North West Church leaders present included the Bishop of Derry, Dr Donal McKeown the Bishop of Raphoe, Most Rev Alan McGuckian and the Methodist Superintendent, Rev Richard Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Council have supported calls to amend the Common Travel Agreementbetween Ireland and Britain.Lilian SeenoI-Barr said the passing of motions at both council meetings last week was most welcome and much appreciated by many migrants here as the Agreement as it currently operated discriminated, she claimed, against non-European people living on the island of Ireland. Speaking yesterday Mrs Seenoi Barr explained why the amendment was necessary: As someone who came from a non-EU country I experienced many of the restrictions the CTA imposed on me. For example, despite the fact I lived in Culmore I could not, quite literally, go half a mile down the road to Muff to buy a pint of milk. If I crossed the Border I was committing a crime. And this was despite the fact I was living in the North legally.She went on: The Common Travel Agreement was first agreed about a  years ago, in very dferent circumstances. I dont think it was envisaged back then that people from Africa or wherever would be living here. But thats how it is now. EU citizens can move freely between the North and the South, butyou are not an EU citizen you cant.I know of a nurse from South African living in Letterkenny who was detained for three days because she went to visit relatives in Scotland using Belfast airport. A Syrian boy in Belfast with a le-threatening heart condition needed emergency treatment that was only available in Dublin. Civil servants literally worked around the clock to sort out the red tape to ensure he could get that treatment. A young student in Derry couldnt go on a school trip to Dublin because she needed a visa. Every day we hear more and more about the impact of these kind of petty restrictions.Thanking everyone involved she said she wanted to acknowledge the support of all councillors from the ious parties who supported the motions calling for amendment to the CTA submitted by Councillor Martin Reilly in Derry and in Donegal by the chairman of Donegal Co. Council, Councillor Nicholas Crossan, who has also confirmed that Donegal Council has send a letter to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the issue.The North West Migrants Forum has been to the forefront in leading the campaign for the amendment and Director Seenoi Barr said she had had a number of meetings with councillors and other interested parties in recent weeks seeking their support to ensure that this was seen as a cross Border campaign. She has also been in constant touch with the British Council to get their backing.Mrs Seenoi Barr concluded: The CTA needs to be amended because it is no longer fit for purpose. Times have changed. If we are serious about inclusion and belonging then we must stand up for people across all sections of the community who are being discriminated against or being treated unfairly. Our objective is to ensure that all who live legally on the island of Ireland have the same rights as privileges as each other. I have spoken to many elected representatives, on both sides of the Border and in Britain, and as we have clearly seen in recent days there is real support for getting it changed. And we here at the North West Migrants Forum will be leading from the front in the campaign to ensure that it is. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The news has had an huge impact on players and clubs across the Irish League and beyond and Cltonville manager McLaughlin admitted Thompsons death is a huge loss to everyone in football.  The recent death of Jerry Thompson has shocked fotoball. googletag.cmd.push “I only knew him as an opponent but he was one of those players you would always be looking out for in the other team because he had that bit of quality that youd be worried about,” he said. “Its sad for his family and its sad for football and my thoughts and prayers go out to his family, his team mates and also his friends. Its devastating to have this to deal with but sadly its all too common in Northern Ireland at the minute.”The nature of Thompsons death, particularly for someone so young, has resumed the conversation about the importance of mental health and McLaughlin agreed that todays youth are often fighting battles that few realise.“Its a stark reminder of young players and what they have to deal with these days in terms of social media and the pressures of le,” he continued.“Some of them take on the pressures of the world and it doesnt have to be like that because there are people out there who can help. Theres probably not enough help on hand for young people in general, not just footballers so I think we should all be looking into that a lot more. I dont think theres enough done about it in general, but at club level I think every club should be looking into it. I think every club should have someone on board who young players can come and speak to about anything at all.“To be fair to Cltonville and I know a lot of clubs are the same, they have a club chaplain on board and ours is there every training session and there every game. Hes there to speak to anyone about anything at all, good and bad, and its good to have that about. “Maybe clubs should be looking to have professional help on site at all times for young players because the pressures of le do get to them a lot and they have so much to deal with so perhaps clubs should look into that.”The loss of Thompson will be keenly felt in footballing circles for some time to come and McLaughlin emphasised the importance of remembering his legacy.“It would scare you,” he admitted. “It would scare you thinking about how the mind works and how young people think. Jerry had a young family, and he was a hard-working young man and he was playing in the Irish League and people would probably look and say he has everything he needs, but people dont know what goes on in others minds and what theyre dealing with behind closed doors. “This would probably scare a lot of players into seeking help andthere is any good to come from it, hopefully it does encourage people to seek professional help and be more open with their problems.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An economist is also helping compile the document.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local authorities paired with Belfast City Council, universities and theprivate sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes across the Province, with the remainder of the cash expected to come from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.At this weekrsquos meeting of the councilrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee, politicians were told that officials have been working on the detailed outline business case since last May, with a consultancy team helping prepare the document.Council officials say that when work on the business case is completed next spring, it will provide a detailed analysis and assessment of the projectrsquos strategic fit within the City Deal.In addition, the document will also outline detailed project costs, the benefits, risks and funding requirements.Politicians were told this week that the documentrsquos analysis will recommend a particular procurement route in order to deliver the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the ongoing development of the business case involves planning considerations and the development of exemplar design and output specications, prior to any formal procurement exercise being undertaken.Politicians were informed on Monday night that the outline business case will provide detail on the technical expertise in terms of the design, construction and maintenance of similar international attractions and also provide detailed analysis of commercial operations of a visitor attraction of this scale.It is understood that council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.Other aspects of the Mournes Gateway scheme include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision.There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes, with a so-called green travel network which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency and other key players..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019

Someone came forward and this was welcomed by elderly people who would not be forced to travel outside the town to access services.Cllr Walker says it is vital that Ballynahinch retains its dedicated postal office and appealed to someone the townrsquos business community to consider taking over the service.ldquoBallynahinch is Down Districtrsquos third largest town and it would be a body blowthe planned temporary closure became permanent, he said.ldquoThe bottom lines appears to be thatno one comes forward to offer to run the service it will close and that will impact on people across the community.ldquoThe role of local post offices has changed considerably over recent years, with many transferring to large supermarkets which ensured that they were open for much longer, including weekends.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices, not banks. That is one of the many reasons why this vitally important service is not lost to Ballynahinch.

And while there is a signicant financial benefit for securing geopark status, council officials insist the benefits are not just economic.They have previously argued that geoparks have a ldquosignicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.Currently, there are three designated geoparks in Ireland. In addition to the Marble Arch Caves in Fermanagh, they include The Burren and Clfs of Moher in Co Clare and the Copper Coast geopark in Co Waterford.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed on Monday afternoon that the local authorityrsquos bid for geopark was formally submitted last month..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Publication.jpg","title":"Book delves into the history around Strangford  ","story":"INVERBRENA Local History Group has launched the latest edition of its annual magazine mdash just in time for Christmas.Memories From Inverbrena: Strangford  features a selection of memories, stories, histories and photographs of people and places within the Strangford area, preserved for future generations.The magazine includes an article by Michael McConville in which he chronicles the history of the the local parish drama club during the s and s, including a selection of photographs of local amateur actors and actresses who participated in some of the popular well received productions.In his second article in this yearrsquos publication, Michael remembers happy days potato picking, recalling how everyone worked together as a team, both boys and girls, and all getting the same pay at the end of the day.Melanie Hamill puts pen to paper to provide an invaluable record of her splendid conversion of Strangford Presbyterian Church, earning it the prestigious  Heritage Angel award for Best Rescue of a Historic Building Or Place for projects under pound million.

McIlhone won the ball off a Ballynagross defender and without even looking up let one fly from  yards out.Goalkeeper Ross Preece was stranded in no manrsquos land and his despairing outstretched attempt to tip the ball over the crossbar failed as the ball nestled in the back of the net.Two minutes later, man of the match Ross Armstrong made it -. He chased a lost cause of a ball into the box where Marron and Preece were favourites to win the race, but Armstrongrsquos sheer desire helped to get him to the ball first and he was able to dink it into an empty net.With  minutes gone Armstrong pounced again to make it - after McIlhone had carved out the opening.Killough continued to bombard Ballynagross with everything and anything, but Ballynagross bravely weathered the storm and gradually started to create chances of their own.With  minutes gone they patiently worked an opening for Ryan McKinney, but he was denied a goal when the impressive Sean Og Burns got back to hack the ball off the line.That was as good as it got for Ballynagross as Killough made it - three minutes later. Gareth George picked the ball up from a Ben McLaughlin throw and immediately set off on one of his trademark, penetrating runs.George had only one thing on his mind after leaving three players for dead and his unerring finish into the bottom corner had Preece clutching at thin air.Six minutes later it was - when Armstrong headed a free back across the box and McIlhone had all the time in the world to send Killough into delirium.With  minutes gone a delightful cross from Adam George was met perfectly by Armstrong and the big striker powered an unstoppable header to the net to make it -.Some of Killoughrsquos play in the first half was breathtaking and few teams could have lived with them and as the players trooped off at half-time, everyone feared for Ballynagross.However, the break gave Campbell the chance to reorganise his troops and the were a dferent proposition in the second half.Marron pulled one back from the spot after Sean Og Burns took down Philip Doran in the box, but despite creating several other chances, that was it for Ballynagross.Eoin Rooney and Conor McCarron had shots well saved by Killough lsquokeeper Eddie Hinc, while Liam Graham headed over at the other end and Preece saved from Gareth George.Killough were a pale shadow of the side that lit up Binnian Park in the first  minutes, but they can be forgiven for taking their foot off the pedal after taking a - lead.Ballynagross can only reflect on what might have been, had they been able to field at full strength, but football can be a cruel game as they found out on Friday night.Killough: Eddie Hinc, Matthew Burns, Ben McLaughlin, Colm Stranney, Sean Og Burns, Matt McKiernan, Gareth George, Adam George, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Riain Burns: Subs: Liam Graham, Seamas Tumelty, Ryan McIlhone, Robbie Hagan, Ruairi Sharvin.Ballynagross: Ross Preece, Deaglan Craig, Tom McNeill, Aaron Beattie, Conor Marron, Conor McCarron, Karl Johnston, Mark Magill, Daniel Taggart, Declan Dowie, Ryan McKinney.

Her ship was the last passenger ship to sail to the continent for many years, as most ships were then commissioned for the war effort, Mary explained.The young nun swapped the green fields and rain of home for the blistering heat and bustle of Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, which must have been quite an experience.She completed her religious formation and academic teacher training before taking her vows in . Over the following decades she taught in several schools. Eventually, on retiring, she was assigned a new mission, opening a clinic and a pre-school within an encampment that catered for over , refugees fleeing the horrors of the Mozambique war.In Sr Bartholomewrsquos own words of this period in her le, recorded in a book written over  years ago, Drumgooland ndash A Parish Divided, she recalls: ldquoWith missionary zeal we did our utmost over the following years to render whatever assistance we could to the many thousands of refugees, I taught including adults.ldquoThese poor people had a minimum of education and were eager to learn English. After class we would sit around and read the bible in Shangaan, the local language, and gave help when it was needed.Niece Mary takes up the story again. She added: ldquoNuns donrsquot retire and while Sr Bartholomew found the intense heat too much after several years, she made for the cooler environment of an office and spent time in general admin.Sr Bartholomew would often make the trip back home to Leitrim after Vatican II came to pass when the rigours and discipline of a pious le became more relaxed in the s. However, she was always looked forward to going back to Port Elizabeth.Her last trip home was some years ago when her older sister, Eileen, was seriously ill.ldquoShe had managed to hold her hand and chat briefly before she passed away, Mary recalled.

The party is entirely focused on the talks on Monday and getting Stormont back up and running,” he told the Sunday Le.“Arlene will be there leading our team. I and others will be there to support the negotiations and that’s our number one priority.”Yesterday Mrs Foster said that the DUP would ensure that the talks ensured that no party could prevent the formation of a devolved administration. She said: “Central to the talks must be the sustainability of the institutions so never again can one party hold the rest of Northern Ireland to ransom. Sinn Fein has barred everyone from government for three years despite other parties willing to take their seats. “We live in a ided society and to move forward will require all the parties to step up to the plate. For my part, we will not be found wanting. Northern Ireland can only move forward when we are prepared to work together.”Sinn Fein TD Martin Kenny appeared on RTE’s The Week in Politics yesterday, saying his party “absolutely wants to be back in Stormont” in January. “We don’t have any red lines, all we have called for is that all parties need to agree to implement the agreements that have already been reached,” he said.Jim Allister: At this crossroads moment unionism can turn away from a Stormont that Sinn Fein will never allow to give good government Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"UUP leader Steve Aiken, who also suffered a bad election, said: “If talks are to be convened this week then it must be on the basis of restoring sustainable, accountable and transparent government.“There is little point in rushing back into Stormont simply because the DUP and Sinn Fein have decided that now the election is over, they are willing to set their own dferences aside. The operation of the Executive, accountability mechanisms for ministers and spads, as well as the petition of concern must all be subject to major reform.”TUV leader Jim Allister warned that unionism is being led in a direction which will prove damaging: “The pretence of Monday’s talks that a restored Stormont will bring stability and good government is a cruel deception ... any such restoration will inevitably be on Sinn Fein’s terms.”He added: “The supplicant plea of the DUP that it has no red lines is as humiliating as it is inane. If ever there was a time for an immovable red line it is now. And that red line should be no Stormont talks until the terminal threat of an Irish Sea border is reversed.“The fact that such hasn’t even been mentioned demonstrates, sadly, that power, any power, means more than our integral position within the UK. Having been led to electoral defeat, unionism is now being led down a path of folly.”try catch  TrendingNI snow now due to arrive earlier than originally thought - severe gales and heavy rain on way tooThis is what the weather will be like in NI on Christmas Day Tragic woman who drowns off NI coast whilst swimming is named locallyWarning of snow and ice for NI -temperatures to dip below freezing tomorrowNI road closed after road traffic collision -

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They have built s that already cannot be sent to a serious war against a serious enemy, wrote Mr Cummings, who is regarded as a key player in the election strategy that produced a victory for Mr Johnson.He poured scorn on the quality of those overseeing the purchasing process, adding: ldquoThe officials in charge of multi-billion processes are mostly mediocre, often appalling. In the MoD corruption adds to the problems. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Dominic Cummings arrives in Downing Street on Monday  --The Conservative Party manesto talked up defence spending, pledging to meet Natorsquos target of spending % of GDP on defence in order to keep its members safe.Mr Johnson has said he would go further than that, by increasing the defence budget by ldquoat least .% above inflation every year.The manesto also mentioned the need to ldquoadapt to new threats ndash a concern raised by Mr Cummings in his personal blogs ndash by investing in cyber security and setting up the UKrsquos first Space Command.Mr Cummings in March said more money needed to be spent on computing, robotic and articial intelligence, and argued that drones should be given a more central role in defence.The comments have reinforced suggestions that, under Mr Johnson and his right-hand man Mr Cummings, there will be a substantial overhaul of Whitehall in a bid to inject fresh investment into northern areas that elected Tory MPs, many of them for the first time, at the General Election. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Boris Johnson is said to want to re-shape Whitehall so it is equipped to help the Government reach northern voters  --Mr Cummings, a former adviser at the Department for Education, has written frequently about Whitehall being ill-equipped to deliver the change the country requires.The Sunday Times reported that the Department for Exiting the European Unionwould be scrapped as soon as this week, with the best staff to join the Cabinet Office to boost numbers in Britainrsquos EU negotiating team.Other ideas include splitting energy and climate change from the business department again and merging the Department for International Trade with the business department.The Foreign Office and the Department for International Development could also be aligned to sht the aid budgetrsquos focus and ensure it aligns with foreign policy goals.Theresa May also presided over a Whitehall shake-up after being elected Tory leader in .The former prime minister created the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategyas a behemoth outfit designed to renew Britainrsquos economy and give support to emerging green industries.The ex-home secretary also set-up the Brexit department and the international trade department to ready the civil service for Brexit.It was Gordon Brown in  who initially set up the, currently defunct, Department of Energy and Climate Change which now looks as though it could find a new lease of le under Mr Johnson..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Defence chiefs brace for overhaul after PM us aide criticises spending article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That can only mean one thing – the dreaded hangover.We’ve all been there, right  That last round of tequila shots sounded like a mighty fine idea, but now it’s the morning after the night before and you are paying for it – with interest.Your head is pounding, your stomach is queasy, and it feels like something small and furry crawled into your mouth overnight and died there.Granted, the damage has well and truly been done – but what can you do about it now  How do you cure that hangover  Heck, can you even cure a hangover Well, that depends on who you ask. There’s a host of weird and wonderful hangover cure claims floating around, but the old saying ‘horses for courses’ applies here. That is to say, what works for one person may not do a thing for another.At the risk of stating the obvious, the best way to avoid a hangover is to drink less alcohol. Or none at all.It’s also a very good idea to eat a decent meal before heading out, and alternating between an alcoholic beverage and a hydrating glass of water can lessen the effects of a hangover.Assuming, though, that all that sage advice went out of the window last night, here’s six hangover cures to try.A hearty bowl of soupOkay, so this is only a good ideayou can still stand straight, but Austrians swear by this method.When you’ve had a skinful of booze, grab a big bowl of goulash soup before heading to bed.It will prevent the alcohol soaking further into your bloodstream, and is always a better idea than that kebab you were craving at am.Eat a protein breakfastDr Andrew Irvine, who published How To Cure A Hangover, suggests a simple breakfast.“Protein, in the form of eggs, will help your hypoglycaemia , as will porridge,” he says. “The headache should ease once the blood sugar level has been corrected, then take some soluble paracetamol.”BeroccaThe Aussies, it’s fair to say, seem know a thing or two about drinking.After one too many tinnies, simply drop a tablet of this over-the-counter, nutrient-packed tablet in a glass of water.Works bestyou do the same before drinking. It may not completely cure your hangover, but it’s a refreshing pick-me-up that’s packed with vitamins.ParacetamolDissolve a soluble paracetamol tablet in a glass of water and not only will it go a long way towards curing that throbbing headache, but it will provide rehydration, which is all important. Unlike Ibuprofen it won’t irritate the stomach.Be warned, though: too much paracetamol is toxic to the liver – and it has probably taken enough of a pounding as it is. and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share by email\" data-param-subject\" ways toand cure your hangover\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"\" and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Facebook\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\" and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Twitter\" data-param-text\" ways toand cure your hangover\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"these are foods you shouldnt feed your dog christmas ","story":"Donaldson wants Stormont You could be owed a Cold Weather Payment thanks to the dip in temperatures - how to checkyou’re eligibleNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleThe ethanol in alcohol can hit an animals bloodstream faster than humans.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
