But there is growing discomfort in Britain’s leading galleries and museums about the impact of this masculine term.The influential head of Tate Modern, Frances Morris, has told the Observer of her dislike of the phrase “masters” as a sign of esteem. “I think we should question its use and what it tells us. I would like to see it replaced by something else,” she said.A new exhibition, Women Modern Masters, which opens in Edinburgh next month, aims to use the word as a gender-neutral accolade, but has found itself in the middle of the controversy.At the Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh, director Christina Jansen knows the title of her show, which was to have been a visual centrepiece of the city’s annual international festival before its cancellation in April, means she is in troubled waters.“It is not intended to be gender specific, but using the word means I have walked into a trap,” Jansen said this weekend. “I think it is a positive thing to talk about the issue. This is a classic art history term and it would be sad to lose it. It is not meant to enrage anyone and in fact we are hoping to inspire and celebrate.”One of the most high-profile uses of the term in the art world is in the title of the annual art market Frieze Masters. For Victoria Siddall, global director of all the Frieze art fairs, the choice of the word was deliberate when it was launched in 2011. “When we settled on the name of the fair it was with the intention of expanding the definition of ‘Masters’. “We have striven to balance the genders and geographies of the artists presented, as well as to give a platform to artists whose work has been overlooked by history. At the same time, it could be argued that the word has become non-gendered over time – Artemisia Gentileschi is indisputably an old master.”Yet the word does give Siddall pause for thought. “We have aimed to prompt discussion and conversation on what it means to be a ‘Master’ with this fair, but equally if a new term emerges we’d happily adopt it,” she said.Another postponed show, at London’s Wallace Collection, set to reopen next month, faces a similar issue because of the colonial implications of the word “master”. The exhibition of undervalued Indian painters is called Forgotten Masters and also hoped to use the term as a positive mark of equality. Curated by the cultural historian William Dalrymple, it showcases work commissioned by officials of the East India Company in the late 18th and 19th centuries. The billing promises to honour “historically overlooked artists including Shaikh Zain ud-Din, Bhawani Das, Shaikh Mohammad Amir of Karriah, Sita Ram and Ghulam Ali Khan and sheds light on a forgotten moment in Anglo-Indian history.”For others who are campaigning to rid creative language of its sexist and imperial legacies, the decision to adapt the meaning of the word master is misguided, although it is embedded deep in English vocabulary.The word derives from the Latin magister, which means chief or head, and has been used to describe authority in schools, in fox hunts, and on plantations. It is also the verb for gaining control of a skill or situation.The online political magazine Shout Out UK, which describes itself as “the voice of the next generation”, considers it outdated. In January this year one article called for the word to be rooted out wherever possible, including its use to describe the main bedroom in a house. It has, it was argued, an “uncomfortable combination of hierarchical, racial and sexist connotations”.At the Scottish Gallery, where Women Modern Masters is preparing to open, even if only as digital show, Jansen argues that the use of the word as a badge of accomplishment is the way forward and a useful marker of how far women artists have come.“It was not that long ago that a woman was not allowed into a life drawing class, although she was allowed to draw a cow. And of course we still have a long way to go in many of our institutions,” she said.“For me the term is totally gender neutral. And many women artists do not want to be considered in that way. They want to be simply artists and are not happy to even hang in all-women shows.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69a7a45dc3a800cb5510cac450c0208f3e11b5b4/1_434_3399_2040/master/3399.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dfe8b39a06b42e9065e143558e34e4c","title":"milton glaser why the new york graphic designer was so influential","story":"The man who came up with the classic I love NY logo died on Friday at 91, leaving a rich legacyIt’s a privilege and occasional frustration for graphic designers that they furnish the backgrounds of the lives of millions, without those millions always being aware that they have done so. So it was for Milton Glaser, who died on Friday, on his 91st birthday.It is hard to think of any visual artist so pervasive in his influence. If you’re of a certain age, you might have noticed his carnivalesque covers on the Signet Classic paperback series of Shakespeare plays, or have owned the poster he made for Bob Dylan’s Greatest Hits, in which bright riotous hair bursts from the singer’s austere silhouette. With the Push Pin Studios, which he helped found in 1954 with fellow graduates of the Cooper Union design school, he can be said to have created what became the look of the 60s: flowing lines, rainbow colours, strong patterns.If you’re younger, you might have come across the swirling “B” of his Brooklyn Beer labels, or his designs for the Mad Men TV series. It will have been almost impossible for anyone, of any age, in the western world not to have come across his “I love NY” motif, invented in 1976 to help lift the city out of despair of near-bankruptcy. Quite apart from the original version, there are countless imitations.Glaser combined a deep seriousness about his own discipline with an openness to inspiration from wherever it could come. He believed in the importance of mastering the skill of drawing, which at one point he studied with the great Italian artist Giorgio Morandi. His work has, in its strength of line and the clarity of its contrasts, the virtues of Bauhaus modernism.At the same time, he explicitly reacted against the puritanism of that tradition. He was promiscuous in his inspirations, borrowing ideas from art nouveau, from Renaissance painting, from Islamic ornament, from pop art, from commercial culture.For New York magazine, which he co-founded in 1968, he co-wrote the “Underground Gourmet” column, on the city’s cheap ethnic restaurants. “The world is a very astonishing place,” he said in old age. “What I feel fortunate about is that I am still astonished, that things still amaze me. The possibility for learning never disappears.”He liked to tell of his childhood experience of being bedridden with rheumatic fever. “The only thing that kept me alive,” he said, was his mother bringing him a daily supply of modelling clay, which he would make into “little universes”, that he would then destroy and remake. The point he took into his professional life was always to create things anew, “to keep moving and not get stuck in my own past”.Again and again, he stressed the importance of continuing to learn. “We are all born with genius,” he said. “It’s like our fairy godmother. But what happens in life is that we stop listening to our inner voices, and we no longer have access to this extraordinary ability to create poetry.”In his work, everything his animate. Letters take on the qualities of living beings. Characters had character. In The Alphazeds, a children’s book that he made with his wife Shirley, the alphabet becomes a series of personalities, progressively joining a party in what starts as an empty room.It is this attitude that makes the “I love NY” emblem, where type and the heart symbol work together, so successful. It also went with a strong sense of humanity and ethics. The logo itself he did pro bono, as he believed in the cause of reviving the city.In his essay “12 Steps on the Graphic Designer’s Road to Hell” he deplored the abuse of design for such things as “a diet product that you know doesn’t work”.He described art, including graphic design, as “a passing on of gifts”, a way of putting something into the world that people can share, “a device to stop people killing each other”. The way to know if a particular job was good, he said, was to ask whether working with the client made you feel happy at the end of the day.Milton Glaser was an archetypal New Yorker, born in the South Bronx to immigrants from Hungary, and spent most of his life in the city. His love of the melting pot, of the human energy of the city’s streets, shines through in his work, but his achievements spread far from there. They came from his ceaseless curiosity and energy. “None of us really has the ability to understand our path,” he said, “until it’s over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b908284adf429e17121688aec9ae6240d3f54c8c/0_0_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efe196cca75ea9a5e24be558240b2c3f","title":"george floyd tributes concert for plants 20 photographs of the week","story":"Black Lives Matter protests continue and Liverpool win the Premier League title – the most striking photographs from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fdf4e3e3b443f480a0ba66df127ea8acb44d7ba/429_726_4450_2670/master/4450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=098e31aa86175cfe4eac3285a265e920","title":"good enough to eat asian american groceries as ceramics in pictures","story":"Artist Stephanie H Shih, who lives and works in Brooklyn, makes ceramic sculptures of Asian American pantry items from the 1980s and 90s. “Groceries are surprisingly intimate,” she says. “We bring them into our homes, we live with them, we feed our loved ones with them – and the project is about the shared nostalgia of a generation raised by east Asian immigrants.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b00e5ff57abd6faee3b02f6480f71ab43631f9d/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1106a38fee7b82215e06b22f9fc875d","title":"me and my detective by lee child attica locke sara paretsky jo nesb and more","story":"Jack Reacher, VI Warshawski, Harry Hole ... Leading crime writers reveal how they came up with their most famous creations, what it’s like to live with them over decades and if they’ll last the distance“I’ve been doing it 24 years now and I couldn’t do it any more,” says Lee Child as he hands over the reins of his Jack Reacher series to his brother Andrew Grant. He’s not the first to tire of his most famous creation. By 1938, Agatha Christie had grown entirely sick of Hercule Poirot, asking: “Why did I ever invent this detestable bombastic, tiresome little creature? Eternally straightening things, eternally boasting, eternally twirling his moustache and tilting his egg-shaped head.” And nearly 50 years earlier, Arthur Conan Doyle was equally wearied by Sherlock Holmes: “I think of slaying Holmes … winding him up for good,” he told his mother.Creating a long-running series featuring a much-loved character can be both a blessing and a curse. As time passes in the real world, the writer has to decide how to deal with a fictional timeline. Is it best to age a hero in real time – Ruth Rendell had Inspector Wexford still solving crimes in his retirement – or to let the world move on but keep your hero young, as Patricia Cornwell does with Kay Scarpetta, who remains around 40 years old for ever ? And how does the character develop as social mores change? Writing about police can be a challenge now. As Attica Locke says of her Texas ranger in her Highway 59 series, “writing a cop is something I thought I’d never do”.In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, John Connolly argues that “a mistrust of the police – a mistrust of the establishment, really – runs through the private eye genre”. “The police represent the law, but the private eye represents the possibility of justice, particularly for those for whom the forces of law and order refuse to stand up: women, minorities, immigrants. For me, a conception of social justice lies at the very heart of the genre.” Sara Paretsky sees crime fiction as the form “where law, justice and society come together in a natural way – that is, you can write about them without being polemical or didactic”. Child says his plots have always “included corrupt, negligent and deficient police departments and federal agencies”. Twenty years ago, though, “people would write to me and say, c’mon, that wouldn’t happen. Now no one says that. Clearly reality is slowly dawning.” Then there’s the question of how, or indeed whether, to draw a series to a close. Christie kills off Poirot in Curtain, and Conan Doyle did his best to wave farewell to Holmes, sending him plummeting to his doom down the Reichenbach Falls.Readers were distraught the author quietly rejoiced – “I hold that it was not murder, but justifiable homicide in self-defence, since, if I had not killed him, he would certainly have killed me” – but by 1903, he’d resurrected him, with fans discovering in a new short story that Holmes hadn’t really died – he’d merely been fooling his enemies.To avoid any such reversals, the late Andrea Camilleri wrote the final novel in his Inspector Montalbano series 14 years ago, giving it to his publisher for safekeeping: “When I get fed up with him or am not able to write any more, I’ll tell the publisher: publish that book. Sherlock Holmes was recovered … but it will not be possible to recover Montalbano. In that last book, he’s really finished.” But what of today’s detectives? How do their authors coexist with their characters over years – sometimes decades – and what lies ahead?If you study English literature you’re taught the character must change and go on a journey. I want very much the opposite. As a reader I love series for the familiarity, so I’ve put effort into stopping Reacher from changing.The best thing to do is not to get too close to the character. I need to like him less than you’re going to like him. That’s what keeps him alive and honest and authentic. There are many series where the author clearly falls in love with the character and starts to be too protective. I’ve always been very hardhearted. I don’t like Reacher that much I’m in total control of him. I’m the only person in the world he’s scared of.Initially I had the idea that in the last book, he would die in a blaze of glory or noble self-sacrifice. I even had a title, Die Lonely. But it dawned on me that would be gratuitously cruel to the reader who had supported him for so long.So I thought maybe we could have a metaphorical version, where he’s heading for the bus depot to leave town but stops and thinks, “maybe I’ll stay here and adopt a dog”. But I moved through that and thought: “Let’s let Andrew keep it going.” He really is me 15 years ago, still full of energy, still full of ideas, and so I think this is the perfect solution. I will always continue to tell these stories in my head.I never had any intention of doing a series. And then I went to work in television and it was fun to hang out with characters for a long period of time. Darren was the last piece of the puzzle. I was infinitely more interested in location and in telling a very Texas story, in particular a story about Highway 59, which is a route through the eastern part of the state. All of my family are from little towns along this highway, and my idea was that every book would be about a different town and a different crime, but I didn’t have anyone at the centre of it, and I had to figure out who that would be.So I’m thinking of a character who could be involved in crimes across the state. Who could that be? Is it a lawyer, is it a PI, who has that kind of range? And I went: “Oh! A Texas ranger – that’s literally what they do, range.” Once I knew I wanted to write about a ranger I had to educate myself, and get comfortable with the idea. I’m married to a criminal defence attorney, I’m a black American, my whole thing was that I don’t see the world through a cop’s eyes, what am I going to do? Then I read a book called Ghettoside by Jill Leovy, which is about police failing to catch and prosecute people who commit crimes against black life. In it there’s a black cop who works with the police in south LA, and his approach is: “I wear the badge in order to protect the black folk who live in this neighbourhood.” And when I read that, it’s like my mind could shift, and I could understand writing a black cop. I also gave him all the same ambivalence I have about law enforcement.I have a sense this series is four books. It blows my mind to think of writing these for ever, it terrifies me. I know what Darren will be up against in book four, but I don’t know how the whole thing ends.I had the idea for a psychological profiler. I thought if I made the liaison in the police a female officer that would give it added tension. At the time there really weren’t many women in senior positions. I didn’t know at that point it would be a series but as I progressed through the novel it seemed to me that not only were Tony Hill and Carol Jordan interesting characters, the jobs they did meant I could draw in other topics.If I’d thought it was going to be a long-running series I would probably have set it in a real city. Writing in a fictional city gives you lots of opportunities – when you want a premier league football team you just stick it down in the middle – but you never have that same sense of solidity. But I made the decision because I knew that this novel was going to be critical of the police and I really didn’t want to get done for speeding.I feel an affection for Tony and Carol, a sympathy for what they’ve been through. Who knows how old they are? They’ve probably aged about one year for every book, rather than in real time. It’s fiction and I can do what I want. I guess they’re about mid-40s.The one thing I’ve promised readers is that I won’t kill either of them. But I’ve never had an overall arc. Can you imagine being Sue Grafton and sitting down and writing A Is for Alibi and thinking: “Well only 25 to go?”The spark for Charlie Parker was an image of a man going to visit the grave of his wife and child, flowers in the back of the car. For me the big thing was letting the characters grow older. You can take the Patricia Cornwell route, which is to keep your characters a certain age all the way through but the series can’t really develop if you do that because you’re just going to keep repeating certain tropes, the character is set in aspic. The other option is to do what somebody like James Lee Burke has done with Robicheaux, who ages with the writer effectively. Robicheaux is into his early 70s, so the books become meditations on mortality.As the characters age, the nuances, the textures of the books change. There’s a misapprehension about mystery fiction, which is that people read for plot. They don’t – the plots really don’t change much. There’s a murder. There’s an investigation. There’s a solution, however partial. Plot is what characters do and language is the expression of that, and so for a mystery series what keeps people coming back is the pleasure of spending time with those characters.If my doctor said don’t go booking any holidays after November, I know how I would choose to end the series. For the moment, though, I still like looking at the world through his eyes.I had this idea for three women who were doing environmental surveys in Northumberland. I killed one of them off, and about a third of the way through, because I don’t plot at all, I got really stuck. That’s when Vera appeared like magic, through a door in a funeral home, fully formed with her name, looking more like a bag lady than a detective. I hadn’t planned her. But of course characters don’t come out of nowhere, so I think she came from the spinsters that I knew in the small town where I grew up – very strong, very competent, didn’t care what they looked like.Once she’d appeared I wanted to write more about her, and about the places in the north of England where I lived: the vast empty inland hills, and Hadrian’s Wall, the beaches and castles and post-industrial communities. Vera’s definitely not ageing in real time. In my head she’s in her mid-to-late 50s and she was that 21 years ago. The world around her goes forward in real time.With my Shetland Island series, I knew that I was only going to do eight books, because Shetland doesn’t have that variety of landscape or community and there are only 23,000 people who live on the islands. You can’t kill them all. So I knew that towards the end of books seven and eight, I had to be thinking about how it was going to end.I would struggle to write just one series with one character. I can come to the end of a Vera book now and think I’m going to find out a little more about Matthew Venn, my new character. He comes from north Devon, which is where I grew up. He is gay. He’s got a husband, and he comes back to Devon because of his husband’s job. It was a bit daunting starting a new series, but I’m just starting the second Matthew book. It’s great to write about a happy marriage. I’ve never done that before.Ex-con Zaq Khan and his best friend Jags are drawn from me and my friends. I grew up in Ealing and hung out a lot in Southall. It was a really colourful area, and there were two authors who made me think I wanted to set a story there. The first was Elmore Leonard his heroes aren’t always policemen, sometimes they’re just ordinary people, sometimes they’re small-time criminals, and I thought “Wow, you don’t have to write from the detective’s perspective if you’re writing a crime novel.” And then I read Walter Mosley’s Easy Rawlins books, set in the black community in LA in the 1940s, and I saw you could tell those stories through a character of colour. It was the sort of book I was hoping someone would write, but no one had done it.Even though Zaq is done for a violent crime, he’s the main character and I wanted people to root for him and empathise with him. It was about allowing the reader to see that he’s not a bad person and he has a moral code he wants to do the right thing. I wrote Brothers in Blood as a standalone. It got rejected by about 30 publishers, basically down to it being too Asian, so I self-published it, and then it got picked up by Dialogue.The second book, Stone Cold Trouble, is out in September. It’s set a few months after the first. When I’m writing the next book I’ll have to be referencing the lockdown and Covid-19. I may do that but in a very light way.I had an idea of writing about contemporary Edinburgh and trying to show its darker side, and I thought a cop was a good way to do that. By book number four, I thought: Oh, this guy is sticking around. Mainly because I enjoy spending time with him – he’s a complex character. And because a detective is a very good way of looking at society. I wanted to take on politics and issues to do with people feeling dispossessed or disenfranchised. Rebus would allow me to look at the world, from the people who’ve got everything down to the people who’ve got nothing.I made the decision early on that he would age more or less in real time. And there are problems with that, as I’ve discovered. He had to retire. He retired twice, in fact. He retired at the end of Exit Music because he had hit the mandatory retirement age for police detectives in Scotland. I found a way to keep him in the force working as a civilian for a while. Then even that had to come to an end.But I keep finding things for him to do. I’m writing one at the moment. He’s got health issues now but he’s still getting into trouble and mysteries are still there to be solved. Maybe this is the final book. I have no idea until I get to the end. It was something that I had wanted to do ever since I first read Raymond Chandler. In six of his seven novels, it’s a woman who’s sexually active who turns out to be the main villain. And I just was tired of this femme fatale idea in a lot of crime fiction, that women who use their bodies to try to get good boys to do bad things inevitably come to a terrible end.I was working in the corporate world in the financial services industry, for a real pill of a guy, and I was looking out at the dead trees in Grant Park and the balloon over my head was saying something unprintable while my lips were saying something sweetly soothing to the male vanity. And at that moment, really, quite truly, VI came to me. I thought, she is someone who says what’s in the balloon over her head. She is not interested in making nice. She’s facing the challenges that women did face in the 1980s, being pioneers in occupations that had been shut off to women over the centuries.When I started, I wanted her to age in real time. As time passed, I’ve stopped her age around 50 because I just don’t want VI to be helpless. As the world becomes an ever more shocking place, it’s important to me to have someone who’s really vibrant and not going to be mowed down. Physically she has to be very tough as well.People in the industry talk about the character being your “brand”. Well, thank you, she is not Pampers or a tampon, she is a person alive in my imagination, not a commodity to be bought and sold by other people.I always knew I was going to write a series. I wanted to look at the period of British rule in India between 1919 and independence and in my head, rather naively, I thought, right, I’m going to do one a year: 1919 all the way to 1947. Four and a half books in, am I going to? I doubt it.Sam Wyndham and Surendranath Banerjee came to me as a package. That’s partly because they’re really just different aspects of my own personality. Sam is my jaded Scottish side even though he’s English he has a very Glaswegian, gallows humour. Suren is my Indian side, my more questioning side. When you grow up between different cultures, you have this inner dialogue that just goes on constantly.I’ve always known that there will be a falling out between the two. I’d like to see Suren as the first non-white chief of police in Calcutta, in independent India, but there’s a long way to go before that. The story I really want to tell is 1943, the story of the Bengal famine. I don’t feel confident enough to write it yet. It’s such an emotive subject, I think you need to have a readership with you, to tackle issues like that.When I started out, Sam and Suren were essentially tools to tell the story of colonial India but they’ve become so much more to me. I never thought I would fall in love with them the way I have. I’m not sure I could kill them off, it would feel a bit like amputating part of myself. I’d like to see them have a long, happy retirement one day.Nobody expected that the television series Prime Suspect would become such a monster hit. I went to the Met and said: “Do you have any high-ranking female plain clothes detectives?” I was told “Yes, we have three.” One of them, a DCI, was called Jackie Malton, and I followed her for months. She was determined I would get it right, and she opened up avenues which, without her, I never could have got to. Now I’m writing a new series about DC Jack Warr. You don’t want to create something that everyone says: “Seen it, heard it, boring.” I began to notice how often in fiction we were seeing troubled heads of departments: a DI with a marriage problem, a drink problem, drugs problems, his wife was leaving him, his daughter was a heroin addict. So I wanted to create somebody who was a perfectly happy, lovely guy. No problems whatsoever, a great relationship, adores his parents. I wanted to write a character who you saw going through the process of learning to be a detective.I was a journalist covering real detectives, and at night trying to write fiction about detectives. In 1988, I spent a week with the head of the homicide squad in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The next thing I wrote ended up being the first Harry Bosch book. I loved reading series, so writing one was my goal in life. I really set the character up so that I could write more about him. I gave him an unsolved mystery in his life, his mother’s murder.I’d clearly said in that first book that he was 42 years old, and my plan was to write in real time so he’d really age. If I’d had any inkling that I’d be writing about this guy for 25 years or more, I would have made him younger. But I’ve stuck with that and now teamed him up with a younger detective, I think that’s one way of keeping it going. He’s not going out to pasture, but it’s been five years or more since he’s actually been a real cop, because it’s not believable that some 70-year-old guy would still have a badge and a gun and work for the LAPD.Really I wanted the first Tom Thorne book, Sleepyhead, to be about the victim of a particular crime, so I just sort of dumped this copper on the page without thinking too much more about it. I never dreamed I’d be writing about him 20 years later.Maybe I should have made him a little bit younger but I thought he’d be easier to write if he was the same age as me. I’ve slowed him down a bit. Also I’ve stopped specifying when a book is set because I realised quite early on that you can get into trouble. If you’re writing about a real city – the books are set very much in a real London – you can be quickly overtaken by events. The book I have coming out this year is a prequel, so I’ve been able to go back and set it in the mid-1990s, with Thorne as a much younger man. That’s been hugely liberating, not just because of the fact that I’m writing about a world that isn’t dominated by CCTV and the internet.It will end when I’m not interested in writing about it. I don’t see him running an antiques shop in the Cotswolds but I would fight shy of killing him off. He’s someone I’m incredibly close to and I don’t want to think about his end more than I do my own. If he was going to go, he would be listening to George Jones or Hank Williams while watching Spurs. I was on my way to Australia back in 1997, and I had promised an editor I’d write something. She wanted me to write about my band at the time but I had five weeks in Australia and thought I would write a short crime novel so I needed a protagonist for that. I sat on the plane to Sydney and came up with Harry. I didn’t put much analysis into it. It was more instinct – I knew I wanted a character that was partly a traditional, hard-boiled detective, combined with characters I knew from my own life. I had no idea he would be with me for so long – I thought it was a one-off.It’s easier the more I write about him – I get to know him and I know my readers know him. There will always be emotional and psychological contradictions which make him interesting to me. As you get older you’re more interested in your old friends than getting new friends, and it’s a bit the same with Harry.I have a clear idea for the storyline of his life. I won’t tell you what it is, though."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e33754405d4b83063b4ab926b16fc67df188e42a/0_85_2865_1720/master/2865.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0254ebde8d982161b28917356977f97","title":"nicole chung if my life were fiction you would not believe it","story":"The Korean-American author on being raised by a white family, the search for her birth parents and the risk-averse nature of publishingNicole Chung, 39, was born in Seattle and placed for adoption by her Korean parents, before being raised by a white family in Oregon. Her memoir, All You Can Ever Know, shares her experience of the prejudice she faced as a trans-racial adoptee and her search for her birth family. The memoir was published to acclaim in the US, with the Washington Post calling it one of the year’s finest books. Chung is an editor for digital literary magazine Catapult, and lives in the Washington DC area.Your parents took a “colourblind” approach to raising you, where race wasn’t really acknowledged…My adoptive parents took this approach on the clear, specific advice of adoption professionals. The judge who finalised my adoption told them “just assimilate her and everything will be fine”. I don’t think that’s as common now more and more people acknowledge the fact that race is extremely relevant to that child and how their life will unfold and how others will view them.Have you had feedback from your birth and adoptive parents?My adoptive mother recently passed away, and my adoptive father actually passed in 2018. So he didn’t get to finish it, but he got to read everything that he was in. One of the last conversations I had with my father was actually about the book: it was around the holidays and he told me it had been a really great Christmas present. I shared a draft with members of my birth family as well – I wanted everybody to have a chance to talk about it, and for them to raise concerns or questions.You mentioned not seeing people like you in books when you were growing up. Has that changed, or is publishing lagging behind?I think publishing always lags behind. A lot of us have been saying for years that readers are more than ready and willing, and you see that in the success of many books by writers who are really under-represented in literature. But publishing is slow, and averse to what it views as risky. It’s a real problem.Do you feel that publishers have viewed your work as risky?You never really know. There’s lots of legitimate reasons why an editor or house might not connect with a particular project. But I didn’t have a ton of offers I didn’t have solid offers from big houses. I do remember a few comments – it’s often quite veiled, like “I just had a hard time connecting”. One woman did ask me if I thought anyone would read it besides Koreans or adopted people.What were your favourite books or authors as a child?I love EB White. For me it was more The Trumpet of the Swan than Charlotte’s Web.

But some employers are slowly reopening workplaces – and the slight easing of lockdown rules in England (there are variations across the UK) could have implications for offices getting back to work.Here is what the easing will mean for them.The guidance, available on the government’s risk-assessment tool for England, on who should return to the office has not changed since the very start of lockdown: anyone who can work from home should do so. There are no restrictions on the types of office work that are allowed for those who cannot work from home, as long as they can observe physical distancing where possible.However, workers who are vulnerable or shielding should not go to the office, and employers have a duty to provide a safe workplace. Anyone with Covid-19 symptoms must stay at home.Every company returning to work has a legal duty to carry out a written risk assessment if it has more than five employees, and employers must consult elected staff representatives.Many offices that do reopen borrow measures already pioneered in factories and shops that have remained open, with screens or barriers to separate people, one-way systems and staggered arrival times.And, of course, the frequency of handwashing, hand-sanitiser stations and the cleaning of all touch points (such as doors) will increase dramatically.The big change for workers on 4 July will be on physical distancing rules. Employers must still make “every reasonable effort” to allow workers to stay apart, but the government guidelines have been tweaked from spacing employees 2 metres apart at all times to “1 metre with risk mitigation where 2 metres is not viable” – also known as “1-metre-plus”.This means workers are still urged to stay two metres apart where possible, but with some leeway if measures such as face masks, protective screens or making people face away from each other are introduced. This could mean, for instance, that two people could theoretically pass each other in a narrower corridor, or more people could fit in lifts – although it is likely many businesses will not risk it until rules ease further, given the legal and health concerns. Businesses who spoke to the  said they were confused over how the guidelines should be implemented in offices.Some professional services firms have started the phased return of small proportions of workers where they feel comfortable, including law firm CMS, accountancy Deloitte, advertising company WPP, and investment banks Barclays, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs.Yet many businesses have expressed caution over a full return to the workplace any time soon. Edwin Morgan, director of policy at the Institute of Directors, said there had not been a “mad rush back to the office” and that “many directors will err on the side of caution”.The Confederation of British Industry said that most British offices would stick to 2 metres’ distancing and that only businesses where employees could avoid public transport would gradually return – and only if people still can’t work from home.Transport remains one of the main obstacles to a wholesale return to offices."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be3d6d08c327c6f74dc3e90430c04ffdc7145d69/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=e447f78673751d4aaf371771a2eae6f1","title":"is it payback time for apple as the eu goes after its licences to print money","story":"The US giant faces a probe into its lucrative App Store and, more interestingly, the tech behind its phone payment systemOn 16 June, the European commission opened two antitrust investigations into Apple’s App Store and Apple Pay practices. The first investigation will examine whether Apple has broken EU competition rules with its App Store policies. The second investigation is into whether restrictions imposed by Apple on the near field communication (NFC) capability of its iPhone and Apple Watch mean that banks and other financial institutions are prevented from offering NFC payment systems using Apple kit.The store opened on 10 July 2008 with an initial stock of 500 apps. As of January this year it had upwards of 2m. As a digital distribution platform it’s been a howling success and I think has worked well for consumers, because nothing gets on to the store without being fairly thoroughly vetted by Apple. As a result, the iOS software ecosystem is safer than its Android counterpart, where in addition to the dominant Google Play store there are numerous other app stores, so the Android ecosystem has been consistently less secure than the iOS one. Which looks like a vindication of Apple’s iron control over its app store.The two that triggered the EC investigation came from Spotify, the streaming music service, and Rakuten on behalf of its Kobo subsidiary, which sells ebooks through the App Store. Just to rub salt into Apple’s regulatory wounds, Microsoft pitched in last week, when its president, Brad Smith, declared that “it’s time for antitrust regulators in the US and Europe to discuss tactics that app stores use to take advantage of those who want to distribute their software”. Given that Microsoft was the original digital monopolist, this is a case of the slag heap calling the kettle black.Antitrust suits are generally nasty and complex and this one will be no different. But the NFC investigation is, in a way, more interesting. When, in pre-pandemic times, I used to physically shop in supermarkets and other shops, NFC was the technology that enabled me to pay by just holding my Apple watch up to the card reader. This was not only convenient, but in general it avoided the £30 limit on contactless cards. In the early days, checkout staff were unduly dazzled by this and so I deprecated it by explaining that I had to pay a fortune for the watch that enabled it, so perhaps it wasn’t that clever after all. Still, provided you had the necessary – and expensive – Apple kit, it was very convenient.The concern that seems to have launched the investigation is that Apple has restricted access to the NFC capability of its iPhone and Apple Watch, which means that banks and other financial service providers can’t offer NFC payments through their own apps. The increase in mobile payments in Europe as a result of the coronavirus pandemic has given Margrethe Vestager, the head of the EU’s antitrust ision, a rationale for its Apple Pay investigation. “It appears that Apple sets the conditions on how Apple Pay should be used in merchants’ apps and websites,” she says. “It also reserves the ‘tap and go’ functionality of iPhones to Apple Pay. It is important that Apple’s measures do not deny consumers the benefits of new payment technologies, including better choice, quality, innovation and competitive prices.”The post-Zoom worldA typically insightful and far-seeing essay by Benedict Evans on his blog about what happens once we’ve become accustomed to video-conferencing.Risky businessA lovely blog post by Steven Sinofsky on the historical background to humans’ reluctance to take sensible precautions, such as wearing face masks.

She starred in all three series of the BBC comedy W1A and in 2011 she won a Bafta for best supporting actress for her role as Rosemary West in Appropriate Adult. Next, Dolan plays Lorna in the new version of Alan Bennett’s Talking Heads, which airs on BBC One on Thursday 9 July and is on BBC iPlayer now.This is political satire that is second to none. Brooker takes us from the first moments we heard about coronavirus right up until the programme came out. He analyses the political and medical response to it. It’s not glib, it’s very layered. Somehow, he manages to do it without being insensitive. Oddly, it gave me a sort of security. We’re in the middle of this, so there isn’t any hindsight, so to have someone you’re familiar with, who’s so clever, be able to provide a bit of context and describe the situation in such an objective way is quite extraordinary, because it’s still all developing.The Encounter, by Simon McBurneyThe essence of theatre is that we are all in the same room and breathing the same air, which unfortunately we can’t do right now, but a show that really works online is The Encounter. It’s an absolutely mindblowing story about a photographer who gets stranded in the Amazon. McBurney works closely with the sound technicians and the show feels very live because he uses a binaural microphone to create different worlds. He’s giving you certain sounds into your right ear, and certain sounds into your left ear. You feel like the sound is going on all around you. It gives you the feeling of being immersed.Whenever you watch a music documentary, it teaches you so much about what was going on at the time. Music reacts in a very visceral way. There’s a wonderful part in this documentary with Rick Wakeman talking about when David Bowie first came to him with his 12-string guitar and said “Listen to this”, and started playing Life on Mars. It was so wonderful seeing Wakeman trying to remember the chords and explain why they were unusual and brilliant.The Square (directed by Ruben Östlund)This came out in 2017 and I don’t know why it didn’t win absolutely everything. It’s extremely funny. It’s the most fascinating film about trust and responsibility – the trust between a person making a work of art, the people displaying the work and the people receiving it. A notion I’m interested in is the animal in us, and what makes us civilised. Are we civilised or are we just sophisticated? That makes it not sound funny, but it’s brilliantly directed.

That will have suited the low-profile director just fine. A decade on, and at the moment of Liverpool’s title triumph, he was kept in the background again by UK quarantine rules that prevented the club’s Boston-based owners from witnessing in person the release of 30 years’ pent-up frustration. Not so fine.The Fenway Sports Group president is fixed behind the scenes at Liverpool, seemingly by circumstance as much as choice, but few have exerted greater influence in recent times than the man whose appointment was confirmed by Companies House 24 hours before irate fans confronted Roy Hodgson following a 2-0 defeat at Stoke.From New England Sports Ventures to FSG, the pervading threat of administration to world-record profits, gory under Hodgson to glory under Jürgen Klopp Liverpool are unrecognisable from the club fought over in the high court almost 10 years ago. Anfield itself now stands as a symbol of long overdue transformation.As the established face of FSG, the principal owner, John W Henry, merits rich praise for achieving with Liverpool what he accomplished with baseball’s Boston Red Sox in restoring a storied but tired institution to the pinnacle of its sport. Likewise the chairman, Tom Werner, the more public voice of a company that took a well-calculated risk when acquiring the club from the near-ruinous hands of Tom Hicks and George Gillett.But behind it all is the unassuming Gordon, a close Boston ally of Henry and Werner since they bought the Red Sox in 2002 and a Liverpool director with limited input during the muddled early years of FSG’s reign.In 2013, the financier closed a hedge fund he owned with Jeffrey Vinik, the owner of the Tampa Bay Lightning ice hockey team. The following year, his role at Liverpool increasing, he was elevated to FSG president and top of the decision-making process at Anfield. A turning point for all.The hiring of Klopp, the signing of Virgil van Dijk, the sale of Philippe Coutinho and investment in infrastructure are among major calls Gordon has judged perfectly. His biggest successes, however, ones that have shaped Liverpool’s present and long-term future, have been backing a sporting model over a promising manager and untapping the club’s vast commercial appeal while keeping the fans onside. The latter is a delicate balancing act that the occasional high-profile error has jeopardised.Gordon’s appointment as president did not immediately halt the mistakes and criticism that characterised FSG’s adaptation period. The flak intensified in 2014 when Luis Suárez was sold in the aftermath of the title slip and proceeds from his departure for £75m went on Mario Balotelli, Alberto Moreno, Lazar Markovic and Rickie Lambert, among others.Gordon, as those who work with him and his actions testify, is quick to learn from mistakes, to absorb information and make big decisions free of emotion, albeit while promoting strong personal relationships. That summer proved an invaluable education for the new FSG president and the beginning of the end for Brendan Rodgers as manager.Rodgers was overruled by Gordon and the then director of technical performance, Michael Edwards, when pushing for Wilfried Bony to replace Suárez. Twelve months later, they ceded to the manager’s request for Christian Benteke in the belief that, should the striker not succeed, his value would hold in the English market. Benteke was sold for £27m to Crystal Palace 13 months after his arrival from Aston Villa for £32.5m.A series of expensive failures fuelled the clamour outside Anfield for Liverpool to scrap their “transfer committee”. Gordon, part of the recruitment team, ignored the pressure, convinced the problem was not FSG’s model but having a manager ill-suited to it. Edwards, whom Gordon decided should run the football operation, was promoted to technical director in August 2015. Rodgers was sacked two months later.The dismissal was not entirely results-driven. It was also a strategic call to clear the way for a manager comfortable with FSG’s system. The attraction of the charismatic Klopp, a two-times Bundesliga-winner, was obvious, and Gordon was sold on Rodgers’s replacement after making his first call to the holidaying coach. But part of the appeal was the 14 years Klopp had worked alongside a sporting director in Germany. Klopp’s relationship with Edwards, promoted to sporting director by Gordon in November 2016, is central to Liverpool’s revival, but not at the exclusion of the FSG president.The 55-year-old Gordon remains based with his family in Boston, where he moved from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as a student and made his name and fortune as a financial investor. Yet his involvement in the day-to-day running of Liverpool is forensic. Gordon speaks with Edwards, the chief executive, Peter Moore, club officials and Klopp on a daily basis.It is several times a day to Klopp, with whom he has developed a close friendship and working relationship. Contrasting personalities but a meeting of minds. Gordon stayed at Klopp’s home after flying in to seal the manager’s new five-year contract in December. Attempts to do so incognito were derailed when his private jet skidded off the runway at Liverpool John Lennon airport.Klopp wants lucrative pre-season tours kept to a minimum to maximise what little time is available for a training camp. Thanks to Gordon’s sway with fellow investors in FSG, Klopp gets his way. Not every manager of a global club has that luxury.It was Gordon who smoothed relations at boardroom level between Liverpool and Southampton following the former’s aborted move for Van Dijk in the summer of 2017. Klopp, Edwards and Gordon agreed not to sign an alternative central defender despite Southampton refusing to negotiate over their primary target and reporting Liverpool to the Premier League over an alleged illegal approach. Six months on, and communication reopened with St Mary’s, the three were more than happy to meet the £75m price for a player who would transform Liverpool.Sanctioning Coutinho’s sale to Barcelona for £142m, the third-highest fee of all-time, and not buying last summer in the belief the European champions had more to give also reflect sound judgment at the top of the club.Klopp’s impact has helped the FSG president oversee another significant feat – maximising revenue without alienating a majority of supporters. Anfield is a more commercial stadium than ever, with double the number of corporate seats (7,000) in the new main stand. There have been 17 new commercial partnerships signed in the past two financial years and in 2017-18 Liverpool posted a world record pre-tax profit by a football club of £125m.In less successful times, with less popular managers, the connection between club and fans that Klopp strived to rebuild from day one would have been undermined by such commercialism. Even with Klopp it has been challenged by several spectacular own goals, not least April’s decision to furlough about 200 non-playing staff. The move was abandoned 48 hours later following fierce criticism from former players and supporters.The episode echoed proposals to increase £59 tickets to £77 in 2016 and a U-turn within 24 hours after fans staged a mass walkout against Sunderland. Attempts to trademark the word “Liverpool” ignited similar accusations of corporate greed and fan protests before the application was rejected last year.Overall, however, supporters are more engaged with the club, and vice-versa, than for years. The open dialogue between the hierarchy and the Spirit of Shankly supporters’ union over the furlough and ticketing controversies is testament to that and to what can be achieved. Gordon recognised the need to work closer with a global fanbase. It was his decision to appoint Liverpool’s first fan liaison officer, the former Times journalist Tony Barrett, having seen the role at work in Germany and questioned why such a critical gap existed in England.With the £114m main stand opened in 2016, a new £50m training complex due for completion in Kirkby in the coming months and plans for a £60m redevelopment of the Anfield Road stand, FSG has committed to the three most expensive capital projects in Liverpool’s history. Gordon has been instrumental in each, although the Anfield Road scheme has been postponed for 12 months because of the pandemic’s impact on the construction industry.There was reluctance inside FSG to proceed with the Anfield Road rebuild as the return on investment is not as attractive as that from the main stand. Its president not only pushed for the redevelopment but, having witnessed the 750,000 crowd that welcomed Liverpool home as European champions last summer, he was the driving force behind scrapping the original plans for a more ambitious expansion.Gordon’s decisions have strengthened Liverpool’s future and illuminated its present. He would prefer to go about his business unnoticed but his contribution should not go unheralded."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/979db42ecd71c9e085e572b49a0426807a16bcff/0_172_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23f2064f1d8b56035b3fddc1e40cfc64","title":"norwich manchester united fa cup match report","story":"With 117 minutes gone and the score 1-1, Harry Maguire leapt for a header in the Norwich City box and was bumped to the ground. Manchester United’s centre back had barely got to his feet before he was down again, writhing and stretching to poke a loose ball across the goalline after Paul Pogba had crossed back into a crush of exhausted human flesh.Norwich, down to 10 men, had no time to restart their engines. As the final whistle blew both sets of players sank to the Carrow Road turf. A round of weary hugs commemorated the fact United had won this FA Cup quarter-final 2-1, and deservedly so on the balance of a slow-burn muddle of a game.It was a struggle at times, and not just for both sets of players. Over the 120 minutes United had 36 shots at goal, 28 of them off target, many brilliantly saved by Tim Krul. They made six substitutions, a first in English football. For the final 25 minutes they had four strikers on the pitch, plus the Pogba-Fernandes creative axis. Still, though, this felt like football played through a mist.In the first half it took 43 minutes for either team to muster something close to a shot on target, as Todd Cantwell produced a neat little swivel to feed Lukas Rupp, whose shot was well blocked by Maguire.The lassitude was understandable. Name something stranger than a Premier League game in an empty stadium in late June. How about an FA Cup quarter-final in an empty stadium in late June?At kick-off Carrow Road had seemed a gentle place in the evening sunshine, with a sense of somnolence around the empty seats that seemed to transmit itself to both sets of players.There were other factors, too. United made eight changes: sensible given the flood of games, but a note of disappointment for those intrigued by the growing fluency of United’s attacking play. For Norwich, Cantwell and Teemu Pukki returned, a pleasant surprise for the dear old FA Cup, restored here to the status of A-list competition.Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata combined nicely early on. Jamal Lewis began with a sense of long-striding adventure down the Norwich right. But steadily the red shirts settled into a pattern of stodgy lateral passing. Fred saw a lot of the ball, although this didn’t always feel like the kind of relationship the ball’s closest friends would necessarily encourage. “Keep moving it,” a voice shouted from the touchline as Maguire doodled around in midfield.It was left to the drinks break to provide a rare show of animation as Daniel Farke, dressed in a shiny black plastic raincoat, pounded his fist and demanded greater urgency. Soon afterwards Kenny McLean robbed Juan Mata, rumbled forward and smashed a shot high on to the plastic sheets behind the goal.It was that kind of first half. For long periods nothing happened energetically. In between, nothing happened more slowly. The break seemed to come as a relief to both teams.And six minutes after half time something did finally happen, as United opened the scoring. Luke Shaw made the incision, driving down the right and crossing at chest-height. Mata seemed to produce a clever touch over two Norwich defenders, although replays showed the ball came off Max Aarons. Odion Ighalo had been left unmarked. He flicked it into the net past Tim Krul with the outside of his foot, an easy, expert finish.This was Ighalo’s fifth United goal, all of them in cup competitions. He has been a shrewd hire, a smart, experienced player to do exactly this kind of job.The goal brought a surge of energy from Norwich, who should have scored just after the hour. Ben Godfrey somehow cleared the ball off the United line with his shoulder after a low free-kick from Emi Buendía was glanced on by Bruno Fernandes.Steadily Norwich began to pass and move with some fluency and on 75 minutes Cantwell produced a fine equaliser. Onel Hernández laid the ball inside and Cantwell’s shot zinged into the bottom corner.There was time for a final twist. Brandon Williams, on as a sub, produced a fine goal-saving tackle on Hernández. And on 88 minutes Timm Klose was faced with a similar moment of danger but could only conjure a ludicrous bear hug on Ighalo as he  away. Ighalo would have been in on goal. Klose was rightly sent off. The free-kick from Fernandes was scuffed low into the wall.By now United had Pogba and Rashford on, along with Fernandes and Greenwood, an ominous prospect for an undermanned home team. At the death Krul made a miraculous double save, first from Pogba then Greenwood. United duly dominated extra time but without creating any really clear chances – right up until Maguire’s act of euthanasia at the death.“It was a difficult game and we made hard work of it,” the match-winner told the BBC. “We weren’t at our best and sometimes in cup games that happens. You’ve got to find a way to go on and get the victory and get through to the next round and we’ve managed it in the end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db2809d57749fbb50040b1f50c1fc916ec1dfc5b/0_541_7216_4330/master/7216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70684c644b43e3fbd285611aacf44ae6","title":"parents can look foetus real time artificial wombs future","story":"Scientists are currently pushing on an ethical boundary. Will out of body gestation ever replace the experience of human birth?The lamb is sleeping. It lies on its side, eyes shut, ears folded back and twitching. It swallows, wriggles and shuffles its gangly legs. Its crooked half-smile makes it look content, as if dreaming about gambolling in a grassy field. But this lamb is too tiny to venture out. Its eyes cannot open. It is hairless its skin gathers in pink rolls at its neck. It hasn’t been born yet, but here it is, at 111 days’ gestation, totally separate from its mother, alive and kicking in a research lab in Philadelphia. It is submerged in fluid, floating inside a transparent plastic bag, its umbilical cord connected to a nexus of bright blood-filled tubes. This is a foetus growing inside an artificial womb. In another four weeks, the bag will be unzipped and the lamb will be born.When I first see images of the Philadelphia lambs on my laptop, I think of the foetus fields in The Matrix, where motherless babies are farmed in pods on an industrial scale. But this is not a substitute for full gestation. The lambs didn’t grow in the bags from conception they were taken from their mothers’ wombs by caesarean section, then submerged in the Biobag, at a gestational age equivalent to 23-24 weeks in humans. This isn’t a replacement for pregnancy yet, but it is certainly the beginning.The team who made these artificial wombs say they are driven only by the desire to save the most vulnerable humans on Earth. Emily Partridge, Marcus Davey and Alan Flake are neonatologists, developmental physiologists and surgeons who work with extremely premature babies at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). After three years of tweaking, their latest prototype is designed to give babies born too soon a greater chance of survival than ever before.The Biobag was born into public consciousness in April 2017, when the CHOP team published their research in the journal Nature Communications. They had found a way to gestate sheep foetuses outside maternal bodies foetuses that would eventually become lambs no different from those that had grown in ewes’ wombs. (Sheep are the go-to animals in obstetric research because they have a long gestation period and the foetuses are around the same size as ours.)Their invention consists of a replacement placenta: an oxygenator plugged into the lamb’s umbilical cord, which also removes carbon dioxide and delivers nutrients. Blood is pumped entirely by the beating of the foetus’s heart, just as it would be in the womb. The bag acts like an amniotic sac filled with warm, sterile, lab-made fluid that the lamb breathes and swallows, just as a human foetus would.CHOP’s communications department released a very slick short film, Recreating The Womb, to coincide with the paper’s release. There is not a foetus in sight. Instead there are neat diagrams of lambs in Biobag systems, slightly awkward footage of Partridge, Flake and Davey pretending to do lambless lamb research in a pristine lab and heartbreaking clips of impossibly small super-premature babies. Then there are carefully edited interviews with the team. “In the future, we envision the system will be in the neonatal intensive care unit and will look pretty much like a traditional incubator,” Davey says. The Biobags would be kept in a darkened environment to mimic the human womb, but the babies would be visible as never before: “Parents can actually look at their foetus in real time,” Flake adds.Normal human pregnancy is 40 weeks any baby born before 37 weeks is considered premature. The 23-24-week period is the border of viability, after which modern medicine currently has a hope of keeping babies alive, and doctors will attempt to resuscitate a newborn. To the NHS, a baby born dead at 24 weeks is classed as a stillbirth, whereas a dead baby born at 23 weeks and six days is a miscarriage. It is a brutal boundary.Incubators deal with some of the functions a premature newborn needs help with, but they don’t allow for the process of gestation to continue the Biobag does, treating the baby as a foetus who has not yet been born. Women at risk of going into very early labour could have their babies transferred into an artificial womb. It sounds extreme, but if it could mean a healthy future instead of illness and disability, who could deny it to them?The CHOP researchers want their device to be seen as ethically unremarkable. “Our goal is not to extend the limits of viability, but to offer the potential for improved outcomes for those infants already being routinely resuscitated,” their paper says. Extending the current limits of a foetus’s viability would create an ethical minefield. The legal abortion limit in the UK was brought down from 28 to 24 weeks in 1990 because advances in neonatal care meant foetuses born then were more likely to live. If artificial wombs help ever smaller babies survive, that could have profound implications for women. But women are not mentioned in CHOP’s work.The application to patent the Biobag, filed in 2014, is revealing. There’s no coyness about extending the limits of human viability here: it explicitly says possible “subjects” include “pre-viable foetuses (eg 20–24 weeks)”.I am not allowed to go to Philadelphia to see the team’s work. I so nearly was: Flake told me I was welcome, and we fixed a date. But then I was suddenly unwelcome. They want to be able to put human babies inside the Biobag within a couple of years, and the prospect of my visit had made the legal department twitchy. “There is a lot of caution to do anything that could jeopardise FDA approval,” a press officer told me.“This is not a new field,” says Matt Kemp, wearily. He runs the perinatal lab at the Women \u0026amp Infants Research Foundation (WIRF) in Western Australia, and his team’s artificial womb, Ex-Vivo Uterine Environment or EVE therapy, reported its first great successes in a paper published a few months after CHOP’s. The Biobag stole EVE’s thunder, and though Kemp makes little reference to it, he does sound somewhat narked.“The Karolinska Institute in Sweden published a paper in 1958 showing the use of this sort of platform with pre-viable human foetuses,” he says. “Groups in Canada in the early 60s experimented with sheep using this system. As early as 1963, the Japanese did seminal work in the field... Anyone who tells you they have done this for the first time is being disingenuous.” He doesn’t name names.There is no patent application for EVE (“It’s not patentable,” Kemp says, exasperated, “this has all been in the public domain since 1958”), so he is happy to answer questions – unless they are about the reason he decided to name his artificial womb after the first woman and the mother of mankind. He doesn’t want to get drawn into discussions about the symbolism of his work: “It was just a convenient way of describing it, I guess.”Kemp has been developing EVE since 2013, with researchers at Tohoku University hospital in Sendai, Japan. No official images have been released, but I found a YouTube video uploaded to the WIRF channel. It looked as if it wasn’t supposed to be online (and has since been removed): it was clearly filmed on a phone and had had only 56 views in a year. After CHOP’s carefully sanitised images, this 44-second clip made my jaw drop.It begins with beeping monitors in a neonatal intensive care unit a healthy heartbeat thumping in red on a black screen. The camera pans to an incubator beside it and instead of a baby there is a lamb, its chest rising and falling, lying in yellowish fluid in a transparent bag from which protrudes a mass of tubes, like veins filled with blood. This is what an artificial womb really looks like.The big difference between the work of WIRF and CHOP is the age of the lambs. The youngest foetus put into the Biobag was 106 days EVE’s was 95. Kemp is cautious about translating this into human terms, but it’s between 21 and 23 weeks. No one else has ever reported working with foetuses this young. And while CHOP grew their lambs for several weeks, often to term, and let some live, Kemp’s team kept them in the artificial womb for a week, then killed all of them to analyse their organs. He says they could easily have kept them alive for longer: “These are stable, healthy animals.”Even in a week, the lambs change dramatically, putting on weight and flexing and swallowing. “I’ve never been pregnant,” Kemp says, “but my wife says a foetus does those movements. It kicks, has a wee wiggle and goes back to sleep.”But clinical trials involving human babies are a long way off. “Anyone who tells you they are going to be doing this in two years either has a wealth of data that is not in the public domain or is being a bit sensationalist.”Is he talking about anyone in particular?“I am not,” he says firmly. “All the experiments to date have been done on foetuses that come from healthy pregnancies. That’s simply not the case for a 21- or 22-week human foetus. These are not going to be healthy babies. Getting this into clinical use is going to be incredibly difficult. To create an argument an ethical committee will buy, you’ve got to have an odds-on chance of delivering an outcome far better than the technology currently in use,” he says. “What is the likely first demographic? A very sick 21-week foetus.”This floors me. I lost a baby at 20 weeks – a son, who would have been my second child. There was nothing wrong with him. He was perfect. I got appendicitis when I was nearly 19 weeks pregnant. I spent a week in hospital while obstetricians and gynaecologists scanned and poked, trying to work out why I was ill. And then I went into labour. It happens: if you are pregnant, a serious infection can cause your cervix to open. In between contractions, the obstetrician told me if I had been 24 weeks pregnant, everything would have been different. Even though my son was a proper baby, who was wrapped up and given to me to hold, he died while I was giving birth to him. A miscarriage, not a stillbirth.This happened three years ago. Since then, I’ve had my appendix out, and had a daughter. But, like anyone who has lost a baby, I will always be haunted by what could have been done differently. If an artificial womb might save the life of a very sick 21-week-old foetus, could it also save a 20-week-old who was perfectly healthy, but unlucky enough to be inside a woman who was ill?I swallow hard. “If the first time you put a human foetus in your system,” I say, “it will be one not viable otherwise, questions will come up about pushing the boundaries of viability. Can’t you imagine parents of even more premature babies wanting their child to have any chance an artificial womb might offer?”“This is a really easy question,” he says. “This is a human – or a foetus, or a baby – that’s sick. If you had a three-year-old that was unwell and somebody was developing a new therapy, would you have any qualms about that?”“So there you go. From our perspective, this is no different.”In other words, so long as they have a chance to save a baby’s life, they will try to do it. But there are limits.“We don’t think we are shifting the border of viability further and further: if you can’t get a catheter in and the heart is not sufficiently developed to drive blood through the system, it’s not going to work. So any concerns about harvesting eggs and putting them into these artificial devices are completely abrogated by that. It’s just not practically possible.”As we get better at extending the lives of embryos outside the womb, and keeping ever more premature babies alive, there will come a time when those two points meet. The obstacles will be legal and ethical, not technological. IVF was once science fiction, then an ethical conundrum, then the cutting edge of assisted reproduction. Now it’s a normal part of making families. Once bags and tubes can replace a womb, pregnancy and birth will be fundamentally redefined. If gestation no longer has to take place inside a woman’s body, it will no longer be female. And the meaning of motherhood will also be changed, for ever.“Pregnancy is barbaric,” Dr Anna Smajdor declares. “If there were any disease that caused the same problems, we would regard it as very serious.” I am sitting in her office at the University of Oslo, opposite a calendar featuring photographs of her cats. She is a bioethicist and associate professor of practical philosophy, but has the air of a mischievous teenager.“The number of women who suffer tears and incontinence, and things that damage them for the rest of their lives is really high, yet it’s not adequately recognised,” she continues. “This is all tied up with the strong value we attach not just to motherhood, but to giving birth.”I’ve been eager to meet Smajdor since I read her groundbreaking academic papers on artificial wombs. She argues that ectogenesis – reproduction outside the human body – would allow reproductive labour to be redistributed fairly in society, so there is a moral imperative for more research.“There’s an unquestioned assumption that women will have babies, and a failure to notice how bizarre it is that we have to produce new human beings out of our own bodies. And how dangerous that is.”To demonstrate her point, she tells me about a colleague having a wisdom tooth out. Smajdor suggested they film it, as a beautiful experience to savour: “Here it comes! And look, here’s the stitching! Wow – you did that without any painkillers!”The comparison is completely perverse, but I can see her point. Our attitude to birth is very strange. There is blood, pain and stitching even if it all goes well, and we are meant to ignore it. Maternal mortality and stillbirth rates are going down globally, but Smajdor says that isn’t necessarily all good news. “The more medicine advances, the more women get scathed. I see a trajectory towards knowing so much about the foetus, and what’s good or bad for it, that women become almost ectogenetic gestators themselves, their whole function about maximising what’s good for the baby.”I have definitely felt like an ectogenetic gestator. I have had to lie back while a 20cm needle was plunged into my belly so doctors could extract my son’s DNA because something on a scan made them think he might have Down’s syndrome. (He didn’t, but then I got appendicitis.) I have had to stop myself from gagging while forcing down a cloying glucose concoction because a late scan of my daughter showed I might have gestational diabetes. (I didn’t.) I have had to lie with my legs clamped apart while a surgeon stitched up my cervix because a scan showed I was at risk of going into another early labour. Being pregnant is a remarkable experience, and I loved carrying my first child, but I have never felt more like a thing, being acted upon purely because my very dedicated doctors knew too much about what might be going on inside me.Smajdor was “not very surprised” when she saw CHOP’s lambs. “Those people were clever in their – ” she chooses the word carefully – “marketing. And, of course, being unwilling to talk about ectogenesis is part of the PR approach.” Instead of pouring resources into saving premature babies, she says we should be growing them in artificial wombs from the start, “because it’s a trauma for the foetus, being removed from the uterus, even if it then goes into a Biobag and survives”.Smajdor uses provocative ideas to raise difficult questions. It works: she has made me think about how messed up our notions of what “normal” childbirth, pregnancy and motherhood are.If perfect ectogenesis could ever exist, there is a long list of women who would want to use it: women with epilepsy, bipolar disorder or cancer, for whom pregnancy would mean risking either their own or their foetuses’ lives by stopping or starting medication women who have had their wombs removed for medical reasons. Ectogenesis will also help women in circumstances much less likely to attract public sympathy: social surrogacy clients and older women, whose male equivalents have babies without a thought. You could conceive an embryo while you’re young and grow it in a bag after you retire.But perhaps the people most likely to be emancipated by this technology are those not born female: single men, gay men and trans women desperate for their own biological children. I ask Smajdor about the benefits of ectogenesis for them.“I don’t support anyone’s right to have a child. I support people’s right not to have their body interfered with.” Then she leaves the world of philosophical logic for a moment. “Assuming we could get perfect ectogenesis, it seems like a thing we should do, in a fully just society. The problem is that our societies are not fully just. In a society that believes natural reproduction is the most amazing part of a woman’s life, ectogenesis is going to be very problematic, and more likely to be used in ways that are detrimental to women.”“What kind of ways?”“When we talk about rescuing very premature babies, there’s a risk of a desire to rescue babies because their mother is not fit to carry the foetus,” Smajdor says. Across the world, inappropriate behaviour during pregnancy is increasingly viewed as child abuse. Since the 50s, dozens of US states have prosecuted women for using drugs while pregnant. If you can save a baby from the dangers of premature birth, would you not be prepared to save it from a reckless mother? It’s easy to imagine a future where the kind of “help” already offered by employers in Silicon Valley and beyond, enabling staff to freeze their eggs so they can focus on their careers, might include the option to grow their babies in an artificial womb. Using a real womb, inside the body, could ultimately become a sign of poverty, of chaotic lives, of unplanned pregnancy, or of being a borderline-dangerous “freebirther”, choosing to have a baby without any medical input.The greatest existential threat faced by unborn babies today doesn’t come from women “unfit” to be pregnant, but from unwilling mothers. Once a woman’s body is no longer the incubator, abortion can be both pro-choice and pro-life. In the ectogenetic future, foetuses aborted by mothers who didn’t want them to exist could be “rescued” and adopted. In that world, some women might seek out backstreet abortions that would end their babies’ lives, rather than legal ones that would allow them to live. It’s a horrifying thought. But it could happen if the foetus’s right to life trumps that of a woman to refuse to become a mother.Artificial wombs will be an incredibly powerful new technology. How that power will manifest itself depends on who is demanding, making, controlling and paying for the technology. Once IVF became mainstream, research into treating fertility problems such as blocked fallopian tubes all but stopped. Why bother, if the problem can be circumvented by assisted reproduction? The same could happen with research that makes it easier and safer for women to have babies without being sliced, probed and torn. What’s the point, if the solution is already there?Women gain so much more than we lose by bearing children: the creative power of being a mother, the right to choose whether to become a parent at all. Can the freedom to have babies without being pregnant be worth sacrificing any of this?Full ectogenesis will not exist for decades, but artificial wombs are coming. We need to ensure that, when they do arrive, it’s in a society that values women for more than just their reproductive capacity, and that they are put to use for the benefit of people who can’t be pregnant for biological rather than social reasons. We do still have time. But the race to innovate means maybe not enough.“This certainly is a project that would have sounded more like science fiction,” Emily Partridge says at the end of the CHOP video. “But over three years of doggedly pursuing it, it has become very real.” • This is an edited extract from Sex Robots \u0026amp Vegan Meat: Adventures At The Frontier Of Birth, Food, Sex \u0026amp Death, by Jenny Kleeman, published on 9 July by Picador at £16.99.

She soon found it was the perfect gameplanPeople process change in different ways. It is discomfiting to realise just how little control we have over the direction our lives can take. A day passes, a disease we never even knew existed strikes, and the world is suddenly changed. In its face, some turn spiritual. Some turn philosophical. Some turn to the hardest science they can in search of some semblance of ordered explanation. I turned in a direction I would never have previously imagined, to a pursuit that had not only never caught my interest but that I was only vaguely aware even existed: poker.The more I think about the nature of luck, the more I realise just how big a hand it has had in every single aspect of my existence. As a child, I had perhaps the greatest luck of my life: my parents left the Soviet Union, opening to me a world of opportunity I would never otherwise have had. The sheer, beautiful chance of it all! Just imagine, for a second, if they had stayed. How different my entire subsequent existence would be. As a teen, I used every ounce of skill I had to excel academically and become part of the first generation in my family to make it to college in the United States – but, oh, the luck involved in getting into that college in the first place. How many people who’d worked just as hard as I did would never make it that far because of a happenstance of birth or a quirk of the admissions committee? Just how much of my life could I take credit for, and how much was just simple dumb luck?For a long time, it was a philosophical question more than anything. But in 2015, the problem of skill versus chance became more personally pressing. In the first week of January, my mother – my role model in almost every way – lost her job of almost 20 years, summarily downsized in a private equity acquisition. A few months later, my vivacious, healthy, living-on-her-own grandmother slipped in the night. The edge of a metal bed frame. Hard linoleum floor. No extra pair of ears to hear anything amiss. The neighbours found her in the morning, alerted by a light that shouldn’t have been turned on. Two days later, she was dead. We never said goodbye. She’d been through World War II, survived Stalin, Khrushchev, Gorbachev, and was defeated by a slippery floor and one misplaced foot. Unfair. Or rather, unlucky. One surer step and she’d still be here.My husband lost his job next. The startup he’d joined failed to start up as planned and, with that, I momentarily found myself in a position I hadn’t been in for years: supporting my family on a freelance writer’s income. We left our beautiful apartment. We changed our habits. We did our best to adjust. And on top of it all, I found my health suddenly failing. I’d recently been diagnosed with a bizarre autoimmune condition. No one knew quite what it was, but my hormone levels had declared insanity and I was suddenly allergic to just about everything. Sometimes, I couldn’t even leave the apartment: my skin broke out in hives whenever anything touched it, and it was winter outside. I sat huddled over my laptop, draped in an old, loose T-shirt, hoping for the best. I went from expert to expert, steroid regime to steroid regime, only to be told the same thing: idiopathic – doctor-speak for “We don’t have a clue.”Unfair. Bum luck. But was it? Maybe it had been my fault for failing to listen to my mother and sneaking out to play on the balcony so many years ago. I was born in Russia, after all, and was there for Chernobyl – my mother’s warning to stay inside had its reasons. Maybe my two-year-old self was to blame. I sat reading James Salter – “We cannot imagine these diseases, they are called idiopathic, spontaneous in origin, but we know instinctively there must be something more, some invisible weakness they are exploiting. It is impossible to think they fall at random, it is unbearable to think it” – and I found myself nodding in recognition. Whether it was pure chance or not, it sucked.Never could I have imagined that I’d seek out any life answers in a game. What can a deck of cards really teach you about the uncertainty of existence? But poker, it turns out, is a game unlike most others. It isn’t the roulette wheel of pure chance, nor is it the chess of mathematical elegance and perfect information. Like the world we inhabit, it consists of both. At its heart, poker is a game of incomplete information. There’s the information I hold in private (my hole cards, known only to me) there’s the information everyone knows (the community cards that are dealt face up on the table) and there’s the information that I can start to guess at but can never know for sure (the cards of every other player). How can I make the best decision possible, given what I know, what I don’t know, and what I can guess at? How do I make that decision with confidence, knowing that I can never be completely certain that I’m right – and that even if I am, the remaining cards in the deck might go against me, rendering my correct decision seemingly useless in the face of an unfortunate outcome? Anyone can get lucky – or unlucky – at a single hand, a single game, a single tournament. One turn and you’re on top of the world – another, you are cast out, no matter your skill, training, preparation, aptitude. In the end, though, luck is a short-term friend or foe. Skill shines through over the longer time horizon. Provided, of course, you survive long enough to get there.Life is messy. It can’t ever be mapped cleanly. Every day consists of making the best decisions you can from information that can never be complete. Poker is a way to conceptualize the mess, clean its parameters just enough to allow you to grapple with uncertainty with some semblance of control. You never know someone else’s mind, just like you can never know any poker hand but your own–but you can do your best with what you have.As I learned more about the game, I began to genuinely wonder if, in poker, I could finally find a way to overcome my all-too-human inability to disentangle chance from skill in the morass of daily life and instead learn to master it. For two years I spent almost every waking moment in the game. When I wasn’t playing it, I was studying it. I travelled to the edges of reason, swapping the hallways of Manhattan magazines for the gambling dens of Macau. To the me of a year earlier, my life would look entirely unrecognisable. Who is this person spending eight months of the year on planes and in casinos? Who is this person, poring over strange matrices of cards on her computer, talking about game theory this and expected value that, instead of nodding her head as a scientist explains the latest theory about the human mind and talking through the ideal structure of a sentence with her editors? And isn’t it strange that the only reading material I can consistently spy under her arm is…what is that? A book of poker strategy?I didn’t just learn the rules of the game. I learned about the intricacies of my own psyche. I learned about the pitfalls of my decision making. About the way I let people bully me because I was afraid of seeming anything other than nice. But what I learned above all is how to rise above the noise: how to embrace uncertainty rather than fear it, reframing the very thing that once petrified me – my utter lack of control over certain key elements of my life – into something that I could instead use as a source of power.I remember well the conversation that was, in a way, responsible for the change. It takes me back to Las Vegas, in the early days of my poker journey, the winter of 2017. I’d just come this close to clinching my first ever tournament cash when an unlucky run of cards rendered me the bubble girl – that is, the last person eliminated from the tournament before everyone else is guaranteed to come away with a profit. How unfair! I couldn’t wait to tell every detail of how I’d been robbed of my rightful victory to my coach, Erik Seidel – one of the legends of the poker world. Surely, he would empathise. After all, he’d been playing poker for more than three decades. “Stop,” he said, when I hadn’t even done with the part about having my shove called after flopping the nines. I stopped, a bit confused. We haven’t even got to the good (or, rather, bad) bit. And it’s very unlike Erik to cut me off. He’s one of the best listeners I know. I look at him expectantly. “Do you have a question about how you played the hand?” he asked.“Well, not really,” I answered. “I mean, I had a set…”“I don’t want to hear it.”I was taken aback. Isn’t it the place of a coach to listen to his student – not tell her he doesn’t want to hear it?Well, that certainly got the point across. But wasn’t I allowed to vent just a bit?As it turned out, no, no I wasn’t.“Focus on the process, not the luck. Did I play correctly? Everything else is just BS in our heads,” Erik tells me. “Thinking that way won’t get you anywhere. You know about the randomness of it but it doesn’t help to think about it. You want to make sure you’re not the person in the poker room saying, ‘Can you believe what happened?’ That’s the other people.” he said.I hadn’t quite thought of it that way, but the words hit home. That was the moment I realised just how much poker might teach me about one of the single most important tools in our mental arsenal: emotional resilience. How we frame something affects not just our thinking but our emotional state. It may seem a small deal, but the words we select – the ones we filter out and the ones we eventually choose to put forward – are a mirror to our thinking.The language we use becomes our mental habits – and our mental habits determine how we learn, how we grow, what we become. It’s not just a question of semantics: telling bad beat stories matters. Our thinking about luck has real consequences in terms of our emotional wellbeing, our decisions, and the way we implicitly view the world and our role in it. There is no such thing as objective reality. Every time we experience something, we interpret it for ourselves. How we phrase sentences can determine whether we have an internal or external locus of control, whether we are masters of our fates or peons of forces beyond us. Do we see ourselves as victims or victors? A victim: the cards went against me. Things are being done to me, things are happening around me, and I am neither to blame nor in control. A victor: I made the correct decision. Sure, the outcome didn’t go my way, but I thought correctly under pressure. And that’s the skill I can control.The repercussions of that frame shift are worth considering. In poker, if you’re one of the bad-beat dwellers, you can still just hop into the next tournament and regale the table with talk of the unfairness of the poker gods. If you suffer a bad beat in life, it may set you back considerably more, and last a lot longer. All of a sudden, your framing matters. A victim of the cruel cards? This may serve as something I think of as a luck-dampener effect: because you’re wallowing in your misfortune, you fail to see the things you could be doing to overcome it. Potential opportunities pass you by people get tired of hearing you complain, so your social network of support and opportunities also dwindles you don’t even attempt certain activities because you think, I’ll lose anyway, why try? Your mental health suffers and the spiral continues.What if you think of yourself instead as an almost- victor who thought correctly and did everything possible but was foiled by crap variance? No matter: you will have other opportunities, and if you keep thinking correctly, eventually it will even out. These are the seeds of resilience, of being able to overcome the bad beats that you can’t avoid and mentally position yourself to be prepared for the next time. People share things with you: if you’ve lost your job, your social network thinks of you when new jobs come up if you’re recently orced or separated or bereaved, and someone single who may be a good match pops up, you’re top of mind. That attitude is what I think of as a luck amplifier. Sure, you can’t actually change the cards, but you will feel a whole lot happier and better adjusted while you take life’s blows, and your ready mindset will prepare you for the change in variance that will come at some point, even if that point is far in the future.Poker has given me many things. Better decision making abilities. A better understanding of probabilistic thinking, the nature of chance, the nature of incomplete information. A way of dealing with the things out of my control, of making peace with the elements of my life that simply won’t be reined in. It has even helped my husband turn his job loss into a job gain: not a loss, but an opportunity to do what he’s always wanted, start his own business. But this – this may be its greatest gift of all. The gift of the no-bad-beat mindset. The ability to move on from the inevitable bad beats that life throws in my direction – because I know that I have no ability to change the runout of the cards.What I can change are the circumstances around that runout. How I react. How I respond. How I move on. Forget the bad beat, and make a concrete plan of action that I can execute, on how to make such bad beats less likely in the future. How can I craft a table environment where the bad beats are limited? How can I survive the runouts that don’t go my way, and still think clearly on the other side? This, in the end, may be poker’s biggest life lesson.The Biggest Bluff: How I Learned to Pay Attention, Master Myself, and Win by Maria Konnikova (HarperCollins, £20) is out now.

And all three are now destined for British TV screens.“I’d imagined my films might reach just a few people, but they’ve gone mad and now I have the added interest of television production companies,” said Chawawa, whose skits range from spoof rap songs and comic characters, including reporter Barty Crease, to political parody.For Cotter, when he posted the first of his comic films, the response was so overwhelming he is now one step away from being anointed a national treasure. He already has the more concrete bonus of a lucrative book deal.Mabel and Olive remain unruffled, however. “They have kept an even doggy keel through it all. Dogs are dogs and that’s the great pleasure of them. In fact, we are probably all leaning on our dogs more than usual.”Lockdown has also shaken up the world of Joel, who is now developing a comedy pilot on the strength of his funny posts about the world of theatre, where he works as a successful freelance choreographer.“My first film got around 25,000 hits in 24 hours. And people got back to me saying it was the first time they had smiled in a month. Then a TV production company said they would be interested in using my characters to make a mockumentary,” said Joel, 32.For Foster, 26, the slog of looking for work after drama school was a challenge. But an inspired move into lip-syncing sketches on the social media site TikTok has altered everything. “I’m just deciding which is the best agency to sign with for what I want to do. I am interested in working on my own show, ideally,” she said.Living in lockdown back with her parents in Bampton, Oxfordshire, she staged a string of clever sketches, using topical soundtracks, including the voice of the home secretary Priti Patel. Witty editing has showcased her ability to play a succession of different characters.“It was not a plan. I was just keeping myself busy,” said Foster. “I’ve always loved impersonating people, and creating characters, but the profession is incredible tough and getting noticed seems impossible. Now I’ve taken things into my own hands.”The same is true for Chawawa, 27, a psychology graduate now based in south London: the last few weeks have underlined the power of taking charge of your own destiny. “I couldn’t cope with the feeling I couldn’t use my skills. I normally broadcast on the radio and I’d been doing sketches for a couple of years. It started with a parody of Jamie Oliver that took off when he was in trouble for his Caribbean jerk chicken recipe,” said Chawawa. “So I started making my own films again.“I hope my brand of comedy is thoughtful. I want to be a black entertainer who redefines it a bit, without being that loud, extrovert entertainer we are sometimes funnelled into becoming.”Harnessing the power of lockdown was more of an accident for Joel, who grew up in Truro, Cornwall. “I was at my home in week four of lockdown when I released little films of parodies of different characters on Twitter at four o’clock in the afternoon. I soon found people were waiting for them. It has all escalated from there.”He has been working on a pilot of his own comedy show with a production company and the script is ready to go when lockdown lifts. “There will be guest actors, but I am playing the main parts, so it is ideal for complying with social distancing, really,” he said.Cotter has watched fresh opportunities open up due to the broad appeal of his comic commentaries, and it has renewed his interest in film-making.“It has been one of the strange things about this new way of life,” he said, reflecting on the surge of international interest in him, prompted in part when the high-profile American basketball coach Steve Kerr first “liked” one of his online posts. “I had become so wedded to my sports, I had rather forgotten about film. This would normally be my busiest time, with just one week off between covering Queen’s tennis tournament and setting off to Wimbledon. Then I’d be off to Tokyo for the Olympics for the best part of a month. But I won’t regret missing it all. Dogs don’t live long enough and I will look back and think I am glad I did all that with them then.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0f6bf277254e4902df5bb46ede4f46f97f1fa23/0_50_5576_3345/master/5576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c75fc1bbbf8137a4a8eb66c848b7917b","title":"a new normal how has working from home been for you","story":"We’d like to hear from  readers for a video series about what’s next in the world of work In our video series, A new normal, we ask  readers what they want a future shaped by Covid-19 to look like.

That it would have been my first is for me is matter of some regret as I have spent a long career trying to shoot a mix of all things British, and in particular iconic British events. How I managed to miss this festival is almost beyond me, given its significance in the British social calendar. I do have an excuse though, as the last weekend of June is always the AGM of Magnum, the cooperative that I am a member of, and I always felt obliged and keen to attend.So for the 50th festival I had planned to go, but as we all know it was cancelled. However, I thought it would be interesting to tour the site just before the festival would have opened, to see how it looks.I am being taken around by John from the press office, and the first thing to remember is that this is a large, busy and working farm. I photograph Steven, the farm manager, cleaning his tractor, and there are nearby piles of manure, and in front of the skeleton of the Pyramid stage is a large herd of friesian cows where normally you would see many thousands of dancing, waving festivalgoers.The other first impression is that the site is huge. This will not be news to regular attendees, but to this Glasto virgin it amazing to see the scale of it all. We pass the staff canteen, which serves 20,000 meals a day we see assorted landmark sites like the Greenpeace boat and the stone circle. We visit a site called Permaculture, where John picks some raspberries: normally at this time of year it would be a thriving market garden.All around the site are remains of the assorted attractions waiting to be brought back to life in a year’s time. There is a sense of melancholy about the whole site.We go back to base and meet Emily, and a few moments later Michael comes by in his bright red Land Rover. He is a pretty nimble 85-year-old. I explain I have taken his photo a few times and say the last time was when he opened a summer fete at an old people’s home in nearby Shepton Mallet. He says: ‘That’s the sort of thing I do!’ I shoot their portrait in front of the door to one of the farm barns.The tour continues and I go to an area with dozens of skips and many refuse lorries, a reminder that at the festival peak this is a community of more than a quarter of a million people, with all the servicing this entails. There are piles of old oil barrels which are the litter bins, which are freshly painted every year but are now looking a bit sad. I go to the festival workshop barn, where Rob is employed year-round to build and maintain the festival infrastructure.I hope to be back next year, to see the real thing in full operation, but I am grateful to have had this chance to first see the lay of the land."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9d9cf4da5d280c1afda6bf7486a4096fba388db/0_519_3747_2248/master/3747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e316de287171bd1264d1cb96927feedf","title":"haim women in music pt iii review their most direct album yet","story":"(Polydor)Dark events of the sisters’ recent past inform their revelatory third album on which garage and louche funk combine with west-coast rockA certain lightness has always played about the work of Haim, the three multi-instrumentalist sisters from Los Angeles. Even as their two critically acclaimed albums, indebted to R\u0026ampB and soft rock, often riffed on romantic angst, a sense of effortlessness remained uppermost in the band’s sound. Like their most obvious lodestones, Fleetwood Mac, there was no topic that Haim’s retro harmonies could not turn into insouciant-sounding gold.Haim’s third album retains some of their perpetual glide. But this is a set in which everyone is dancing with tears in their eyes, and one where Haim’s pat affiliation to 70s west coast truisms undergoes some interesting seepage. More so than ever before, Haim venture outside their musical Hotel California, with jazz saxophone and UK garage beats heading up a lively new intake of sounds. Intermittent blasts of lurid electric guitar – witness the chorusing riffola on All That Ever Mattered – are there to underline the trio’s allegiance to rock music. The song’s treated banshee wails attest both to the band’s interest in fresh production textures and the need for a little primal scream therapy.Making Women in Music Pt III – WIMPIII or “wimpee” in short – the band were in some disarray. As they tell it, all three Haims were hit by post-tour comedown in 2018, a common enough affliction among musicians. Each also had a few couture demons of their own to wrangle.Doctors warned Este Haim she may have to change career, as touring was wreaking havoc with her type 1 diabetes. Alana Haim had still not properly grieved her best friend, lost in a car crash in 2012, just before the band went on tour to support their first album. Here, the country-leaning Hallelujah – a song on which each sister sings a verse – finds Alana remembering her late pal while her sisters express their gratitude for each other.While Summer Girl – Haim’s inspired rewrite of Lou Reed’s Walk on the Wild Side, first released almost a year ago – offered Rechtshaid bleary sunshine and “unconditional love”, a further trio of thoughtful, low-key songs take a deep e into Danielle’s own dark places. Two are among the tracks already released during this album’s long period of Covid limbo WIMPIII was announced for spring, then delayed till late summer, then brought forward. I Know Alone, with its two-step beat and Joni Mitchell reference, and Now I’m in It (electronic pop, elegiac middle eight) are both fine additions to the canon of sad bangers.I’ve Been Down, meanwhile, is a minor revelation looser, rattlier and more intimate than the majority of Haim songs, with speaking roles for a saxophone and discreet piano lines. Danielle half-raps lines such as “The love of my life sleeping by my side, but I’m still down.”Women in Music Pt III gives vent to other feelings, too. The album’s cover shot finds Haim in their local deli – they played an early gig there – framed by a range of fat, dangling salamis. The title, meanwhile, rolls its eyes at the question few female musicians relish being asked: “How does it feel to be a woman in music”? Channelling both Joni Mitchell and her millennial heir, Laura Marling, Man from the Magazine rails against unimaginative interviewers and condescending guitar shop assistants, with Danielle taking ownership of “being a cunt”.Where WIMPIII’s songs don’t cleave as closely to any of the album’s declared narratives, there is still much of interest going on. The louche funk skit 3AM provides light relief by parodying late-night booty calls. Album opener Los Angeles has an unexpected Caribbean lilt, with Danielle questioning her love for her home town. Stranger still, Up from a Dream galumphs like glam rock, but some hyper-processed machine variant, strafed by low-flying effects.A handful of songs might have originated from any previous Haim era, but even these seem to bite and wallow harder than usual. The Steps – possibly the most conventional-sounding song here – may sound pretty, but Danielle is gnashing her teeth in frustration. “And every day I wake up and I make money for myself And though we share a bed, you know that I don’t need your help Do you understand? You don’t understand me, baby”. In the video, she clambers behind a drum kit in her pants and vest and lets rip."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7434b8026ecac753f4dd3019521889d955a58feb/0_75_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=389a341b5e7174121c80bcdffef4b826","title":"adeles classic glastonbury 2016 set follow it live","story":"With Glastonbury off this year, we relived Adele’s Pyramid stage triumph on BBC Two. And it was emotionalEarlier on Adele said: “I don’t really have many upbeat happy songs which I think is why a lot of people moaned about me coming tonight, but fuck you, they’re obviously not watching.” Yes, quite. There’s a kind of national sport – which could perhaps only be played in our country, where we manage to make cynicism so dreadfully boring – of people always moaning about the Glastonbury headliners. Noel Gallagher is probably to blame. You get it from keyboard warriors every year, sometimes with an uncomfortable racial undertone with the likes of Kanye and Stormzy, or a sexist one with Taylor Swift this year. They’re almost always proved wrong, and they certainly were with Adele.Emily Eavis has had to put up with this bullshit in person. “I think that one of the sides of the festival that is more challenging is the opinions that you get, and the negativity stuff,” she told me last week. “There was a dad who came up to me when I came to pick my kids up in our local school, and he was like, I don’t agree with what you’ve done, you shouldn’t have Stormzy, you should have the Stereophonics… he started really ranting, like he was banging a hammer over my head. Somerset is a really, really white area, and it doesn’t really reflect the rest of the world, this rural farming area where we live. So to put a festival on that introduces people to a whole new type of music, but pushes it on, that’s what I want to do.”I was so glad to hear that. The Pyramid has room for power balladeering just as much as anything, and I can’t wait til next year, and onward, to see what flavour of pop they let us taste next.Come back tomorrow when we follow along with David Bowie’s totally mindblowing, hits-packed 2000 set. Thanks for reading!She comes close to tears as she tells the crowd she’ll never forget this set, and goes into her last number, Someone Like You. What a strange song to sing to a crowd of this size. It’s a song from one person to another, and not even that: the subtext, perhaps, is that this is a letter that was written and never sent. It’s a consolation to herself, and a bit of wry self-deception: “I wish nothing but the best for you.” Yeah, right. And yet here we are – there’s lads shouting the words into her mic, and the whole crowd singing the top notes. It feels like a collective smoothing of everyone’s bumps in the road – the kind of mass emotional experience that only Glastonbury can bring.When We Were Young opens the encore. “It was just like a song” – one of the great meta-moments in pop, because this, of course, is one of the songs that things are just like. Or in other words: it’s a song that evokes the power of song itself so strongly, a song about how songs can throw life events into sharp relief.Does that make sense? I’ve spent some of the money I would have blown on Glastonbury pints this weekend on some extremely wanky craft beers to accompany this set and maybe they’ve kicked in. Technically for Adele I should be drinking rose wine, or shots of my own tears harvested from previous breakups, but wanky craft beers it is.Bit of footage here of a teenage Adele performing early on her career at Glastonbury at something -branded called the  Lounge! Need to bring this back next year and shamelessly curate a loads of music desk faves.I go to around eight or nine festivals each summer (not this year, sob) and each one has their own tribes. Wireless: teenagers who have spent all their Saturday job money on Bape. Reading: teenagers who have spent all their Saturday job money on Supreme. Green Man: dads who have spent all their children’s university fund on shorts from the Boden catalogue. But Glastonbury is a much broader cross-section and all the better for it – around me at this Adele gig were hipsters trying not to feel anything, wholesome families, lads with flares... Most memorable were a group of women right in front of me who were feeling every song so profoundly, but none as much as Set Fire to the Rain. There was a lot of reaching up, grabbing handfuls of air, and pulling them back towards their chests. They’d all clearly gone through some non-specific shit, and Adele was summing it all up in song.Maria from Brazil! I really remember this, she had planned a road trip around the world to this gig. Maria can’t remember any bands she’s seen all weekend, and to be honest, by Saturday night I barely can either – and I’m not having to remember them in front of 150,000 people. Then Adele has to fill in while an unwell person is carried out (“They’re probably moshing too hard to one of my songs”) and she tells a story about a woman in Vegas who pissed herself at one of her concerts and had to be carried out too. Extremely on-brand filler.Weird straw poll here of how much the UK hates or loves different parts of the UK, as people shout out where they’re from into her mic. Big boo for Stoke-on-Trent, but, y’know... Love for Holloway which is a 610 part of London at best. Mixed feelings for the underrated Coventry. General appreciation for Yorkshire and rightly so. “Oh my god you look like Brian Harvey from East 17!” Don’t get distracted, you gotta do your best song! And pound for pound, I’d say Rolling in the Deep is still her greatest work to date, knitting together her hell-hath-no-fury scorn and her bruised hurt into an irrepressible piece of retro pop perfection.I was in the field for this whole gig and this was just total euphoria and pandaemonium. “Fackinell, that was amazing!” It was!Like a seal wailing in the abyss .After an endearing screw-up on the first attempt, and a couple on the second attempt too, it’s River Lea, where I was living more or less next to when this song came out. Once went on a cycling date up there that ended with getting lost in a piece of frozen industrial wasteland near an Ikea. Pretty slick. Shout out to the Anchor and Hope pub on the river at Clapton, one of London’s very best pubs in my book.Adele has just done one of her relatively rare Instas, throwing back to this gig:Send My Love now, introduced as being about a person who “tried to come into my personal atmosphere, my personal space, trying to fuck everything up, and I was like: nah bruv. Naaaah.” This is the most Tottenham thing to have ever happened at Glastonbury, even more than the BBK takeover the following year.One of the best things about Adele is how un-mannered she is as a vocalist – such a clear, straightforward tone that hits you where it hurts. But that does make the few vocal tics she does have stand out all the more: the tongue clicks on “thick” and “opaque” on Hometown Glory, or the bluesy rasp she just gave those top notes on Don’t You Remember. I find these just a little bit forced and blandly theatrical, but it’s probably the only criticism I ever really have during her live sets, and a very pet-peeve one at that.Alison Krauss and Robert Plant’s sublime Raising Sand getting a shout out there, ahead of Don’t You Remember. Alison came in to the  a while back to answer readers’ questions – some of which made her cry, in a good way, and I had no tissues, it was awkward – and she had this to say:Raising Sand was an experiment, really, for Robert and myself. We went in there for three days and said: well, if it doesn’t work, see you next time! It was very lighthearted, and easygoing, with no expectations, and Robert is a lot of fun. He kept everybody laughing the whole time. My job was to be a singer for that project, just as Robert was - it was to support the duet. Band records are... you have a history of being together for a long time, I love how those records change as we change as we get older, have experiences, come back together and grow as a unit, just as people grow. They’re not as lighthearted recording sessions as Raising Sand was, hahaha!Something for my Raising Sand stans there anyway. Back to Adele!It’s just occurred to me that the verses of Skyfall and Everybody’s Gotta Learn Sometime share a lot of DNA."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3095f6032b55f9daaf9696f8475070ece49cf2e/0_279_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=838d67a5496864c99486329efc29c918","title":"after a decade of austerity what now","story":"Columnist John Harris has spent the past decade touring the country and reporting on what devastating budget cuts have meant to communities. Looking back, he sees some signs of hope amid the devastation. But will the government change its approach for the impending Covid-19 economic crash?When George Osborne delivered his spending review in June 2010 it ushered in what would become a decade of austerity measures. As budgets were slashed for children’s centres, libraries, parks and welfare, they were accompanied with the phrase “we are all in this together”.   columnist John Harris has been touring the country for the entire decade, chronicling the devastation that those cuts have made in local communities for his award-winning series Anywhere But Westminster.

Kate has spent a lifetime campaigning against child poverty and educational inequalities.“I look forward to working with her in this new role.”Green said: “It’s a privilege to have been asked to serve as shadow education secretary.“The coronavirus pandemic has had a devastating impact on children’s education. I look forward to working with teachers, unions, parents and councils to help ensure we get our children back in school as soon as possible.”Before her election in 2010, the 60-year-old was chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group. Before that, Green was director of the National Council for One Parent Families, now known as Gingerbread.The appointment came two days after Long-Bailey was sacked on Thursday for enthusiastically sharing an article published on the Independent website that contained a remark by English actor Maxine Peake, who claimed the Israeli secret service had taught US police the kneeling technique used by a Minneapolis officer against George Floyd, resulting in the latter’s death.The claim was denied by Israel, and Peake later retracted it.In a tweet containing a link to the article, Long-Bailey praised Peake as “an absolute diamond”.Leftwing Labour MPs including John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn were among MPs who met Starmer on Friday morning to express their concerns over the sacking, which has become a rallying point for critics of Starmer’s leadership.But calls from MPs on the left of the party for Long-Bailey to be reinstated were dismissed by Starmer, who said his mind was made up.For Green, it is a return to the shadow cabinet after serving as shadow minister for women and equalities under Corbyn’s leadership.She quit after the EU referendum in 2016, and went on to chair Owen Smith’s failed leadership bid later that year.Starmer gave her the role of shadow minister for child poverty strategy when he became leader in April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1ec29fdb5805f8a3855e23387b77f3cf599ee5a/0_89_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59f225f97897d8dd66e354b9a5c52579","title":"horse racing pyledriver a genuine derby hope for bits and bobs owner ","story":"An unexpected victory in the ‘Ascot Derby’ have shortened the odds on the colt for the real version at Epsom“It’s been a complete whirlwind,” says Guy Leach, one of those owners who have been supporting racing for decades without attaining any kind of fame. His involvement, while enjoyable, has generally been confined to Mondays at Chepstow and Tuesdays at Wolverhampton, where whirlwinds are rarely to be found, but now, thanks to the magnificent Pyledriver, Leach is a Royal Ascot winner with every reason to hope for a big result in Saturday’s Derby.Along with his brother, Huw, and Roger Devlin, a friend from long-ago university days, the Cardiff-based Leach has been owning “bits and bobs for about 20 years”. Flashy colts and Classic entries were never supposed to be on the agenda. They thought they had hit the big time when Pistol took them to the Cheltenham Festival in 2013, where he was a 25-1 shot in the Fred Winter.“He flattered to deceive a bit,” Leach recalls of Pistol, his voice a blend of affection and ruefulness. “He won two of his first three races but he loved lolling along against poor company and when he was up against the big boys, he didn’t really like it.”Something maybe a bit better than Pistol was what they were hoping for when they bought a hurdling prospect from Philip Hobbs in the summer of 2015. La Pyle had won on the Flat in France but could not translate that success to Worcester or Fontwell. Leach reckons an accident in training held her back.The friends decided to cut their losses and put her up for auction, changing their minds only when the late Kevin Mercer, of Usk Valley Stud, looked at her pedigree and liked what he saw. He encouraged Leach to try something new and breed from her.Her first foal is Pyledriver, a 50-1 winner of his debut race at Salisbury last summer who has continued to beat the odds. A big horse, he still looked a work in progress when sent to Royal Ascot recently, where he finished clear of a couple of fancied Aidan O’Brien runners in the King Edward VII Stakes, known as the Ascot Derby.Naturally enough, his owners have had a few offers along the way but are happy to sit tight for now. “There’s three of us, so even if it’s a sizeable number, it has to be ided three ways,” Leach says.One early approach was tempting but would probably have meant the colt disappearing overseas. Mindful that La Pyle would produce more foals, they wanted him running in Britain and hopefully advertising the quality of his family.“Our two daughters will be here, we’ll open the French doors, sit out on the terrace, have a glass of wine with them and we’ll be shouting away. We’ll still enjoy it.”It is a pity to be missing a once in a lifetime experience but Leach is philosophical. “A friend of mine said to me, why couldn’t you be at Ascot? But if you’re living on the 10th floor with two kids and a dog and you see people swanning around at Ascot … it’s not a fair world. So I accepted it, to be honest.”The bookmakers have Pyledriver sixth in the Derby betting at 16-1, a shorter price than he was for Ascot. “I’m realistic on the chance,” Leach says. “There’s obviously a lot of other good horses. But we’re just delighted to be there and he just keeps surpassing all expectations. You just hope he gets a clean run.”Saturday’s Northumberland Plate fell to Caravan Of Hope, trained by Hugo Palmer, who also had the third home, Collide. Now based in Newmarket and with no trace of a north-eastern accent, Palmer nonetheless claimed this as a local victory. “I’m a Newcastle United fan, I grew up just north of there, I went to university there,” he said. “The Plate is one of those races I’ve dreamt of winning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6c6f6b361126201967a2377272c88863774d9ee/0_331_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=89077197629b5ee0612fd581cef7c880","title":"what are glowing orbs of light in the sky world over","story":"Are they bad omens? A freak of nature? Huge, ghostly clusters of light – spotted from Australia to South America – have baffled scientists for decadesOne of the stranger children’s programmes from the 1980s was Willo the Wisp, featuring an evil TV set, a Cockney caterpillar, a lumpy dog-thing called the Moog and a benign, diaphanous narrator, Willo. Doubtless lost to its young viewers at the time – this journalist included – was the inspiration behind the programme’s title.Steeped in English folklore, will-o’-the-wisps have long been perceived as bad omens. These ghostly flickering lights emanating from marshland were said to lead nocturnal travellers into “dark waters” and even portend death. While the name will-o’-the-wisp is now widely used for any non-celestial spectral lights – regardless of topography – across the globe myths surrounding them are surprisingly consistent. To Australian Aborigines they are “corpse campfires” for Mexicans the spritely bruja is believed to be the soul of a witch. In South America they are simply luz mala: “evil light”.Urbanisation and light pollution may explain a lack of evidence for will-o’-the-wisps in countries like the UK, yet sightings persist across remoter parts of the world. North Carolina’s Brown Mountains remain a hotspot for lights that hover, move erratically and change colour. In a valley in central Norway, the Hessdalen Lights – multicoloured clusters of glowing orbs that dart across the landscape – have been witnessed for decades. In a recent episode of the Monster Talk podcast, researcher Jerry Drake and his wife describe a close-up encounter with a floating ball of light at a roadside in Iceland. Australia’s most celebrated will-o’-the-wisp has its own visitors’ centre, “Encounter Show” and song. Drawing on Aboriginal folklore, country star Slim Dusty’s 1968 Min Min Light is the ballad of a boy who follows a light “far into the night”, never to return. Located in Western Queensland, the lights are described as airborne fiery orbs with a tendency to follow rather than to lead. They can appear out of nowhere, split in two and allegedly interact “intelligently” with observers. The “Min Min Lights” are most often encountered on the 225-mile road between Winton and Boulia, where drivers often mistake them for approaching headlights until they pass and either vanish or bounce across the road.Scientists continue to offer explanations of swamp gas, fireflies, headlights, self-igniting plasma balls and even owls with a fondness for ingesting bioluminescent fungi. All attempts to shed light on such a multifarious and mercurial phenomenon remain, as yet, satisfyingly unsatisfying."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/943a0d60a987c05bc2a59f471ae2207a3d6fceba/0_143_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e688a29f987efc863ac2fee09becd75e","title":"celebrity masterchef rejoice tvs oldest format is back to save us","story":"Gregg Wallace and John Torode are joined by Apprentice also-rans and Casualty cast-offs for more food-based escapism I’m trying to think what there is new to say about Celebrity MasterChef (Wednesday, 9pm, BBC One), a TV format as ancient as the earth beneath us, a weeknightly appointment where Gregg Wallace – a man with one of the most multifaceted energies alive: at once capable of sparking you out in one punch, cheerfully selling you an organically farmed sausage, marrying your friend’s quiet adult daughter and somehow buying your car off you for scrap – prowls around a test kitchen, vacuum-sealed into a waistcoat, raising his eyebrows at turbot. John Torode is there, too. You’ve got the narrator, you’ve got the trips to outside restaurants, you’ve got a high-pressure lunch service where someone panics at 60 scallops. You know what it is by now.Although now it isn’t Celebrity MasterChef, not in the traditional sense. See, Celebrity MasterChef hasn’t changed but, and I don’t know if you’ve noticed this, the world has. Usually, big, bombastic, horn-section TV monoliths such as this start to falter around this stage in their run (we are 15 seasons in), the same beats that used to thrill now feeling tired think The Apprentice after that series where Sugar fired three people in one week then went mad and declared two winners. There’s nowhere you can go from there. You just have to relive the same nightmare, again and again, push the rock up the hill then have it tumble inevitably down, until quiet cancellation.But in a TV landscape battered by Covid-19, the sudden appearance of Good Old Fashioned Juggernaut TV – in among tired repeats, the soaps stuttering to a halt, the dreadful news reports – feels like an oasis in the desert. It doesn’t matter that I have, by now, seen one million former Casualty actors deglaze a pan. There is no combination of game meat and seasonal fruit that can surprise me, and yet here I am, watching John Barnes slop out a stir-fry, gleefully urging him to win. The stale pitta of this TV format has been sprinkled with water and revived in the oven. Celebrity MasterChef has, by way of coronavirus, been zhuzhed. The week one contestants happen to be very good, which makes dipping your toe back into the waters that bit easier: comedian Judi Love, my tip for the final Myles Stephenson, an X Factor survivor who seems to be one of the nicest people alive the aforementioned Barnes, who serves a stir-fry followed by a curry, seemingly in a bid to sustain his body through a tricky second year at uni. Representation on TV matters, and that’s why it was good to see my community – “people who make an absolute mess while cooking and who occasionally scream while doing it” – reflected in Death in Paradise’s Shyko Amos.And then there’s Apprentice reject Thomas Skinner, a man who is constantly accompanying his food with what can only be described as “a large pan of potatoes”. The screen cannot accommodate both him and Gregg in the same shot – their energies are too similar: both with an intrinsic need to make the last chirpy joke in a conversation, two East End alpha stags desperate to rut – but for as long as he lasts, he’ll be good value. Rejoice, rejoice. Celebrity MasterChef is back.

Is the mainstream ready for his radical comedy?There has only been one sketch that Eric Andre couldn’t get past the executives at Adult Swim. The suits didn’t bat an eyelid at Andre interviewing the reality TV star Lauren Conrad with a lipstick swastika on his forehead. No one pulled the plug when he beat up his naked personal assistant in front of Wiz Khalifa. It was all good when he turned up at the 2016 Republican convention and urinated on a banner while shouting “Black Lives Bladder”. Instead, the skit that was deemed too offensive to air was a simple country ditty … dedicated to the global Salafist terrorist network, al-Qaida.“We had a country singer come in,” explains Andre. “His angle was that al-Qaida has got a ‘bad rap’ in the country community, so we should sing a pro-al-Qaida song. He was like: “Oh, sweet, al-Qaaaaaaaaaida, can’t believe I never tried yaaaaaaaaaah.”Andre thinks the executives got cold feet because they were getting so much hate mail for another show: Black Jesus, in which the son of God is depicted as a guy from Compton. “Racist evangelical people were like: ‘Jesus is not black. How dare you desecrate his name?’ I was eating mushrooms in the woods in Canada with this girl I was dating, and I got a call from Adult Swim and they were like: ‘Hey, you gotta take that song out. The boss’s boss’s boss said that’s a no go.’”If that story was coming from someone else, you might dismiss it as apocryphal, but this is Eric Andre. Since starting his late-night show on Adult Swim, Cartoon Network’s after-hours alter ego, in 2012, he has placed a stack of ACME dynamite sticks beneath the conventions of late-night chatshows and unceremoniously blown them all up. The result is one of the most dysfunctional 15 minutes to appear on any channel, ever. Part stoner fever dream, part nightmarish send-up of Jimmy Kimmel and co, it has all the elements of late night: a host with a desk (Andre), a co-host without a desk (comedian and Broad City star Hannibal Buress), a house band (a bizarro jazz five-piece), special guests (everyone from the actual Dolph Lundgren to a George Clooney impersonator) – but minus any hint of logic.Its first season opened with Andre smashing up the show’s set in a state of undress before pulling his own teeth out, while Buress looked on, barely conscious. It set the tone: most episodes involve Andre destroying either the set or himself or both, and, unsurprisingly, that has led to a long list of injuries. He reveals that he was hospitalised with concussion after wrestler-turned-actor John Cena threw him through a bookcase in the show’s upcoming season. There was the time he got stitches in his hand after he punched through a car window, and during an interview with Vivica A Fox he crashed into his desk and wrenched his back. “We used to not have any stunt pads or a stunt coordinator,” he says of the show’s early days. “I was just, like, wiping out. It was brutal. I was destroying myself.”From a UK point of view, the show’s closest relatives are Vic and Bob’s anarchic mid-90s efforts and some of the Brass Eye sit-downs where Chris Morris would run absurdist circles round stunned guests. Like on Brass Eye, Andre’s early guests were often D-listers but, unlike Morris’s show, which originally wanted huge names, the lowly level of the talent was absolutely intentional. The key for Andre was getting someone who knew next to nothing about the show – ideally “reality people, athletes, people on procedural dramas”, because they are sitting ducks for pranks. As the show has progressed (its fifth season is in post-production) the names have got bigger – Jack Black and Chance the Rapper have both appeared. But Andre says now the status of the stars makes no difference.“We got it down to a science where we can kind of make it work with anybody. When tarantulas and scorpions are popping out of my desk, it doesn’t matter who they are, they’re going to have a strong reaction,” says Andre. “We don’t tell the guests a single thing before they come to set, and they waltz right into a house of horrors.” Occasionally, Andre meets his match. “Dennis Rodman told me he kissed a dead girl,” he says, still sounding genuinely perplexed. “He was very hard to prank or disturb. I just play a lunatic on TV he’s a 247 lunatic.”Born to an African-Haitian father and a Jewish mother, and raised in Florida’s “boring homogenised suburbs”, Andre made Jackass-style videos with his friends before he went to college in Boston to study the double bass. He soon gave up music for comedy – his influences  Tom Green’s pranks and Joan Rivers’s ribald one-liners to Chappelle’s Show. He began gigging in New York and LA with Buress, with whom he worked to create a pilot that was shot in the basement of a Brooklyn bodega and edited by Andre. He targeted Adult Swim, which was known for its alternative programming, but he was on unemployment benefit and desperately needed the work. “I remember looking at my computer screen and reading the email that said we had the first season and letting out this guttural, primal, caveman scream out of excitement,” says Andre. “My neighbour came out and she goes: ‘Are you OK?’ And I said: ‘Sorry, I just found out that I’m gonna have a career.’”On the phone, Andre is calm and considered, a world away from his frenetic chatshow host persona. He currently lives in Los Angeles, and for the last few days has been trying to figure out how to react to the death of George Floyd and police brutality in the US. He has been sharing posts about defunding the police and attending rallies, but Andre approaches politics in his work cautiously. “You don’t want to come off too preachy or heavy-handed,” he says. “You got to mix the highbrow and lowbrow to make it fun. There’s political satire in the mix, but it’s not like full-on. I’m not Bill Maher or Jon Stewart.”The show’s relationship to race at first glance seems more overt: there is a mixed-race host and black co-host on a late-night show. In 2012, that fact alone made it markedly different from the sea of all-white “Jimmys and Daves” who dominated the landscape. But Andre has largely left that aspect lingering in the background. “I thought it’d be more interesting if it’s these two dysfunctional black hosts who barely mentioned race.”That sideways take on race was developed when Andre moved to New York and started performing standup sets. “I felt like every black comedian or every comedian of colour had to talk about their race,” says Andre, who started gigging with Buress and found a kindred spirit in a comic who was black but didn’t do conventional race comedy. “What am I going to say about blackness that Richard Pryor, Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle haven’t covered?”Yet, underneath the seemingly aimless madness of Andre’s sketches there is something more radical afoot. In season one, skits included Andre sprinting through an all-white civil war re-enactment dressed as a runaway slave. In another he walks into a strip club dressed as Thomas Jefferson and demands a lapdance from a “big-bottomed, negro woman”. At a Tea Party event, he turns up to give attendees a goodie bag of Ku Klux Klan hoods, Confederate flags and White Power placards that they’d “forgotten”. In many of his man-on-the-street skits, the mere presence of a black man in an unlikely social situation is half the joke.That approach also bleeds into his standup special, which features an of-the-moment skit about the US reality show Cops and its inappropriate cod-reggae soundtrack. “You can’t slap reggae over police brutality footage and call it a day,” he tells the audience. Cops has since been cancelled as part of a wider reckoning over police violence. Andre puts his gag down to what he calls “pure good lucky timing”, but has also revealed that Netflix wanted him to remove the joke. He pushed back, saying it was the perfect time to point out the “absurdity of the police department and what a fucking hypocrisy and a disgrace it is”.Creative freedom and having the right to offend are notions that Andre holds dear. We talk on the same day that Netflix decides to remove The Mighty Boosh because of concerns that the Spirit of Jazz character (played by Noel Fielding in black makeup) was problematic. Andre isn’t impressed. “That is so missing the point,” he says. “It is about justice, equality, putting an end to police brutality. No one in the Black Lives Matter movement is like: ‘Yeah, you know The Mighty Boosh has been oppressing us all these years with that peripheral recurring character.’”For Andre, defending comics’ right to be offensive is an absolute. “I constantly defend black people, but I constantly defend comedy,” he says. “I’m constantly trying to push my shit to the edge. I’m an equal opportunity offender like Trey Parker and Matt Stone. We have to laugh at the absurdity and the pain of life. And when you water it down or make it awkwardly political when it isn’t, it’s missing the point.”Ultimately, Andre says, writing his show is very simple. He asks a group of comedians into the writers’ room and “we crack each other up. Comedy is like primal and instinctual. The process is: that made me laugh. Let’s shoot it. I’m not building a hydrogen bomb over here.”Eric Andre: Legalize Everything is on Netflix now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f161866caaff0d04969d53d924b73f8f213cd3c/0_0_3499_2100/master/3499.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=fac4228281b236f54ced0c80f6af28ca","title":"it looks like a gameshow russias pseudo vote on putins term limits","story":"Get-out-the-vote effort includes prize giveaways while campaign avoids focus on presidentThe people of Moscow received text messages this week telling them they had been registered to win “millions of prizes”.The catch? They have to vote on constitutional amendments that include allowing Vladimir Putin to remain in the Kremlin potentially until 2036.Organisers of Russia’s pseudo-referendum to amend the constitution – originally scheduled for 22 April but delayed owing to the coronavirus outbreak – appear to be making up the rules as they go along.In a single vote, Russians must choose whether to support a package of amendments that include pension and minimum wage boosts, a modest reorganisation of government, a constitutional mention of “faith in god”, a ban on gay marriage, exhortations to preserve Russian history, and a ban on top officials holding dual citizenship.Ads for the vote barely mention that it will also reset term limits for Putin, who has ruled since 2000. It is not an official referendum and the rules are custom-designed. Unlike in normal elections, voting is allowed online and takes place over a week, between 25 June and 1 July. As Russia continues to grapple with the coronavirus, some voting officials have decided it is safer to collect ballots outdoors, planting ballot boxes on tree stumps, in the boots of cars, in public buses and on plastic patio furniture.The referendum is both momentous and absurd. Russians can endorse (or oppose) a plan to let Putin run for two more terms, potentially prolonging his rule beyond that of Stalin, and then win a washing machine or a hairdryer.“It looks like a gameshow but I’m telling everybody I know to take this seriously, it’s enough to make you lose your mind,” said Oleg Kharlamov, a laboratory technician from Moscow who said he intended to vote against the amendments. The vote would help determine “who’s in charge for the next generation, and if we complain, they will say … ‘you voted for it’,” he said.Boris Yeltsin sacks his cabinet and appoints Putin, a political neophyte who headed the main successor to the KGB, as his acting prime minister and heir apparent.Yeltsin stuns Russia and the world by using his traditional new year message to announce his resignation and hand his sweeping powers, including the nuclear suitcase, to Putin.Putin is prevented by the constitution from running for a third term as president. The First deputy prime minister Dmitry Medvedev is elected in his stead. One of his earliest moves is to appoint Putin as prime minister, leaving little doubt that the two men plan, at the very least, to run Russia in tandem.Russia holds a yesno referendum on various topics including a proposal to amend the constitution to allow Putin to seek another two terms in the Kremlin.The raffles and prize giveaways are just part of a broad get-out-the-vote effort endorsed by the government. Companies have authorised their own prize giveaways that could allow them to track employee voting, while government workers such as teachers and doctors – some of whom are busy fighting the coronavirus outbreak – are reportedly being urged to cast ballots, in systematic attempts to boost turnout.Meanwhile, Instagram and TikTok influencers claim they have been offered millions of roubles by shady middlemen to urge their young followers to vote.Analysts say the Kremlin has concluded that the rescheduled referendum had to happen now, after Russia had declared victory over the coronavirus (despite more than 7,000 new cases a day still being reported) and before the effects of a battered economy or a potential second wave further sour public opinion.There are broad concerns that the results will be manipulated, particularly with limited scope to monitor polling places and online voting. Pavel Lobkov, a reporter for TV Rain, managed to vote in person at a polling station and then online on Thursday as the polls opened, effectively casting two ballots. Election officials said his extra vote would be discounted.There is almost no likelihood the vote will fail. Weeks before the vote, publishers had begun stocking Moscow bookstores with copies of the amended constitution.Rather than an emphatic public endorsement of Putin, the vote has more resembled a chore that must be done.“It will be something that the bureaucratic machine will be happy to get off its chest. ‘We’re done, now let’s forget about it,’” said Yekaterina Schulmann, a Moscow-based political scientist. She added that the vote was more of a burden on the Kremlin’s political resources than a chance to win a new political mandate. “It will not be the source of additional legitimacy to the political regime or to the president inidually.”The government campaign has avoided reminding Russians that they are potentially endorsing Putin’s right to rule until 2036, which Schulmann said was most isive amendment. Instead, billboards have urged Russians to “preserve family values” or featured images of the poet Alexander Pushkin saying “protect our language and culture”. Putin himself dangled the possibility of amending the constitution in 2012 but then boasted at his restraint in leaving the country’s founding document untouched. When he returned to the idea in the last year, advisors understood that the campaign would be isive. But despite calling for the referendum, Putin has exhibited a characteristic disdain for campaign politics, barely advocating for his own measures.The vote was targeted at stabilising elite circles, argued Stanovaya. “He needs a reference that he can show his elites and say: ‘I have public support to rule for as long as I believe I need to. No one of you has the right to discuss successors.”There remains debate over whether Putin will actually return for terms five and six or simply wants to avoid becoming a lame duck. As he himself argued during a TV interview last week, his potential return will put to bed discussions of a possible successor for the coming four years. Or 10. Or 16."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27c13c0a754d2d6d75b4e0fedfc0e3ecfcffb8a4/0_213_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27599246f0e593ec8d7c2573aab59259","title":"global report india covid 19 cases pass 500000 as us records highest daily increase","story":"US reports highest daily new infections as EU says it may exclude US from list of ‘safe countries’ Brazil records nearly 47,000 new casesIndia passed half a million coronavirus infections as experts advised the government to prioritise reducing mortality over containing the spread of Covid-19, while in the US surging infections prompted two of the biggest states to bring back coronavirus controls.Texas became the first state to revive lockdown measures, as new daily infections surged to nearly 6,000 and a senior official warned that hospitals risked being overwhelmed in the near future. “We opened too quickly,” Lina Hidalgo, judge for Harris county which includes Houston, said at a press conference on Friday.Florida, which has also seen record infection rates, banned alcohol sales in bars and at least one county in the state said it would close beaches over the Fourth of July weekend.Globally coronavirus cases are rising towards 10 million, with nearly half a million deaths. Brazil and the US have the largest outbreaks, between them accounting for more than a third of the global toll.The fourth biggest outbreak is in India, where health authorities reported 17,000 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, taking the country’s total infections past 500,000, according to Johns Hopkins university figures.In Delhi, hotels, wedding halls, an ashram and railway coaches are being repurposed for coronavirus care, as hospitals filled beyond capacity have been forced to turn patients away.So far India has recorded more than 15,000 deaths from Covid-19, a lower ratethan in many Western countries. Health experts are urging the government to prioritise keeping mortality down as the infection spreads.“Our focus should be on preventing deaths and not really getting bogged down because of the numbers. Numbers are going to increase,” said Dr Manoj Murhekar, a member of India’s main coronavirus task force and director of the National Institute of Epidemiology.As these countries battle their first wave, several countries that have largely suppressed the virus are trying to contain fresh regional outbreaks – from Beijing to Germany – and stop them escalating into second major wave of infections.Chancellor Angela Merkel warned on Saturday that the pandemic was far from over, and said everyone had “joint responsibility” for keeping the virus in check. The country has put a Western region of about 500,000 people back under lockdown after hundreds of workers at a meat processing plant tested positive.“Germany has gotten through the crisis well so far, but that doesn’t mean we are protected, that the risk has been averted,” she said. “That is not the case, as is demonstrated by these regional outbreaks.”China also reported an increase in new Covid-19 cases, the day after health authorities said they expected an outbreak in Beijing to be under control soon. There were 17 new cases in the capital, where several neighbourhoods have been locked down and a negative Covid test is required for travel to other parts of the country.As infections rise, Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche says it is unable to meet demand for molecular tests to identify active Covid-19 infections.‘The demand exceeds our production,’ chairman Christoph Franz told the Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger. The decision on where tests were shipped to depended, among other things, on infection rates and the availability of diagnostic equipment.On Friday Brazil recorded 46,860 new infections, its third consecutive day when that total was over 40,000. The new figures came amid warnings that the spread through smaller towns in Brazil’s interior risked a return of infections in major cities, dubbed a “boomerang effect,” as a lack of specialised medical treatment forced patients into larger urban centres.The Brazilian government has reached a deal with Oxford University and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to produce a promising coronavirus vaccine, one of several currently undergoing tests worldwide.It will start manufacturing more than 30m doses from December, allowing it to rapidly start inoculations next year if the vaccine is proved effective in total the $127m deal covers 100m vaccines, for a country of 210 million people.The US also reported its highest daily number of infections, with more than 40,000 cases. In the first coronavirus taskforce briefing since April – which was not held at the White House and had no presidential appearance – showed current infection rates outstripped the peak of April and May.European Union countries failed to settle on Friday on a final “safe list” of countries whose residents could travel to the bloc from July, with the United States, Brazil and Russia looked set to be excluded. Ambassadors from the 27 EU members convened from Friday afternoon to establish criteria for granting quarantine-free access from next Wednesday.A redrawn text of 10-20 countries was put to ambassadors, but many said they needed to consult first with their governments, diplomats said. The list did not include the United States, Brazil or Russia, one diplomat said. Discussions were continuing overnight, with the EU countries expected to give informal replies by Saturday evening, people familiar with the matter said.There is broad agreement that the bloc should only open up to those with a similar or better epidemiological situation, but there are questions about how to assess a country’s handling of the epidemic and the reliability of data.In other coronavirus developments:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22e8b124c4c0a2ca15314d9248bab2be500ecd6d/240_177_4553_2731/master/4553.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a374cedb3f8b75408c07ec0794818a8c","title":"lgbt marches from london to new york call for end to racism","story":"Minorities claim that they are seen ‘as second-class citizens’ within their own communitiesAs thousands of people marched in support of Pride and racial justice globally this weekend, many demonstrators called for an end to often-overlooked racism within the LGBT+ community.Pride events to celebrate LGBT+ rights are held globally throughout June – although most were cancelled or moved online this year because of the coronavirus pandemic – but the emergence of protests over racial injustice spurred a series of live events.Studies show that LGBT+ people of colour are more prone to violence and poverty. And a 2018 StonewallYouGov survey also found more than half of Black, Asian and other minority LGBT+ Britons had experienced discrimination from members of their own community.“It’s still definitely pretty prevalent,” said Kwamina Theo Amihyia, joining a Black Trans Lives Matter march in London.“As far as we’ve come, a lot of the strides made have been for white members of the (LGBT+) community and we’re still seen almost as second-class citizens.”Racial inequalities globally have come under the microscope following the death of George Floyd, 46, in police custody in the United States on 25 May.Many LGBT+ groups released statements in support of protests after Floyd’s death, pointing out the radical origins of the LGBT+ rights movement at the Stonewall Inn in New York 51 years ago that emerged to fight police brutality.“As a queer person myself, I face racism from the queer community – and it’s time we stamped it out,” Patrick King said as he marched along one of central London’s main thoroughfares with car horns blaring. London’s Black Trans Lives Matter march was one of several events planned this weekend to support Black Lives Matter.With the debate over systemic racism also hitting LGBT+ businesses this month, Gay dating apps Grindr and Scruff removed ethnicity filters in response to protests for racial justice.College student Donald Arrington, 19, who was due to take part in an informal Pride march in Los Angeles on Sunday, said he had been rejected on LGBT+ dating apps because he was black.“It’s always, ‘Hey sorry, you’re good looking, but unfortunately, I don’t dateblack guys’,” said Arrington,On Sunday, thousands of people are expected to attend New York’s Queer Liberation March, an event moved online due to the coronavirus but then back to the streets after the protests against police brutality and racism after Floyd’s death.“There needs to be the element of people in the streets and popular revolt and outrage,” said Natalie James, co-founder of the Reclaim Pride Coalition, which is hosting the march. “There’s not really a substitute for it.”But Ed Brockenbrough, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said the move by Pride organisations to adopt Black Lives Matter issues did not go far enough to address racism in the LGBT+ community.“Activism in black and brown queer communities has been happening for a long time without full buy-in from white gatekeepers of queer resources,” said Brockenbrough, whose research focuses on the challenges of LGBT+ people of colour.For Ted Brown, a veteran of Britain’s Gay Liberation Front (GLF) marching in London on Saturday, not enough has changed since he was out on the “scene” in the 1970s.“If you look around here, for example, I’m one of the few black people here … The LGBT+ community needs to look at themselves and find out how they can become more erse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49e4e48d0fb1c04041bf46d01924055daa17ff71/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a122596fd45f15826f236ec4e97df8e8","title":"lisa nandy leads calls for sanctions on israel over west bank annexations","story":"Labour leads calls for sanctions on Israel if it presses ahead with annexation plansThe UK must ban the import of goods from illegal settlements in the West Bank if the Israeli government presses ahead with annexation plans this week, Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, has said.The move would be a “major step” and require “courage that so far ministers have not been willing to show”, she told the Observer. But “such a blatant breach of international law must have consequences”.Boris Johnson told MPs earlier this month that the UK government “strongly objected” to the plan and restated support for the two-state solution. But the government is coming under increasing pressure to take concrete action if Netanyahu’s annexation proposals are implemented.Nandy said: “The proposal to unilaterally annex nearly a third of the West Bank is an illegal act which will undermine the prospect of a peaceful two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, and has serious implications for the stability of the Middle East.“It is a shameful proposition to which the UK cannot be a silent witness. Across the world concern is growing … So far the UK government has been conspicuously absent from this global response.“This is now urgent. The government must be clear with the Israeli coalition government that concrete action will follow, including a ban on goods entering Britain from the illegal settlements in the West Bank. This is a major step, but such a blatant breach of international law must have consequences. It will take a level of courage that so far ministers have not been willing to show.”Nandy’s proposal, backed by Keir Starmer, is a significant toughening of Labour’s policy on Israel. In the 2019 manifesto, the party merely called for a diplomatic solution.The Trump administration’s support for Netanyahu’s plan might discourage UK action for fear of jeopardising a UK-US trade deal, she added. But Britain had a “unique moral responsibility and must step up. Should we fail to do so, the world will pay the price for a long time to come.”Last week, more than 1,000 European parliamentarians signed a letter opposing annexation, saying “acquisition of territory by force … must have commensurate consequences” and calling on European leaders to “act decisively”.Among the 240 UK signatories were Michael Howard, a former Conservative party leader Chris Patten, former Conservative party chairman and governor of Hong Kong Pauline Neville-Jones, former chair of the British joint intelligence committee and George Robertson, former Nato secretary general.In a statement to be issuedon Monday, a coalition of UK-based humanitarian, development, human rights and faith organisations will demand the government outlines “clearly and publicly, what actual, meaningful consequences will result if Israel proceeds with its illegal annexation plans”.William Bell of Christian Aid, which is a member of the coalition, said the UK should formally recognise the state of Palestine and “end all trade with illegal settlements” in response to annexation.Sir Vincent Fean, a former British consul-general to Jerusalem, also called on the UK government to recognise the state of Palestine alongside Israel on pre-1967 borders.He said the consequences of annexation for Israel should include banning the importation of goods produced in illegal settlements and sanctions similar to those imposed on Russia after its illegal takeover of the Crimea in 2014."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21a415ac485892a8e297cf3499ad706e195a355d/0_99_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a280c6c4682e86e8a97332b8d2617841","title":"pakistan international airlines national airline reassures pilot licences","story":"Action prompted by preliminary report on crash of PIA aircraft last monthPakistan’s national airline has written to foreign missions and regulatory bodies, assuring them it has grounded 141 pilots suspected of obtaining licenses through unfair means, the carrier’s spokesman has said.The move is an attempt to assuage safety concerns after Pakistan’s aviation minister, Ghulam Sarwar Khan, said on Friday the government had asked various commercial airlines, flying clubs and charter companies to ground 262 pilots until investigations into their qualifications are completed.The action was prompted by a preliminary report on the crash of a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) aircraft in Karachi last month, which found pilots had failed to follow standard procedures.Global safety and transport bodies expressed concern about the “dubious” licenses and said they were looking into the matter.

So why is it so hard for her to find people to identify with in the media?I’m a Gen Z Muslim woman with immigrant parents and I don’t fit many stereotypes. Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse. We all need role models and there are lots of us who are being let down.It’s up to all of us to fix that. Starting now. Here, five people reveal how they’re breaking boundaries in race, mental health, body image, religion and age representation ...Malin Andersson“Mental health representation will make us all stronger,” says Malin Andersson, a mental health advocate and TV personality.I talk about grief, depression, body positivity, and domestic violence on my Instagram to open up those conversations. I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community. This can lead to them being attacked by their own community if they do or say something wrong. I want to see different types of beauty in the media.Stephanie Yeboah“If I’d seen someone who looked like me, I would’ve had less self-hate issues,” says body positivity blogger Stephanie Yeboah.“I grew up feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly. After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance.

Illustration by Michael Viney “I was trying to remember today how the colours are banded on the puffin’s curious triangular bill: was it red-yellow-blue or blue-yellow-red? So I descended the northern cliff for a closer look at them.“I was not put off by its precipitous plunge and the boiling of the sea below, but made my way down cautiously, kicking my boots well in at every step. At about a hundred feet down I found myself at the flight-level of the puffins.“These gay little auks fly in wide ellipses between cliff and sea, seeming without purpose and indefinitely, but it is not easy to follow an inidual puffin for their whole circuit of a teeming merry-go-round.“They were flying so close to me today, within a yard or so, that I could see them glance at me as they passed. Their flight is quicker than one thinks for all its apparent whirring clumsiness, so that trying to note the permutation of their bill colours was like trying to read the title on a revolving gramophone record...”That was me, a mere half-century ago, a solitary young eccentric camped on a Blasket island and pursuing this trivial and risky impulse. Why not stay on the clifftop, lying among the sea-pinks, to watch them perch outside their burrows in the evening sun? I must have forgotten my binoculars. Puffins, one of many of the world’s declining seabirds, are receiving much more necessary and serious attention. Like others – petrels and shearwaters, for example – who visit land only to breed, nesting in burrows and crevices and using darkness to dodge their predators, they invite challenging questions. How many are there, where do they go in winter, and what threatens their populations?The latest report on our breeding seabirds, from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, speaks of the “cryptic breeding ecology” of this 20 per cent of burrow-nesters and waits on the results of ongoing surveys.In the last big census attempt, Seabird 2000, many Irish islands proved too hard to land on or were beyond the capacity to organise. Puffins, in particular, were nesting on dangerously steep slopes and inaccessible clifftops. Playing tapes of recorded calls brought responses from most of the “apparently occupied burrows”, numbering more than 16,000.Since then, more intensive and hi-tech surveys by researchers at University College Cork suggest that some population figures for burrow-nesters have been gross underestimates. UCC’s Gavin Arneill and a fieldwork team found almost 4,000 pairs of storm petrels nesting on High Island, off Connemara, compared with the Seabird estimate of 22.UCC’s Dr Mark Jessop, an Australian zoologist, has worked with colleagues to track the winter travels of Irish puffins, their bright summer colours dulled or discarded. Tagging dispersing birds with GPS locators, he found puffins from Skellig Michael flying the Atlantic as far as Canada and Greenland to feed on shoals of oil-rich capelin.In 2017 came an international study, led by Oxford University and involving UCC, that had tracked 270 birds from 13 puffin colonies in North America, Norway, Iceland, Greenland and Ireland. While US puffins migrated several hundred kilometres at most, birds from Ireland travelled up to 4,700km on return flights across the Atlantic.This, Jessop says, could leave the puffins too tired to breed when they arrive, barely able to lay one egg and forage food for a single chick. This could help to explain falling numbers at many Irish colonies.Floating on the tidesAnother recent study, by UCC researchers and the Zoological Society of London, found that puffins from colonies at the Saltee islands, Co Wexford, use strong tidal currents to float, rather than fly, between areas where they could e most successfully for sand eels. This saves them substantial energy.On the Great Saltee Island – a special area of conservation for birds – predation by rats has reduced breeding puffins from 2,000 to 50 birds. On the more remote and rat-free puffin cliffs, the main predators of eggs and chicks are the great black-backed gulls, breeding elsewhere on the island.Storm petrels and shearwaters return from fishing to feed their chicks under cover of darkness. But puffins bring beakfuls of sand-eels to the burrow by day and roost offshore at night. The single chick, however, takes its crucial first journey to the sea under darkness, having been left alone to get hungry.A witness to this was the Welsh ornithologist Ronald Lockley. In his classic Letters from Stockholm (1947), he told of measuring the period of the parents’ desertion by pushing matchsticks upright in the mouths of marked burrows.At length, in late July or August, several days after the last flattening of the matchsticks, the chicks emerged at night “to blunder onwards and downwards until they could at last flutter over the cliffs to the sea”."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"One Change: We may be at the beginning of a new era with changes starting to happenFriends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation PlanFrench president created convention in April 2019 in response to gilets jaunes revolt"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climate"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290672.1593285953!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"young eagles land in kerry from norway to bolster irish breeding population","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA small group of young white-tailed eagles arrived into Kerry airport on Saturday from Norway as part of a project to bolster the breeding population of this once extinct species in Ireland. Photograph: iStockGetty.A small group of young white-tailed eagles arrived into Kerry airport on Saturday from Norway as part of a project to bolster the breeding population of this once extinct species in Ireland.The young eagles, which were monitored for a number of months in Norway before coming to Ireland, will be released at Lough Derg, the lower Shannon estuary and Killarney National Park.They arrived in Ireland on Saturday afternoon after a flight of four hours and 20 minutes from Trondheim airport in northern Norway. Their arrival marks the second phase of a the project to re-establish the presence of these eagles in Ireland.The birds, which were collected in June 2020 by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, will be held at sites in Munster before released into the wild in early to mid-August. They will be tagged before release to allow the project to monitor their progress and their integration into the exiting Irish breeding population, according to a statement from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.The department noted that the reintroduction project was “critical” in terms of Ireland’s bioersity and said reintroducing a wild species that was exterminated by man would “contribute significantly to the economic, tourism and local communities and indeed to human wellbeing”.A total of ten young eagles collected in Norway are expected to be released across the three Irish sites this year to provide an additional boost to the small Irish breeding population.One hundred white-tailed eagles were released in Killarney National Park in Co Kerry between 2007 and 2011 and subsequently spread out across Ireland with the first breeding taking place in 2012 on Lough Derg in Co Clare. Since then, between eight to ten pairs have successfully fledged 26 chicks with an additional six chicks expected to be born into the wild in Munster over the coming weeks.Eagle nestA live streaming camera of a white-tailed eagle nest has been set up at a nest in Glengariff in Co Cork by the National Parks and Wildlife Service so members of the public can follow the arrival of new chicks this summer.The department warned that while some Irish-bred eagles were reaching maturity and starting to breed, the small population on this island remains vulnerable to illegal poisoning. A decision was made to carry out a supplementary release of birds to bolster numbers following the negative effects of the 2018 avian flu and Storm Hannah last year, said the department.The project will continue to work with farming communities in the release areas to ensure that eagles and farming can coexist, it added.Minister of Culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht Josepha Madigan welcomed the new arrivals and praised wildlife personnel involved in the project in Ireland and Norway for their “incredible team effort”.“Thanks to their logistical work, bringing the latest influx of White-tailed Eagles to these shores, the future is positive for the eagle, which had been extinct in Ireland for over a century,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill The State – largely – reopens on Monday, leaving people over 70 and the medically vulnerable with choices to make. Urging caution, the chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan, nevertheless, accepts that normal life “has to resume”.What is this group generally being advised to do from Monday?Use one’s judgment. Maintain physical distancing from visitors and when visiting. Use face coverings during indoor visits and while out shopping or in busy public places.Should the over-70s and medically vulnerable travel anywhere in Ireland?There is nothing stopping them. Prof Mary Horgan, infectious diseases physician and president of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, said travelling to remote or rural areas with low infection rates is a “safe thing to do”.“It is following simple rules: the three Cs – avoiding crowds, avoiding too many contacts and avoiding closed environments that are not well ventilated,” she said.Should such people travel sooner rather than later?Probably. Virus levels are now very low, so now might be the time to visit much-missed loved ones.Should people over 70 stay overnight with a loved one or permit sleepovers for grandchildren?The usual distancing advice applies, but the vulnerable should be more careful.Dr Eoin Feeney, an infectious diseases specialist at St Vincent’s hospital in Dublin, says relatives can stay with loved ones if they stay apart while in the house, keep washing hands and if everyone is well.“If you are indoors and close to people, we are recommending that face coverings are worn. If someone is upstairs and someone else is downstairs, I don’t see a problem with that,” he said. What about hugging? Can people in vulnerable groups hug others?Again, it is down to best judgment and personal choices, health experts say. Doctors say not every person over 70 is at the same risk. Older people with other illnesses are at greater riskWith good hand hygiene and wearing face coverings inside, Dr Feeney says “limited hugs” are “reasonable” because community transmission is currently low. Risks must be assessed but “everyone” needs the lift of a relative’s visit.Dr Mary Favier said different people face different risks. One of her 75-year-old patients wants to go back out on their motorcycle. Another is more frail, has not left the house for months and needs to start with exercising at home.“It is all about the balance of the risks,” she said, adding that GPs offer older patients the opportunity and space to explore the subject. “Often they are over-protected by over-zealous relatives,” she said.Age Action, the advocacy group for older people, said older people must exercise their own judgment “on how to live their lives”, but they need accurate information. There is “a level of frustration” at the vagueness of the guidelines, said Age Action’s Celine Clarke, especially about the ones due to come into force when Phase 4 kicks in on July 20th."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Senator is appointed to Cabinet for the first time since the early 1980s18-year-old arrested in connection with Jason Lee Martin\u0026rsquos death remains in custodyStephen Donnelly will be Minister for Health as Roderic O\u0026rsquoGorman becomes Minister for ChildcareTraveller rights activist Eileen Flynn one of Taoiseach 11 appointmentsRaid carried out on Friday at premises in Cabinteely and ClondalkinWebcam set up in Glengariff, Co Cork so public can follow hatching of chicks onlineRichard Bruton, Eoghan Murphy, Charlie Flanagan, Joe McHugh among those left outWarren Crossan was shot dead off Falls Road on Saturday afternoonNumber of new cases among young people \u0026lsquoa worrying trend\u0026rsquo, says Tony HolohanUnsettled conditions set to continue through next weekSinn F\u0026eacutein leader Mary Lou McDonald says her party will continue to push for \u0026lsquochange\u0026rsquoPandemic resulting in groups congregating and engaging in anti-social activity, says Policing AuthorityPolice say 14-year-old was found in extensive storm drain, no suggestion of foul play\u0026lsquoThere wasn\u0026rsquot a deal struck because the government is made up of three parties\u0026rsquoMiche\u0026aacutel Martin says wife Mary has been his \u0026lsquopillar of support and partner since college days\u0026rsquoSeven per cent of cases notified over past fortnight associated with travelRoss says people taking driving tests will face new measures to address coronavirus issueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290680.1593288382!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nine of the 11 taoiseach s appointees to the seanad are women","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTraveller rights activist Eileen Flynn is one of Taoiseach Micheál Martin’s 11 appointments to the Seanad.  Photograph: Nick BradshawTraveller rights activist Eileen Flynn is one of Taoiseach Micheál Martin’s 11 appointments to the Seanad.Ms Flynn, from Ballyfermot in Dublin, ran in the Seanad elections earlier this year but did not take a seat. She grew up in in the Labre Park Traveller housing site and has lived in Donegal since 2018, having married a local “settled” man, Liam White. They have a daughter.The Programme for Government said that at least half of the Taoiseach’s 11 should be women and split the appointments on the ratio of four each for Fianna Fáil and two for the Greens, with one independent.The Fianna Fáil nominations to the Seanad are former Clare TD Timmy Dooley, who lost his seat at the last general election, Lorraine Clifford Lee, who was a member of the last Seanad and was an unsuccessful general election candidate in Dublin Fingal, Dublin city councillor Mary Fitzpatrick, who ran for the party in Dublin Central but who did not take a seat, and Louth councillor Erin McGreehan.Fianna Fáil currently has no Dáil seat in Louth and will be hoping that Ms McGreehan can use the Seanad as a platform to become a TD.For Fine Gael, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has chosen Emer Currie, who was his running mate at the last general election in Dublin West but did not win a Dáil seat, former minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty, who lost her seat in Meath East, Roscommon councillor Aisling Dolan, who ran in the general election in Roscommon-Galway and South Dublin councillor Mary Seery-Kearney.For the Green Party, Kildare councillor Vincent P Martin has also been appointed. Mr Martin, a senior counsel, is a brother of Green Party deputy leader Catherine Martin.He ran in Kildare North at the last general election and will hope to win a seat in the constituency for the Green Party in future. The other Green Party nominees is Clare councillor Róisín Garvey, who also ran for the Greens in Clare at the last election. She is seen as loyal to party leader Eamon Ryan.Mr Martin’s appointments means that the Seanad is now fully constituted and can pass required legislation. The previous government had maintained a new taoiseach must appoint 11 senators to fully constitute the Seanad and renew the Offences Against the State Act and the Criminal Justice amendment acts, decisions which renew the mandate of the non-jury Special Criminal Court for another 12 months.The Seanad also needs to pass legislation proposed by the last government to assist businesses through the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis.The Upper House will now sit on Monday to elect a cathaoirleach on Monday and to deal with the required, outstanding legislation.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290693.1593296152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who is in the new cabinet members in profile","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin is now Minister   for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.A new Taoiseach was elected on Saturday and a range of new Ministers were appointed. Here’s all you need to know about them:He became party leader in 2011 just weeks before the general election when Fianna Fail lost 51 seats in the fall-out from the economic collapse. The five wilderness years were spent re-organising the party and its decimated cohort of TDs.In 2016 Fianna Fáil had a mini-revival, regaining 23 seats and in the 2019 local elections won the most seats of any party. The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fail’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fail negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague former senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fail spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fail out of government. The intense five-weeks campaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011.As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs.Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working Minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB accommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fail’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electoral industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of state for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Leo Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio taoiseach Enda Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fail.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Eamon Ryan and deputy leader Catherine Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fail, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290571.1593264861!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach pledges recovery and renewal at centre of new government s priorities","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil Leader Micheál Martin as he emerged from the Convention Centre after being elected  Taoiseach. Photograph: Alan Betson New Taoiseach Micheál Martin has pledged that “recovery and renewal” are at the centre of the new Government’s priorities.Addressing the Dáil, assembled in the Convention Centre in Dublin rather than Leinster House due to social distancing requirements, Mr Martin said the coronavirus pandemic “is the fastest moving recession ever to hit our country and to overcome it we must act with urgency and ambition”.The new Taoiseach, speaking ahead of his trip to Áras an Uachtaráin to receive his seal of office, said there are “nearly 900,000 of our people wholly or partly relying on special pandemic payments”.There was no question about the Government’s most urgent work, which was to “move forward rapidly to secure a recovery to benefit all of our people”.He acknowledged the work of the outgoing government and “especially Minister for Health Deputy Simon Harris and outgoing Taoiseach Deputy Leo Varadkar”.“But there is much more that we can and must do to help our society and our economy to recover.”He said that, starting today, helping society and economy to recover “will be at the very centre of everything the new Government will do”.The new Taoiseach said the three coalition parties - Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens - come from very different traditions. “We do not and could not be expected to agree on everything. However, we have been able to agree on core democratic principles and on a balanced and comprehensive programme.“We are conscious of the fact that must work hard to build trust with each other and with the people we have a duty and privilege to serve.”He added: “At the same time, we know that there are other great challenges which we faced before the pandemic and which remain to be overcome.“Too many of our people cannot find a decent and affordable place to live. Waiting times for urgent treatments are far too long.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"maxine peake vs laurence fox reveals double standards chattering","story":"The trouble with double-standards in the age of mass communication is that everybody can see them. Where once an inidual, institution or movement might have hoped to conceal their hypocrisies, now they are there for everyone to witness. So it is with the case of Maxine Peake. This week, the actress made headlines because of an interview in which she alleged that the Israelis taught the US police how to kill George Floyd. The problem is that it is a lie. Even the far-Left, anti-Israel group Amnesty – widely alleged to be the source of the story – has denied that it is true. It is simple anti-Zionism reheated to suit the current moment.So perhaps it isn’t surprising that a Jeremy Corbyn protégée like Rebecca Long-Bailey should have retweeted the interview in which Peake made this claim. Apart from its racism, the interview included the standard actress stuff about the wonders of Corbynism and the importance of bringing down capitalism. They aren’t fools, these actresses. They know that if there’s one way that their profession will be reinvigorated, post-lockdown, it will be through the obliteration of the market economy. But Labour is now in new hands. And Keir Starmer swiftly sacked Long-Bailey. While his predecessor said there was no place for racism at the top of Labour, Starmer has done something to prove it.But the question I want answered is: where is Equity, the actors’ union? Earlier this year, after the actor Laurence Fox appeared on Question Time, the union (of which he is not even a member) denounced him. Fox’s crime was to say that he didn’t think Britain was a racist country. For this, Equity branded him a “disgrace”. Actor after actor lined up to condemn him and lobby to make sure he never worked again. After Fox took legal action and forced an apology out of Equity, the entire “race equality committee” of the union resigned.Perhaps this is why Equity have been so silent on Peake. Because there is no one left to do the full witch-dunking denunciation act. Or perhaps the silence is explained in another way. The same way that one might explain the silence of the actors and celebs who clambered over each other to denounce Fox. Could it be that most people in the acting and celebrity worlds are happy with someone who promotes conspiracy theories, so long as it is wrapped up in the fashionable idiot language of anti-capitalism and “equality”?I suspect so. In which case I would strongly recommend that Peake and her colleagues mull on something. What Fox said on Question Time reflects the sentiment of the vast majority of the British public. What Peake said reflects the views of a small group of malcontents who the public has rejected at the ballot box every time we have had the chance. So here is the thing, my actor-y friends. It’s not the public who are living in some hyper-partisan, out-of-touch bubble. It’s you.

Those crowds who descended on Bournemouth in such anti-social numbers that they created a civic emergency, and the organisers of illegal raves in south London who got into a serious ruckus with the police are the public enemies of the day. The hordes who trashed the Dorset beaches and the frantic dancers in the streets of Lambeth were certainly asking for it.They must have expected the righteous condemnation that has engulfed them. So if their behaviour was so unreasonable and clearly culpable, why did they do it? That is the important question to ask, rather than the one that Government officials and their supremely obtuse advisers persist in asking: how can we stop them? The only possible answer to that can be, by introducing more punitive forms of repression which nobody seems to think is a practical solution.So let me suggest an analysis that might offer an answer to the other question. These people are behaving irrationally because they have been driven technically crazy. What do you expect will happen when you imprison innocent people, with no imminent prospect of release or even a promised end date to the sentence? (Do you know why prison officers are so opposed to indefinite sentences without possibility of parole? Because prisoners who have nothing to lose become uncontrollable and violently destructive.)What is likely to be the result when millions of blameless iniduals are locked into unnatural social isolation with most of their normal activities and occupations – the things that make life recognisably human – banned? Answer: they will spring the lock on their cages. Having done that, they are more likely to abandon their sense of propriety and normal standards of decent behaviour.This is lockdown hysteria – a previously unrecorded form of group madness. It should not have been beyond the reach of anybody with a commonsense understanding of the human condition to anticipate that the restrictions being imposed on ordinary life would become intolerable – especially in a law-abiding society like this one where the population takes to heart its duty to obey even the most officious rules.But common sense – and an understanding of human relationships – scarcely seems to have featured in Government policy. The things that were ruled out (for the foreseeable future) were not just cruel and thoughtless: they appeared to involve professional ignorance of a quite shocking kind. I have heard it said (by scientists with very narrow expertise) that the psychological and social damage that is being done to children is exaggerated: the young are resilient, they say, and will recover quickly. This is stupidly, dangerously wrong.Children have crucial developmental stages in which their social attitudes are formed: if they do not encounter these critical steps at the appropriate time, their ability to form relationships can be permanently affected. While such insight may be beyond the remit of epidemiologists, one might have expected the education unions for whom childhood development is the main business of their vocation, to be aware of it. But the union officials (most of whom are not practising teachers) who led the resistance to schools re-opening were playing a much bigger game: this was trade union power politics as we have not seen it since the 1970s.How vividly I recall the political activism that shut the schools of the London borough where I lived back in the golden age of union activism. During the legendary Winter of Discontent in 1979, Haringey Council shut all its schools in solidarity with the striking caretakers. (This may not have been unconnected to the fact that the then chairman of the council’s education committee was one Jeremy Corbyn.) The teachers at my daughter’s primary school were instructed by their union convenors to offer no instruction (even to groups of pupils in the homes of parents) because this would constitute strike breaking.It was a fight to the death – and by the end of the 1980s, such “sympathy strikes” had been made illegal. But this time round the Government has provided the unions’ game with its most valuable card: by insisting on maintaining the social distancing rule – even in its reduced form – the teaching unions, and the local councils who support their policy of resistance can argue that it is physically impossible to permit the resumption of normal classroom attendance.How much more clearly can I put this? If the distancing regulation were dropped, the refusal of the unions to cooperate in a reopening of the schools would be nothing more than a strike – and calling a strike without a ballot of the full union membership is illegal. If the Government wants to prevail in this reignited battle for control of the schools, then it will have to stop obeying the lockdown lobby whose advice is increasingly contentious.Why are they so adamant that, however clear it is that the virus now no longer stalks our streets, there is certainly going to be a second wave in autumn or winter? Because when the weather cools, they say, the favourable conditions for its revival will return. Just look at those food plants in Germany and Wales where outbreaks have occurred in refrigerated environments. Ergo when the summer warmth goes, the epidemic will return.But wait a minute. If hot weather slows the spread, why are the states of Arizona and Texas – which are far hotter than Britain – currently suffering exponential increases in cases? Might there be other reasons than cold air for outbreaks in places where fresh meat is processed and chickens are slaughtered? And even if there is to be a second wave – isn’t that more reason to allow the country to take a few free breaths now so that it will be better able to cope psychologically and economically with another pause? Otherwise, what is the risk that we will, by then, be too deranged to care? It is human sensitivity – not statistical modelling – that is needed to give answers to these questions.

He became the dean of Libya\u0027s Higher Studies and Academic Research Academy, based in Tripoli. The academy\u0027s key function, according to one former senior British diplomat, was to groom Gaddafi protégés.By 1999, Britain\u0027s relations with Libya – frozen after WPc Fletcher\u0027s murder – were beginning to thaw. That year, two Libyan intelligence agents, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, were extradited from Libya to the Netherlands to face trial for the Lockerbie bombing.As part of that deal to improve Anglo-Libyan relations, in 2000 Mabrouk, now 62, was allowed to come back to Britain. It seems his arrival into the UK did not always go smoothly and he would be quizzed at the airport about his involvement in WPc Fletcher\u0027s murder. In July 2009, he felt so secure in the UK that he bought a house without any mortgage for £385,000. It is now worth almost double that amount.Following the overthrow of Gaddafi in 2011, Mabrouk fled to his bolthole in Berkshire, claiming asylum in the UK. A year later, the BBC reported that he was wanted by Libya\u0027s transitional government and was number 107 on its list of iniduals suspected of misusing state funds.Two years later, any chance of a prosecution of Mabrouk was blocked on the grounds of national security. His lawyers said there had never been a shred of evidence against him.

Effectively we used to live in a state largely similar to lockdown 100 years ago, which created the conditions for the Spanish flu to come and kill 50 million people.”She explained how “the fate” of any virus and our reaction to it depends on previous exposure to other strains of that pathogen. She claimed lessons can be learned also from European New World explorers who triggered a “virgin soil epidemic” when they landed among people who had had no previous contact with viruses both common and relatively harmless in the West.“The kind of immunity that protects you against very severe symptoms and death can be acquired by exposure to related pathogens rather than the virus itself,” she said, explaining how there have been numerous strains of coronavirus.“We do know populations were decimated in the New World with the introduction of pathogens. It can lead to very severe consequences at a population level having very little immunity from a lack of exposure.”Prof Gupta is convinced international travel helps build up defences against emerging viruses, so the positives of easing restrictions outweigh the negatives. Britons have been on the move again recently, as the graphic below shows: She said: “The conditions for the spread of a virus have been enhanced by current practices of global mixing with worldwide travel. But, what also has been strengthened is the level of cross-protection we gain from exposure to different bugs.“Overall, we are in a better place with all this international travel. So, the conditions where a pathogen might kill a lot of people has been reduced.” She said she expects a resurgence of Covid-19 in the winter months, but eventually the virus will end up like flu, a pathogen the public learns to live with and which claims a number of lives of vulnerable people each year.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no masks needed amsterdams red light district prepares reopen","story":"It was a surprise to everyone – especially sex workers – when Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte announced that from July 1 they could return to work.Of all of the “contact” professions, this was dogged with most concern in the Netherlands, which is now reopening after seeing daily corona deaths fall to single figures. The country has had the biggest percentage drop in weekly cases of 45 countries, according to one analysis, and this week announced a major relaxation of its “intelligent” lockdown.Sex workers, often unable to access government support because of how they are registered, have been keen to restart work. Unions had even sent the government their own protocol of measures from “don’t shake hands” to banning positions in the client’s “moist breath zone”.In the red light district in Amsterdam this weekend, window brothels are being spruced up ready for work. The Red Light United union expects sex workers to wear gloves and avoid oral sex, and André van Dorst, director of the VER union for relaxation businesses, told The Sunday  safety would come first: “There are already public health institute hygiene protocols, which were no problem to introduce in the industry and are in general complied with. The same thing will happen with corona because nobody trusts this virus – everyone is in safety mode.”The Netherlands was one of the earlier countries in Europe to show mass infections, and on March 16 started what Rutte called an intelligent lockdown: schools, bars, restaurants, gyms and contact professions were shut and people asked to keep a distance and work from home. Later, the government imposed a limit of three adults meeting and €390 personal fines, but actually gave out very few personal or business fines.Rutte has always appealed to people’s common sense rather than taking a top-down approach. “From the beginning, we have tried to talk adult to adult to tell Dutch society of the facts and what the world’s best virologists are advising,” he said this week.However, faced with an economic contraction of 6 per cent, the Dutch experts now recommend broad-scale reopening, with limits especially inside and 1.5m distancing (or facemasks). Loes Hartman, a spokeswoman for the RIVM, said they had now also weighed up the \u0027social costs\u0027 of lockdown: “This means the extent to which children will be behind if schools are closed, economic damage, psychological impacts and a broad spectrum of effects that are often negative.”Not everything has gone right. There has been some criticism that many corona deaths went uncounted due to limited testing before June, and officially the country of 17 million has the 15th highest number of deaths internationally. Economist Mathijs Bouman told The : “Economically, we have managed it quite well but of course we have a rather high death rate, especially in nursing homes, and a lot of that was probably preventable. Our laid-back approach, especially in testing, was clearly not the right one so we lost the game in the first couple of weeks.“We are going to the boundaries of what’s possible at the moment – but since one third of our money is earned abroad we are still a cork floating on a wild international sea.”The sex trade could be at the coalface of whether the bold Dutch approach will provoke a second wave of infection – for those that did, indeed, stop.Sex work activist and webcam and pornography performer Yvette Luhrs told NOS Radio 1 that the reopening was a relief, tinged with bitterness. “It took too long for a colleague who ended it all earlier this week,” she said, “but also for people who have been evicted from their homes, and for the sex workers who just had to carry on working and were at risk.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"private schools offer state pupils summer catch up sessions","story":"Private schools have offered to run summer catch up courses for local children, as they accuse ministers of “ignoring” their offers to assist.Christopher King, chief executive of the Independent Association of Prep Schools, has written to the Education Secretary to express his “frustration” at the Government’s “reluctance to accept help” from fee-paying institutions.In the letter, seen by The Sunday , he said that members of his association were prepared to open up their buildings in July and August to run summer courses for children in their local community.Mr King said that private schools could make a “significant difference” to the education of children in their local community by helping them get up to speed over the summer holidays, and would come at a minimal or no cost to parents.The offer from independent schools comes amid rising concern about the plight of children during lockdown and fears that a decade of progress in narrowing the attainment gap is in danger of being reversed.Research published earlier this week showed that more than two million children have done virtually no schoolwork during lockdown.One in five pupils in the UK – equating to around 2.3 million children – either did no home learning at all or less than one hour a day, according to a report by University College London.The study found that there was a huge gulf between the amount of home learning carried out by pupils at state and private schools.Nearly a third (31 per cent) of private schools provided four or more online lessons each day, compared with just six per cent of state schools.“In such circumstances, it is disappointing that the independent school sector’s offer of assistance has been ignored,” Mr King said in his letter to the Education Secretary.“Given the key role that the private sector has played in the country’s response to the pandemic – such as private hospitals alleviating bed capacity issues and private industry tackling the shortfall in ventilators – the Government’s reluctance to accept help from the private education sector is even more frustrating.”Ministers have faced criticism over their failure to reopen schools ahead of shops, cinemas, theme parks and zoos.Downing Street has come under fire over its handling of reopening schools, having rowed back on plans to get all primary school pupils back to the classroom before the summer, then later said it would encourage this after all.Earlier this month, new official guidance said every secondary school pupil in England will be allowed to return to school before the summer, but only for one day. Previously, officials had said only Year 10 and Year 12 pupils would be allowed back before the summer.Mr King said that private schools have built up a great deal of expertise in how to deliver effective online learning, and now to get children safely back to the classroom.“Online learning has been a huge success right across the private sector, the contrast with state schools is quite stark,” he said. “The overwhelming majority of our schools are now open to all year groups which is pretty impressive given the wider picture.”Mr King added that private school heads are “only too willing” to lend their expertise as well as resources to the state education sector.The Government will announce next week that social distancing will not be applied in schools and bubbles will be expanded to enable all pupils to return to their classes full-time in September.Pupils will not be expected to keep two metres or even one metre apart at all times while in school buildings, it is understood. Instead, schools will be asked to focus on limiting the extent to which children mix outside their class or year group and on implementing strict hygiene regimes.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Our £1 billion Covid catch-up package will directly tackle the impact of lost teaching time as a result of the pandemic, which headteachers and school leaders have the flexibility to decide how to spend. Some may use this funding to provide summer school activities for their pupils.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/24/16/coronavirus-lockdown-internet-use.jpg","title":"coronavirus internet use uk lockdown facebook google","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0027Lockdown\u0026nbspmay leave a lasting digital legacy,\u0027 says Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and researchPeople in the UK have been spending record amounts of time on the internet during the coronavirus lockdown, new data has revealed.In April 2020, UK adults spent longer than four hours online each day – more than a quarter of their waking life.It marks an increase of more than half an hour since January and means people now spend substantially more time online than watching television or listening to the radio.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe figures were revealed in Ofcom’s Online Nation report, which detailed the habits and trends of internet users between November 2019 and April 2020.People aged 18 to 24 were the most heavy users, clocking an average of more than five hours spent online per day.A large portion of the study focussed on internet habits in 2019, which revealed that technology giants now control an even greater share of internet traffic.The research by the regulator showed that more than a third of time spent online was spent on sites owned by either Facebook or Google.The shift towards platforms like Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Messenger appears to have been accelerated during lockdown, with nearly half of all adults using the messaging apps to make video calls at least once a week.Data shows Trump is wrong about US doing more Covid-19 testingOfcom\u0027s research found that the use of video calling services doubled to 70 per cent of the population during the lockdown, as people sought new ways to stay in touch.One of the biggest benefiters from this trend has been the app Zoom, which saw a huge surge in new users at the start of the lockdown.Lockdown may leave a lasting digital legacy, said Yij-Choung Teh, Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and research.Coronavirus has radically changed the way we live, work and communicate online, with millions of people using online video services for the first time.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The lost item posed no risk to the astronauts, spacewalk or the station, Nasa said.Nasa renaming headquarters in honour of first black female engineerSpacewalking astronauts wear a wrist mirror on each sleeve to get better views while working. The mirror is just 5 inches by 3 inches, and together with its band has a mass of barely one-tenth of a pound.Cassidy and Bob Behnken, who followed him out without mishap, were conducting the first of at least four spacewalks to replace the last bunch of old station batteries.Once the six new lithium-ion batteries are installed, the orbiting lab should be good for the rest of its operational life, according to NASA. The big, boxy batteries — more powerful and efficient than the old nickel-hydrogen batteries coming out — keep the station humming when it\u0027s on the night side of Earth.The battery replacements began in 2017, with previous crews putting in 18 lithium-ion batteries, half as many as the old ones replaced.Cassidy and Behnken have six more to plug in before the job is complete. It\u0027s cumbersome work: Each battery is about a yard (meter) tall and wide, with a mass of 400 pounds (180 kilograms).Their spacewalks are expected to continue through July before Behnken returns to Earth in August aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort.

Residents on the southwest coast, in Plymouth, Devon, also woke to find the detritus left behind in the city’s popular Barbican area overnight – where hundreds of people packed onto the waterfront, ignoring coronavirus social distancing rules.The streets were covered in rubbish this morning, including tampons and used condoms, Plymouth Live reports.Residents were also reportedly faced with people having sex in public, as well as urinating and defecating in back streets.

Today there was also evidence of drug use.  “Thank you to the park rangers who are also working tirelessly to clear the mess around the ground and park generally.”A suitcase, parasol and fridge were among items abandoned on beaches in Durdle Door, Dorset, where volunteers filled more than 30 bags with rubbish. Dorset councillor Laura Miller tweeted: “Is it still ‘iconic’? Just in from volunteer litter picking. 30 bin bags and counting. Nearly in tears at the state of our home.”She also shared an image of what she described as human faeces on pebbles near where her children swim at Lulworth Cove. The Conservative councillor said she was spat at by someone while directing traffic on Wednesday as the roads to Durdle Door and West Lulworth were closed off after car parks quickly filled up. Police imposed a dispersal order at Hove Lawns, in Sussex, after a fight reportedly broke out as hundreds of, mostly young, people gathered on Wednesday evening.Jo Shiner, temporary Chief Constable of Sussex Police, described the incident as “shocking behaviour impacting upon everyone trying to be responsible in challenging times”. She warned: “Sussex Police will take positive action but I would urge young people to think about their behaviour. A criminal record will not help you get a job in the future.” Video journalist Eddie Mitchell shared footage on Twitter showing several police cars lined up along the seafront as uniformed officers herded crowds away.Police in Merseyside also imposed a 48-hour dispersal order lasting until Friday after large crowds turned up at Formby Beach, on the Sefton coastline.

They left A LOT of rubbish and were only dispersed about 10 minutes ago.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

But\u0026nbspthe unprecedented circumstances could not dampen spirits, Colin Drury findsThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Not long after Liverpool had won their last league title back in 1990, Harvey Morrison’s older brother mentioned to the then 12-year-old how the club’s northwest rivals Manchester United had not been champions for more than 20 years.“I said to him, ‘Twenty years? That’s ancient history’,” he recalls today. “I went, ‘That could never happen to us’.”The Anfield season ticket-holder thought about this conversation while sat alone on his doorstep at 1am on Friday morning.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree hours earlier, the Reds – once the dominant force in English football – had been crowned champions for the first time since that 1990 success.In the celebrations that followed, almost everyone on Morrison’s Bootle street flooded into their gardens to sing and cheer. Most put up flags and bunting. Harvey’s son, 7-year-old Tom, brought out a life-sized cutout of Mo Salah and stuck it in the front lawn. Someone a couple of roads along was letting off fireworks.Liverpool fans celebrate winning first title in 30 years“But when it was all done and we’d got the kids in bed, I just needed a moment to myself,” says the father-of-two.He sat out in the warm night with his last beer of the evening. “I was trying to savour it, mate,” he says. “Thirty years I’ve been waiting for this. It was overwhelming.”Did he cry? “No comment. Let’s just say I was emotional.”Such stories – of cheers, beers and tears – come thick and fast in Liverpool on Friday, the day after the glorious night before.This may be a country still officially in coronavirus lockdown – the pubs were shut and Anfield remained locked up – but such restrictions did not dampen spirits here. An estimated 2,000 fans had turned up at the stadium to toast the title on Thursday night, while hundreds more had descended on the squares and parks of the city centre. Those who followed lockdown guidelines and stayed at home – the majority it’s worth saying – turned suburban streets into late-night carnivals.“Come head, mate,” one lad, Mike Pinnington, a 21-year-old railway worker, had told The Independent in the city’s Concert Square. “It would have had to be the plague to stop us having a bevvy a night like this.”By the next day, it was clear this was not a unique view: after three decades – as well as a wait of 14 weeks while the season was suspended due to the Covid-19 crisis – the release was palpable. On Friday, Liverpool was a city of sore heads and shadows lifted.“When I was leaving the house this morning, I saw a neighbour just getting home,” said Morrison, a council transport officer, as we spoke in the city’s Liverpool One complex. “That was 9am. I’m not sure where he’d been all night. He wasn’t in the best state to talk.”The unbridled joy was perhaps because this felt bigger than mere sport.Liverpool is a place whose identity is entwined with its club. For it not to have topped the English league for 30 years was a burden here. In a city which has long struggled with deprivation – one in three children live in poverty in Merseyside according to a 2019 report – the fall from grace of their mighty football club had felt, to many, like insult added to injury.“It’s massive,” said Scott Craven, a 21-year-old joiner. “It puts a spring in the city’s step. You look round and people are happy.”Even Evertonians? “They might as well be happy about it because they’re never going to win the league themselves.”Many believed that this was now the beginning of a new golden period for the Reds.“The start of an era,” as Mo Abdul, a research scientist who spent the night with hundreds of fans gathered outside St Luke’s bombed-out church, put it.That may be but some fear it may also be the start of a second coronavirus spike. Concerns have already been raised that the spontaneous gatherings – where social distancing was decidedly not observed – could ultimately end up going down in history as a series of super-spreader events. Certainly, city authorities and club manager Jurgen Klopp have now urged fans (again) to hold off holding further celebrations.“I agree with that,” said Abdul, 25. “Perhaps there should have been more social distancing last night. But I think people got caught up in the moment. We’re a city obsessed with football. No one’s saying there should be a bus parade until it’s safe but this was just a release, I think.”It was a view shared by Carl McDonald, a Liverpool fan and A\u0026ampE care assistant who had been working the night shift at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital.“We had a couple of people come in who’d been hurt falling off things they’d been climbing,” the 38-year-old said with a shrug: “It happens”.As a supporter and NHS worker, how did he feel about the mass celebrations? “I’d preferred them not to have happened,” he replied. “I’ve seen what coronavirus does to you. But people have been waiting to win the Premiership for so long – I think it would have been hard to stop.”He himself was able to keep up with the night’s unfolding events because patients across his wards were listening to the all-important Man City match. It was their defeat to Chelsea which sealed the Reds title. “I had to stop myself shouting out when Chelsea scored,” he noted.Katrina and Abigail Baybutt had no such concerns.The mother and daughter – who have travelled across Europe supporting the club – watched the game at home. “We were pretty loud, pretty hyper,” said Katrina, a 42-year-old accounts officer and mother-of-three. “Jumping around the living room, texting friends, singing.”The kids, she means? “Mainly the kids, but perhaps me a little bit too.”Yet she admitted – in common with most fans here – that there was a tinge of sadness that this was not a normal season that the club will ultimately end up being presented with the trophy at a game which fans cannot attend. “It’s a real shame,” she said.“But it’s okay,” perked up Abigail, 14, as the pair started to make their way in to the Liverpool store. “It means we’ll just have to win it again next year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.The task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.He continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The rumours quickly spread among the Syrian fighters in Libya. A group of mercenaries recently hired by the internationally recognised Libyan government were in hospital with serious chest infections. Panic rippled through the ranks that it was the deadly coronavirus. No measures had been taken when they started their long trip from northern Syria via Turkey to Tripoli. No one had self-isolated, worn a mask or had a test.“We tried to find out more information but couldn’t,” said one fighter, among an estimated 6,000 Syrians employed to support Libya’s Government of National Accord (GNA), which is backed by Turkey. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe said his commanders were tightlipped about the incident. The GNA denied the rumours in a statement to The Independent. Instead its officials have blamed their foes – the forces of renegade general Khalifa Haftar – of spreading Covid-19 through their own foreign mercenaries. “There are no precautions taken here for fighters, it’s like coronavirus doesn’t exist,” the fighter lamented.  Wars have ravaged healthcare systems across the Middle East and North Africa, leaving several countries extremely susceptible to outbreaks of Covid-19. But world health officials are now concerned about a new secret spreader of the disease: combatants. Over the past few months, as the pandemic swept across the globe, swathes of soldiers, fighters and mercenaries from countries such as Syria, Turkey, Iran and Iraq have been deployed to frontlines across the region, despite the fact that their cross-border journeys break international lockdowns and travel restrictions.Little to no care has been taken to mitigate this potentially devastating transmission of the disease even though many of these countries are among the most vulnerable to the pandemic. The secretive nature of their movement makes contact tracing impossible.  Officials from the World Health Organisation and other United Nations bodies have all sounded the alarm, telling The Independent that with such little information and testing, there is no way to accurately measure what damage might have been done. They say local efforts to stamp out the disease will be undermined by the continued international movement of troops, prolonging and deepening existing outbreaks or even creating new clusters. “Clearly you want to control public health measures at border crossings, airports and ports,” said Richard Brennan, acting regional emergency director for WHO’s eastern Mediterranean regional office. “Ideally, you would be screening people and enforcing quarantines.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now there are armed groups coming in, without screening, no quarantining and no tracking in the country. This is exactly the kind of the way the disease can spread unchecked.” He said it was a problem across the region, made worse by the fact that combatants then moved around the countries they had travelled to.  Libya, meanwhile, has morphed into the world’s newest proxy war with a huge influx of combatants into the country despite coronavirus lockdowns. UN investigators, those across Libya and Syria as well as the fighters themselves, estimate that well over 10,000 Syrians fighters have travelled to fight on both sides of Libya’s conflict since January. That deployment accelerated through the spring just as Covid-19 gripped the world. Thousands of Syrians from opposition areas sent to fight for the GNA have travelled through Turkey, a country with one of the worst outbreaks in the region. Turkey has had more than 190,000 Covid-19 cases and 5,000 deaths. A new brigade of Syrian fighters reportedly arrived just last week, according to sources in Syria and Libya.  UN investigators, meanwhile, say at least 2,000 Syrians from pro-regime areas have been hired via Russian companies to fight for General Haftar in the east of the country. The Independent was able to track a surge in recruitment of Syrian mercenaries to General Haftar’s ranks as late as mid-May in the middle of the pandemic. Forces allegedly continue to be recruited this week. On Wednesday, Libya’s National Centre for Disease Control announced its biggest daily increase yet in coronavirus infections and deaths. Nearly 700 cases have now been counted, and 18 deaths.But without proper contact tracing and tests, it is impossible to confirm the true rate of the outbreak in Libya or whether there is a link between the flood of foreign troops and the spike in cases. There is already little capacity to do that in many places like Libya. Now there are armed groups coming in, without screening, no quarantining and no tracking in the country, this is exactly the kind of the way the disease can spread uncheckedHowever, UN officials have warned the cross-border movement of combatants poses a substantial risk for the country where hospitals have been bombed, and there are shortages of personal protective equipment, ventilators and Covid-19 tests. “Our view is that Libya has not reached the peak of the threat of the coronavirus,” Stephanie Williams, deputy chief of the UN’s support mission in Libya (Unsmil) told The Independent. “There’s not enough testing. There is minimal containment. Yet there are continuing flights into Libya.” Health officials have expressed similar concerns about foreign troops travelling to fight in other parts of the region, including in Syria’s own deeply complex civil war.Turkey has deployed troops to opposition-held areas of Syria since 2016 to back rebels against President Bashar al-Assad, who is supported by Iran, Russia and Iranian-backed paramilitary groups from Lebanon and Iraq. Thousands of Turkish troops, police, municipal officials, and employees of the government and charities cross in and out of Syria every day. Rahmi Dogan, the governor of the southern province of Hatay, admitted at the start of the month that 140 soldiers and police officers working in the opposition-held Syrian cities of Afrin and Idlib, had contracted the coronavirus. Libya’s general Haftar swindled out of millions by western mercenariesThe news, reported in both Turkish and Syrian media, has sparked panic among Syrian residents and fighters in the Idlib and western Aleppo area, where there is a woeful lack of personal protective equipment, ventilators and just one testing machine for the four million people who live there. Many civilians are displaced from other parts of Syria and so live in overcrowded, unhygienic camps, leaving them particularly vulnerable to the disease. The Turkish authorities have maintained that they immediately isolated and evacuated those in northern Syria who contracted the coronavirus. They promised to minimise troop movement in the operation zone.But within the war-ravaged area, Syrian residents say vulnerable families have no access to healthcare and so are keeping their distance from Turkish soldiers.“We are afraid of transmission of Covid-19, the virus can only have come to the north of Syria when the Turkish units switch shifts,” said Mohamed Abdullah, one Syrian rebel. “There were cases detected in Afrin and Mastuma camp.”Meanwhile, in regime-held areas of Deir Ezzor to the east, there have been multiple unconfirmed reports about outbreaks of Covid-19 among forces that hail from Iran and Iraq, two countries that are struggling to stamp out huge outbreaks. Daniel al-Furati, who is from Deir Ezzor, said over the last few months crossings with Iraq “remain entirely open” for Iranian and Iraqi militiamen who are fighting on the side of the Syrian regime.“Those groups came into contact with the local pro-government brigades,” he said. “They are infected and transmit the coronavirus to the population there.”Deir Ezzor 24, a local activist collective, also reported this phenomenon. They accused Assad’s forces of enforcing a “media blackout” on the origins of Covid-19 infections there.Without testing it is again impossible to confirm. The Syrian regime has denied outbreaks in the eastern border area.Far from addressing public health concerns of combatants flowing in and out of warzones during the pandemic, belligerents are trading accusations over the spreading of the coronavirus.  Libyan health officials in Tripoli have repeatedly accused Haftar’s Libyan Arab Armed Forces (LAAF) of spreading the virus through its mercenaries, which according to the United States Africa Command and UN investigators include 2,000 Russians, 2,000 Syrians and 2,000 Sudanese. GNA health ministry spokesperson Ameen al-Hashimi told The Independent that the authorities had been anxiously following dozens of flights allegedly carrying Syrian and possibly Russian mercenaries from Syria to east Libya this year.“When we contacted the health authorities in the east they said that their troops were not subject to any health analyses or quarantines and were sent directly to the frontlines in west Libya, which poses a danger to citizens,” Mr Hashimi said.He said sources in the east had also told them several foreign nationals including Russians and Syrians had been isolated over the last few months with Covid-19 symptoms. The LAAF, which vehemently denies having foreign fighters among its ranks, threw similar accusations at the GNA, saying it was “ironic” that the Tripoli government was complaining about the coronavirus.“We are worried about the virus among the Syrian mercenaries the GNA has deployed,” one LAAF spokesman told The Independent. He said that they had received reports of at least 17 Syrian mercenaries being hospitalised with the virus two months ago, echoing rumours The Independent had also been told.  The tidal surge of forces has not abated. Sources in northern Syria told The Independent that hundreds of Syrian fighters had crossed into Turkey ready to be sent to Tripoli for the GNA in the coming days – despite a recent surge in coronavirus in Turkey over the last few weeks. Syrian fighters already in Libya said there was regular back and forth between the two countries as brigades were sent home and fresh recruits were brought over in a kind of “changing of the guard”. This was also reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which claimed as many as 1,800 have arrived in Turkey to undergo military training ready to fly to Libya while 2,600 have returned to Syria from Libya this month alone. “No one cares about coronavirus here,” said one Syrian mercenary in west Libya. “We had no lockdown, no measures in place, no masks, no testing, no hand sanitisers. It’s like it didn’t happen.”While anyone can spread coronavirus, Covid-19 symptoms tend to most badly afflict the elderly and the infirm, while mostly sparing the young athletic men in their 20s and 30s who make up the bulk of warriors in combat zones.  Another asked about coronavirus measures was sanguine. “It isn’t something we are thinking about,” he said. “We are more worried about being shot.” Read the first part of the Soldiers of Misfortune series here: Libya’s beleaguered general Haftar swindled out of millions by western mercenaries and businessmen, and the second part here: Inside the murky world of Libya’s mercenariessoldiers of misfortune\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Coronavirus lockdowns are lifting around the world, raising concerns that it could trigger a new wave of infections.Some countries that experienced a significant drop in new Covid-19 cases in April and May are now beginning to experience an uptick in confirmed daily cases.The concerning trend can be seen in several countries throughout the Middle East, most notably in Iran where new cases briefly dropped below 1,000 in early May but have now more than doubled.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIran was one of the first countries to experience a significant outbreak of the deadly virus, with close to 200,000 total cases recorded.Looking at a smoothed seven-day rolling average for new daily cases, Iran\u0027s second wave came almost exactly one month after the first wave.The data suggests that Iran may have already reached the peak of its second wave and is now on the decline.Other countries in the region appear to be experiencing a more gradual second wave, with official figures from Israel revealing that new coronavirus cases have been rising consistently for the past three weeks.Israel\u0027s second wave remains a long way off the peak of the first wave, and the country remains one of the least affected in the Middle East.In Saudi Arabia, new cases are rising at record rates despite briefly appearing to peak in late May.The false peak means the latest surge of new cases could be counted as a continuation of the first wave, rather than a new second wave.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Prime Minister announced that we were at last allowed out of our Great British Hibernation.We can go to the pub, buy useless tat in shops and queue up for plaster lawn ornaments from garden centres. We can have the in-laws round to visit! Yoot!⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesBoris says that his decision was made on good scientic advice. Hmm, maybe. It is true that the infection rate for Covid has been dropping rapidly for some time. But it’s still there, still hanging around with mischief on its mind. All it takes is one person in a gathering of  or  at some pizza joint and that infection rate will be up again quickly enough.In some of the countries that have released their people from lockdown, a second spike has occurred.In Germany the famous “R” rate for infection is well above the dreaded one. South Korea and Spain have seen new outbreaks, too.But the truth is Boris didn’t have much of an option. The public is bored stf and the economy is wrecked.I suspect the decision was arrived at on those grounds, rather than strictly on the science. Everyone wants to go out and spend money. I am not sure why they do.  There were good things about lockdown — and it taught us one or two truths about ourselves.It was a pleasure to hear the birds singing, for example. A real delight to see the roads free from traffic. The skies are full of swts and swallows instead of the incessant airline flights. The quality of the air we breathe improved hugely as a result. So did the water quality of rivers and streams.We went out much, much less. As a consequence, many people saved an awful lot of money because they weren’t wasting it on buying rubbish from shops.People learned to cook — and ate home-prepared meals with their families. The truth is, in normal times, we eat out far more often than is good for us, financially or otherwise. And we shopped locally — the corner stores did a roaring trade — and less often, thus saving carbon emissions.Employers discovered that people could work from home perfectly well. Hopefully this will persuade some to scale back their offices and give people the chance to work from home.Imagine how many homes could be created from disused offices! We wouldn’t have to pave over half the country to sort out our housing crisis. Imagine cutting out the daily commute for ever!We didn’t have to hug people. Indeed, we were barred by law from hugging people. Or kissing them on the bloody cheek, like everyone in the media world does. That, by itself, was a huge bonus for me.My wish is that we take some of that stuff from lockdown and make it the new normal. Live at a quieter, gentler pace. Continue to eat at home — and support our local corner shops. Use the car less. Spend less money on a whole load of b******s we don’t really need. Use aeroplanes not at all, preferably. Right now, the Government has given us licence to go out and do stuff.Here’s my plea. Let’s do a bit less stuff than we used to. Let’s remain kind of half in and half out of lockdown. Whether Covid is still around or not. We’ll end up happier as a result.ONE thing Captain Tom showed us, as he walked around his garden as he approached the age of , is that it’s never too late to make a dference.Bob Dylan is just a young whippersnapper by Tom’s standards.But at the age of  he has just made his finest album in at least three decades, and probably more. Rough And Rowdy Ways is a joy to listen to – and I’d given up on the bloke in the s.If I ever reach  I intend to make a grime album with Rihanna. Get your orders in now.The United Nations has decided to give them to Mauritius. That’s because the islands are nearer Mauritius than they are to the UK. On that basis we could have a good claim to owning Belgium. The islands are important to the UK militarily. And we should keep them. The UN has given us deadlines to hand them over to a country that never owned them. What we should do instead is leave the crooked UN.EXCLUDED from the Government’s loosening of lockdown are Britain’s vibrant community of werewolves and vampires.“It is all very well biting someone’s neck, or ripping their lungs out while howling loudly,” a scientist advising the Government probably said. “But when they do this there is the risk that the virus could be passed on via droplets from the creature’s mouth. Or indeed paws – werewolves do not have a good record of using hand-sanitiser.”By contrast, zombies were praised for their social-distancing technique. “Whenever you see them they are always walking two metres apart with their hands outstretched and bits of flesh falling off their faces,” the same scientist probably added.A spokesman for the National Association of Lycanthropescommented: “This is typical of the prejudice we werewolves face and amounts to discrimination. Actually, I thought I had the virus a few weeks ago. Nasty cough and so on.“But I’m all right nooooowwwwwwooooo.”THE day after the woke ninnies at Warners withdrew the great Hollywood film Gone With The Wind because of “race issues”, guess what happened  Yup, it became the No bestselling film on Amazon. Better still, it reached No in the AppleiTunes chart for TV and film. Not bad for a movie made more than  years ago, huh I suppose it could have been “progressives” buying the film so that they would have something to be outraged about. Or maybe the Ku Klux Klan Film Club has a bigger membership than we thought.More likely though is that people loathe censorship. They don’t like being told what they can and can’t watch. Truth be told it hasn’t been for a good  years. And the process accelerated under Magic Grandpa and his front bench of mouth-breathing dingbats. Now it’s the well-orf who support Labour. And the poor who vote Conservative. But there aren’t enough people called Olly and Poppy in the country, which is why Labour hasn’t won an election for  years. Unless it reconnects with the people it was set up to support, the working class, it won’t win one for another few decades either.A SOCIAL media site had a big hit when it asked people to reveal things they regretted about getting married. The site, Whisper, was inundated with replies. Most were kind of: “I just wish I hadn’t married the fat bastard, full stop.”But some wished they’d had a fling with someone of the same sex first, or felt aggrieved they hadn’t checked out the in-laws first. That was quite a big issue.

The Seventies brought Led Zeppelin and countless rock bands, it gave us heavy metal and punk and Joy Division pretty much all at the same time.The biggest-selling album of the Eighties, Michael Jackson’s Thriller, was actually written by a bloke from Hull, while British greats as erse as Duran Duran and The Smiths ruled the waves.In the Cool Britannia of the Nineties, when Britpop was ringing out of radio networks worldwide, even American stars such as Madonna sought help from British producers such as Nellee Hooper and William Orbit.Then there were the Spice Girls. And Coldplay. Now we’ve got Ed Sheeran and Adele. And it doesn’t stop with artists. Love him or hate him, Simon Cowell’s TV programmes are another British global music phenomenon.But it’s live music where Britain really dominates today. Glastonbury should be taking place this weekend.I’ve played at just about every major festival on the planet, from Coachella in the US to Fuji Rock in Japan, but there is nowhere to touch Glastonbury.It is, quite simply, the greatest show on earth There is a massive ripple effect from Glastonbury. It sets a very high bar for the other  — that’s  — festivals that happen throughout the UK every single summer.And the same crews who build the stages, operate the sound systems, put up the fences and supply the bogs for Glasto are busy for the rest of the summer at other events.Now the independent festival sector is at risk of collapse thanks to the Covid shutdown.Last month, the Association of Independent Festivals , which represents  festivals in the UK, reported that  per cent of its members were facing costs that could ruin their businesses and . per cent were uninsured for Covid- related cancellations.Most of my time these days is spent planning and organising The Big Feastival, which was due to take place here on my farm in Oxfordshire this August Bank Holiday weekend.Of course I’m devastated it won’t be going ahead, but the really sad thing is that it looks like no one is going to hear any live music, new or old this summer.That’s a tragedy for the musicians who rely on gigging to make a living — as well as all the other people whose income relies on live music.The Musicians’ Union says its members have lost more than £million in income during the lockdown. Remember, that most musicians just scrape by at the best of times.Big stars are bigger than ever before, but they are the exception not the rule. When Adele releases another record there is a danger she will become so massive she will collapse into a black hole.But now bands need an audience to play to and also financial support, which used to come from record companies but now is hard to find.Records, or downloads, are basically free these days, so live shows are the only real way to make money.In the same way restaurants were already struggling before lockdown, many of Britain’s smaller live music venues were struggling too.So most of the places I played in the early days with Blur have already dis- appeared. They need to be able to open their doors again, as do festivals.It has to be possible to find a way. Just as with pubs, restaurants and cinemas, you could limit the number of people allowed into a venue.Perhaps more gigs could be seated to ensure social distancing. Not quite the same, but better than nothing.As far as the rest of the planet is concerned, Britain is represented pretty much by the Royal Family, football and music.We must keep our festival circuit alive and nurture new artists.That means we urgently have to find a way for music to be played to a live audience, evenit’s only a small one — so that we can keep meaning something to the rest of the world.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But his determination to do what is right by the children made the real dference.Contrast that with the union militants and council leaders of the Left. Although the Government could have done better in prioritising education, the wrecking crew have revelled in  confronting and defying the Tories, blocking efforts to reopen fully.Even now, the PM’s announcement that schools must open in September is branded “pure fantasy” by one union.We do not yet know the true cost to our children’s education, le chances and health from this failure of will. The unions have betrayed our kids and tarnished the image of the teachers they represent and who would love to get back to the classroom.PUBS with no music, singing, dancing or shouting  That’s just a library with more beer and no books.And how about visor-clad hairdressers snipping in enforced silence, with no gossip or radio It all sounds like a sci-fi dystopia of Britain. But this is the Government’s vision for our summer as it tries to save businesses while keeping us safe.To which we say: Well, good luck with that. We understand the reasoning. The scientists say all these activities pass on Covid in the breath. And they are desperate to avoid a new surge in cases.Some might see little point in a pub with the le sucked out of it.

I mean, I’ve only been able to see Dear Evan Hansen  times so far.And Christmas won’t be the same without the uniquely British tradition of the winter panto. How will all those former boyband stars fund their showbiz lestyles for another year Sadly, post-Covid restrictions look particularly cruel to the arts.Those dastardly droplets mean singing is banned and the idea of packing out a historic theatre where the tiny seats mean you are virtually sitting on top of your neighbour just won’t cut it.But in the middle of an international health emergency it’s all too easy to dismiss the importance of stage shows, movies, the TV industry, festivals and concerts.The attitude seems to be: “We’re dying, goddammit, the economy is cratering, don’t talk to me about the bloody theatre!”But that approach will mean Britain is cakewalking into a cultural catastrophe that could wipe off decades of creative progress, end our modern domination of the arts and entertainment and see the closure of most historic theatres before the end of the year.If that is yet another horrid consequence of Covid-, a disease most likely spread because of a despicable Chinese wet market, I will be fuming.Dame Judi Denchs warning that theatres may not open again in her letime is as stark as it is horrying.It would wipe out £.billion of annual ticket sales, see , good folk lose their jobs and damage tourism.While the pressure is building by the day on the Government to launch yet another unprecedented rescue package, I think that’s only part of the answer.Entertainment is a big-money industry dominated by super-wealthy moguls who have a responsibility to look after as many of their loyal staff and young creatives as humanly possible.Now is the time for other celebrities and businesspeople who have earned a small fortune from the creative industries to give back.Where are all those Hollywood stars, with hundreds of millions in the bank, who rush to perform on the West End stage to be seen as a real actor, dahling Surely they could donate a tiny portion of their wealth to set up a private rescue fund for theatres For example, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the South Park creators who are behind The Book Of Mormon, are worth a billion bucks.JK Rowling, whose Harry Potter play The Cursed Child is at the Palace Theatre, has a £million fortune.We Will Rock You producer Robert de Niro has £million in the bank, Sister Act producer and star Whoopi Goldberg £million, and West End favourite Dame Helen Mirren £million.I could name a hundred other multi-millionaire stars who have used the West End to enhance their careers who owe it to the backroom staff on the breadline to be part of the solution.Thankfully, the king of theatre — Lord Lloyd-Webber — has, as ever, proved inspirational and innovative.Without being asked, he is putting his money where his mouth is to PROVE to the Government that it is possible to safely reopen theatres WITHOUT ANY social distancing by using enhanced precautions such as temperature checks on the door and face masks for all audience members.The Government must listen to him and embrace his case study of Phantom Of The Opera, which has remained open in South Korea throughout the pandemic with no issues.Otherwise, we risk the curtain coming down for good.BACKING down so quickly on extending Sunday trading hours was a disappointing move forced by Tory backbenchers.While on first glance the idea of allowing supermarkets and other shops to stay open longer on our day of rest sounds unappealing to many workers, the reality is that this change would have probably saved many jobs in the long run.It’s nonsensical that on one day of the week most Tescos can only open for six hours, while international delivery services such as Amazon continue to decimate their business, especially now with social-distancing measures making it even more unappealing to spend time lining up outside.By contrast, the other night I was able to order an Amazon Prime Now delivery to arrive at my house at pm on a Sunday night.I’d ordered an Uber Eats takeaway from McDonald’s two hours earlier.The archaic current trading hours laws were introduced in , the year Jeff Bezos created a fledgling online book store called Amazon.Like it or not, that business has created a dferent world of consumerism.Compromises to allow workers the option not to take on more Sunday work, leaving the additional hours to those who want to earn extra cash, could make the necessary move more palatable.But let’s not avoid having the debate.THE Culture Secretary has so much on his plate that Shirley Ballas used an innovative approach to attract his attention this week – and it worked.Launching an impassioned plea to Oliver Dowden to “safely open” ballroom dance studios on my talkRADIO Drivetime show, the Strictly Come Dancing judge teased: “If Oliver is out there, I don’t even mind having a cha-cha-cha with him to show him it is possible to social distance.”Clearly the power of the Queen of Latin remains undiminished.Within hours, Oliver had tweeted: “Shirley, as a Strictly fan, I’m happy to talk about how we can get dancing going safely again. Great offer on the cha-cha-cha – I’ll get practising.”Expect dance studios to be back in business imminently, then.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Being from the UK, it’s one of those gigs I think everyone wants to do. Hopefully next year.“But no f***ing way am I camping. No way. I’d have to build a house for it to work.“I’ve been to so many festivals with my mates but I’ve not done any camping stuff.“I’ve got the worst OCD so I wouldn’t be camping at all. That’s probably why I don’t have crazy stories from festivals.”Essex-born Jonas, whose real name is Guy James Robin, has cemented himself as one of the biggest names in dance music in the past five years, selling more than million records.Today he’s back with summer anthem Naked, featuring US singer MAX, but it won’t be part of a bigger collection after he decided releasing full albums is no longer for him.Jonas said: “I’m not going to be doing an album any time soon. I really enjoy doing singles. I can move quickly with them, especially in the world that I’m in, because the trends are forever changing.“I’m not planning to saturate the market with loads of records, it’s just about putting Naked out and that being my biggest record to date, I hope.”Jonas hopes the song will be “uplting” for people as we come out of lockdown. But as someone who knows nightclubs better than anyone , he insisted there is no chance they can reopen anytime soon.He explained: “Clubs will not work, how can you tell , drunk people to stand a metre or two metres apart  It’s never going to f***ing work.“It wouldn’t work with meI’d had a few drinks. I wouldn’t even know what two metres is at that point.”SHE is usually a Glasto regular and it’s a good bet you will find her partying into the early hours, but Rita Ora will have to make do with her back garden this weekend.The How To Be Lonely singer shared this photo on Instagram while sunbathing at home in her bra in the scorching temperatures.But she didn’t put as much thought into what she’d be wearing as she would have doneshe was heading to Somerset.She captioned the snap: “Can’t find my bikini.”It must have been a welcome relief for her to get outside though, having spent lockdown working hard on new music.She posted another photo of her home studio, where it was C, and wrote: “Hope you are all having fun outside enjoying the sun, meanwhile we’re cutting vocals with no air con.”Just think about all the tunes you’ll have to perform by the time you hit Worthy Farm next year, Rita.The superstar had said her album would be coming in September but her manager has now confirmed it is being pushed back, partly because the coronavirus crisis prevented her from finishing it.Jonathan Dickins said: “It isn’t coming in September. It’ll be ready when it’s ready.“We’re all in the same boat. You’re doing stuff and then suddenly the world stops.“It’ll come when it’s ready. We have music but we’re still working.”It’s been five years since her third album  was released, while January will mark a decade since her breakthrough record  which sold million copies to become one of the biggest records of all time.If Adele has taught us anything with her music, it’s that it will certainly be worth the wait.LITTLE MIX’s Jesy Nelson probably wouldn’t get very far across Worthy Farm in these shoes.She showed off slippers made to look like her pet pooches on Instagram, amid hopes the girl group could be signed up for next year’s festival.They are expected to have released their sixth album by then and could be a perfect signing for a team eager for more female artists.Jesy said in : “We would love to do Glastonbury, it would be incredible for us to do that. I think we’d be able to get a new audience that maybe we don’t have, people who aren’t too sure about Little Mix. We could prove them wrong, change their mind.”The singer, whose song Blue Jumper is out today, was picked up while supporting the band on tour but almost didn’t get to play for a music boss in the crowd.She said: “I’d gone over a little bit on my set. I was about to do my one hit and the stage director said, ‘You need to finish now’.“The head of Universal had just arrived. Richard ran over and was like, ‘No, let her play another’.”FOO FIGHTERS’ incredible  headline set is among a load of performances stream-ing through iPlayer over the weekend. You can also see Beyonce, David Bowie, Blur, George Ezra, Arctic Monkeys and more.THIS year’s festival was due to be the biggest yet but organiser Emily Eavis has insisted ticket holders are in for a bumper event when it s next year.She said they are hoping to roll over much of this year’s line-up, but had already booked loads of acts for , which may even mean making the festival longer.Emily said: “We’re rolling two festivals together for . We’ve got a hell of a lot of surprises and things that we were planning for the thand we’re going to try to get those things going for next year.“Logistically it’s a little bit complicated because we’d already pencilled in many of the acts for . It was one of those very unusual years where you’re quite far ahead, two years ahead, on the line-up. So we’re trying to work out how much we can fit into next year.“We’ve had lots of amazing letters from people with ideas of how we could make it into like a two-week holiday or run over three weekends. There’s lots of ideas going.”Taylor Swt Kendrick Lamar and Sir Paul McCartney were due to headline this weekend and Emily is hoping they will all be back, especially Beatles legend Paul.She said on BBC  Music: “I really hope he’ll be back next year singing it from the Pyramid and we’ll all be in tears, going, ‘It’s happened, we’re back’.”Me too.SIMON BOYLE - COLDPLAY : THEIR fourth time as headline act and they proved to be one of the greatest ever. CHRIS MARTIN and co won over even the most sceptical festivalgoer and had people in tears with their performance, complete with confetti, light-up bracelets and fireworks.JOE KASPER - DAVE : IT wasn’t just his fantastic performance but meeting his fan Alex Mann, who he got up from the crowd to rap his song Thiago Silva. It was enough to convert workmates I had dragged along to become fans of the Mercury Prize winner and, dare I say, grime.HOWELL DAVIES - LORDE : AT only , she proved to be a cut above when she delivered a standout set, partly from within a huge glass box suspended on stage. The Kiwi’s rousing tracks were lapped up and her visuals included dancers, lasers and clouds of smoke.ELLIE HENMAN - LEWIS CAPALDI : THE moment he swaggered on dressed as Noel Gallagher, I knew this set would be my highlight.

Gradually build up time spent apart.Animals have sensitive noses and using pet-specic cleaning products in the home can be helpful to reduce their anxiety.Making sure there are no harsh smells will lower tension levels and allows your pet to relax. .Keep cat litter trays clean, and for very attached pets, especially puppies, leaving something with your scent on, like a T-shirt or old towel, can be soothing.Playing gentle music at a low volume can help to distract from any unfamiliar noises that may worry them.There are even pet podcasts available.Pets who knew le before lockdown should slip back into previous family routines eventually.Cats are already more solitary creatures, and dogs should cope wellyou prepare them properly.However, puppies that have only ever known lockdown, or dogs that have become too used to your company, may find it more challenging.A good way to help them adjust is by pretending to go back to work. Put on office clothes or a school unorm and act out your pre-lockdown morning routines.Go through the motions of leaving for work. Pick up your car keys, settle your pet, then close the door and leave them, evenyou only go and sit in the garden or take a walk.You might feel silly, but this can be really helpful for your pet, especiallythey have only ever seen you in your “off-duty”, stay-home outfits.When you come back in it’s vital that you wait until your pet is calm before greeting them, whether that takes five minutes or five hours.Don’t join in OTT celebrations or encourage reunion “zoomies”, as long- term this can enhance anxious behaviour and increase stress levels.By taking things slowly your pet won’t find the transition back to post-lockdown le too dficult.However,furry friends don’t seem to be settling well and you encounter signs of anxiety, such as toilet issues, high heart rates, constant chewing or scratching, it’s worth seeking advice from a qualied animal behaviourist apbc.org.uk or your vet.A remote camera can give clues to situations you might not be aware of, such as noises, that could be troubling your pet in your absence.With everyone at home constantly during lockdown, our pets may have struggled to rest properly.Cats famously like to snooze but dogs also need up to  hours of sleep a day and may have found lockdown exhausting.Sometimes pets are actually anxious because our constant company means they are over-tired and over-stimulated and now can’t think straight.For all pets it is up to us to ensure they are not disturbed when they are taking time out.Cats are generally good at taking themselves off to cat nap so just leave them to rest, but dogs often need a bit more help to switch off.Don’t fuss over them while they catch some sleep and help children to understand that when their best friend is snoozing, they need to be left in peace.For dogs in particular, lockdown may have changed their exercise routines dramatically, with some getting more frequent or far longer walks than previously.Start to readjust this now, to correlate daily timetables with your regular routines ing.If you normally walk your dog at specic times of the day, such as before and after work, then resume going for walkies on this schedule.Oryou normally use a dog walker or have help from another person during the day, make the effort to introduce them now, especiallyyou have a pet who hasn’t met them yet.If you are one of the many new pet owners who got a puppy or kitten during lockdown you’ve had a lovely honeymoon period to bond with your new buddy.However, it also means it’s likely your pet has never spent any time home alone.Before leaving you new addition solo, you must do sufficient training to ensure your puppy or kitten understands that being separated from you is OK.With puppies, build up slowly to ensure they are happy and get used to the idea of being handled by other people and socialising with other dogs.You can stay with your pupthey are more confident with you around but don’t allow them to be clingy and always reward positive, confident behaviour.For cats, six months is the ideal age to start training with a cat flapyou plan to use one.Professional help with training is now permitted again under government rules and is strongly advised.A bored pet can be an anxious pet. If they are under-stimulated their minds wander and your home can suffer the consequences – so keep them busy.For dogs, toys stuffed with treats, or scattering snacks into their bed to hunt, will give them something to do.There are also tutorials online for making home-made games and toys.For cats, include circuits and teasers to prevent your furniture being damaged.Rotate dferent ones daily, so there is always something new for your pet to investigate and play with.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their families were affected and they were having a discussion about it.Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan report catalogues a series of blunders made by the crew.Data from the flight recorders shows that the landing gear was selected as “down” during part of the planes descent.But later when the plane was much nearer to the ground the landing gear lever was selected as “up”. The reasons for this ‘gear up’ selection have not been determined cockpit-voice recordings reveal warnings that the landing-gear was not down were “disregarded”, says the inquiry.Air traffic controllers also failed to notice the wheels weren’t down.When the crew realised what had happened the pilots initially applied reverse-thrust and braking, as the engines scraped along the runway.They were unable to halt the plane to perform a ‘go around’ and take off as they belatedly put the landing gear down.The A initially climbed away, with its crew planning to make another approach but engines “failed one by one”, says the inquiry.The aircraft came down in a built-up area about ,m from the runway threshold.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You see a black Jesus, or a Chinese Jesus, or a Middle Eastern Jesus - which of course is the most accurate - or a Fijian Jesus, he said.His points were made in response to being askedthe “way the Western church portrays Jesus needs to be thought about again”.The clergyman told how monuments across the CofE, including Canterbury Cathedral, were being looked at “very carefully” to seethey all “should be there”. Rev Welby urged campaigners to show forgiveness for the “trespasses” of people immortalised in the form of statues, rather than tearing them down. He said: “We can only do thatweve got justice, which means the statue needs to be put in context. Some will have to come down.”He added: “Some names will have to change. I mean, the church, goodness me, you know, you just go around Canterbury Cathedral, theres monuments everywhere, or Westminster Abbey, and were looking at all that, and some will have to come down.“But yes, there can be forgiveness, I hope and pray as we come together, but onlytheres justice.“If we change the way we behave now, and say this was then and we learned from that, and change how were going to be in the future, internationally, as well.”Rev Welby said: “Were going to be looking very carefully and putting them in context and seeingthey all should be there.”He said it is “what people do at times like this,” adding: And its a good thing, but there has to be, for forgiveness, there has to be this turning round, this conversion, the Pope called it.“The change of heart that says we learned from them not to be like that, and to change the way we are in the future.”Dozens of sculptures line the walls of the magnicent Cathedral in Canterbury, ranging from William, Duke of Normandy to Queen Elizabeth II.It is unclear which statues will be reviewed, and Lambeth Palace did not immediately respond to request for clarication.In , retired medical artist Richard Neave recreated the face of Jesus by studying Semite skulls using modern-day forensic techniques.His portrait shows the Son of God may have had a wide face, dark eyes, a bushy beard and short curly hair, as well as a tanned complexion.These features would likely have been typical of Middle Eastern Jews in the Galilee area of northern Israel.Dr Neave stressed the portrait was that of an adult man living at the same time, in the same place as Jesus.The absence of a physical description of Jesus in the Bible has left his appearance open to suggestion with Caucasian men dominating likenesses of him in Western culture.The earliest depictions showed him as a typical Roman man, wearing a tunic with short hair and no beard - with his facial hair first said to have made an appearance in AD.Medieval art in Europe typically showed him with brown hair and pale skin - an image strengthened during the Renaissance, by works including Leonardo da Vinci The Last Supper painting.In  white American Ted Neeley played the Messiah in the film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Jesus Christ Superstar musical.In  white Brit Robert Powell played the lead role in TV show Jesus of Nazareth before American Jim Cavaziel played the figure in The Passion of the Christ.Jesus has also been depicted as Latino or an Aboriginal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its teeth shows it only ate plants and its arms suggest it would scratch for food on the ground,such as when looking for roots.Despite its massive size however, its not even the biggest wombat-like creature every found.Diprotodon has that honour, weighing in at an impressive ,kg - two tonnes - and surviving until at least , years ago.Dr Robin Beck, from The University of Salford, who led the study, said: Koalas and wombats are amazing animals.But animals like mukupirna show that their extinct relatives were even more extraordinary, and many of them were giants.He added: It tells us a lot about the evolution of wombats, koalas and their relatives.It is remarkable for its large size - this was clearly an impressive, powerful beast.The bones were discovered after drought and strong winds blew the surface of the dry salt lake bed.The freak conditions uncovered the remains of animals that died after getting stuck in the mud millions of years ago.Archaeologists used an acupuncture method to find the bones, pushing metal rods into the soft mud until they hit something hard before digging it up.Mukupirna is now the closest known relative of modern wombats, yet it is still so dferent scientists have given it its own family of creatures - mukupirnidae.It is likely the mega wombat vanished during a global climate sht which saw its scrubby rainforest home vanish.Lusher and more erse forests followed, which will have lead to climate conditions not suited for the mukupirnids.Professor Michael Archer of the University of New South Wales, who was part of the team that first uncovered the bones which have only just been identied in ,hailed it as a mysterious new beast.Julien Louys of Grfith University, who co-authored the study, said: The description of this new family fills a crucial missing piece to the ancient bestiary of Australia. It joins other weird and extinct marsupials from  million years ago, many of which we wouldn’t recognise today.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Good on you for speaking the truth!I am slightly nervous that standards are going to drop! Hopefully not!Another wrote: Well done Pauline Wood. The lack of support from some schools teachers has been a national disgrace. You should be reinstated immediately.One wrote: A head teacher with a backbone! Anyone in Sunderland should write to their MP and local media showing support for this common sense, straight talking, award nominated Head Teacher. Well done Pauline Wood.While another parent tweeted: I think Pauline Wood deserves a pat on the back for being honest. I work with teachers every day and I can guarantee some really are lazy. Some have not worked  hours a week let alone flat out.A former pupil also praised the headteacher, writing: Best HT ever!!! Speaking from my --year-old self. True inspiration, hard working, passionateand dedication to educating her pupils. Huge respect.Ms Wood was suspended after the interviewer read out text messages from parents worried about the level of support schools in general were offering their kids during the Covid- crisis. One suggested the idea all schools were working hard to help pupils was simply wrong.When asked for her opinion, Ms Wood replied: Yes, some teachers have been in [schools], but many have not been in at any time. Safety is paramount, but dont make out teachers have all been working flat out.She went on to say some teachers were working hard coming up with the most imaginative, amazing things but that others sit at home doing nothing - I wont defend those people.

Her reply was I just want everyone to be happy.So, paid full time, work less than half time, sod the children. I set up our learning , I directed staff to phone parents. You dont get to be outstanding easily, and its even harder to stay there.She added that the situation was disheartening, especially considering the great and sustained outcomes under my leadership.Under Ms Woods  year leadership, the school has gone from inadequate to outstanding.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Reverend Justin Welby insisted the church must not ignore the Black Lives Matter movement and said Christians should rethink how Jesus Christ is portrayed as a white man. He said this needs to be reviewed in light of anti-racism protests worldwide but added he did not want to throw out the past by moving forward. The Most Revd and Rt Hon Welby, th Archbishop of Canterbury, was asked whether Jesusapos characterisation needs to be looked at, appearing on BBCRadio aposs Today Programme. He said: Yes of course it does, this sense that God was white. You go into churches around the world and you donapost see a white Jesus. You see a black Jesus, a Chinese Jesus, a Middle Eastern Jesus, which is of course the most accurate, you see a Fijian Jesus. The Archbishop insisted he did not want to throw out the past but said the universality of Christ needs a rethink. He added: Jesus is portrayed in as many ways as there are cultures, languages and understandings.  And I donapost think that throwing out everything weaposve got in the past is the way to do it. But I do think saying aposthataposs not the Jesus who exists, thataposs not who we worshipapos, it is a reminder of the universality of the God who became fully human. Speaking last week, the Archbishop said that the church is looking at whether some statues need removing after a surge in support for the Black Lives Matter movement after the death of George Floyd.  Understanding justice as crucial to forgiveness, he stressed a need to learn from the past. When askedpeople should forgive the trespasses of those immortalised in the form of statues, rather than tearing them down, he said some will have to come down. He said: We can only do thatweaposve got justice, which means the statue needs to be put in context.  Some will have to come down. Some names will have to change. The church, goodness me you know, you just go around Canterbury Cathedral, there are monuments everywhere or Westminster Abbey, and weaposre looking at all that, and some will have to come down.

After Boo arrived, she started to gain weight which led the couple to believe they had been overfeeding the new addition to the family. But, when she was taken to the vet they learned that she was pregnant with a litter of six puppies. In the following weeks, Boo gave birth to the six puppies – and six more. Much to Audrey and Maynard’s shock they found themselves with even more competition for space inside the three-bedroom cottage that they shared with Audrey’s daughters and their boyfriends. Plumbing and heating engineer Maynard, , has been off work and Audrey, , paused her school receptionist job so they can provide care for the puppies.  Luckily, Georgia, , her boyfriend Bryn, , Billie, , and her partner Scott, , were on hand to provide assistance. The pups are now seven weeks old and will soon be going to brand new homes. There were  offers and the couple said they were able to choose to make sure that all go to suitable people. The family will – however – keep one called Lola. Audrey said: “We had three dogs, one was a labrador. She was only three but she had a degenerative disease and got really poorly. “When she died it left a big hole in our hearts so we decided to rescue another dog. I found the charity on Facebook, they rescue dogs from kill pounds in Serbia.They treat dogs like vermin there, it’s barbaric so we wanted to rescue one. “We met the charity at Cobham motorway services in Surrey and collected Boo. She had never been in a house before, on a settee, on a lead. She hated cars, noise, roads but loved us instantly as we did her. “But then she started getting fatter which we didn’t mind as we were spoiling her. But after about six weeks we thought aposshe’s really getting big nowapos and her shape had changed. We thought she may have a phantom pregnancy but our vet did an ultrasound scan and said she was pregnant and thought there were six pups.

Kate, , was so moved by the tragic le of nine-year-old Fraser Delf that she gave a sunflower in his memory. The blooms are the symbol of hospice care and was the favourite of Fraser, who suffered a rare genetic condition and died in January. His mum Carla, , said: “I’m speechless. We are very touched as a family that she has done this and will be going to see Fraser’s sunflower when we can. “Fraser was always quite girly, and he would have loved to have known a princess was planting a flower for him. He would be very honoured.”  Kate, who re-potted the plant, took it to The Nook, near Norwich, which is one of East Anglia Children’s Hospices. There the duchess, a patron of Each, helped create a new garden. The green-fingered mum of three, wearing a £ floral midi-dress and £ shoes, arrived with plants, fruit trees and herbs bought at a local garden centre and mucked in. She chatted to families who use Each services and revealed George, six, Charlotte, five, and Louis, two, were competing with each other over the flowers. She said: “The children are really enjoying growing their sunflowers, Louis’s is winning so George is a little grumpy about that.” Kate and the Duchess of Cornwall, , met Fraser’s parents Carla and Stuart and brother Stuie, , on a video call to mark Children’s Hospice Week, which ends today. Fraser spent his final seven weeks at Each in Milton, Cambs, and Carla said: “Telling them about Fraser brought up mixed emotions.We call him our shining star.” Her little boy opened his eyes for the last time to see his parents renew their wedding vows, eight days before his death. The Royals congratulated Stuie, who has raised £, for the hospice by running km every day in May. He was inspired by Captain Sir Tom Moore, who raised £million for the NHS by walking  laps of his garden before his th birthday. Stuie said: “Fraser was my best friend. He was always a happy, bright child. We used to play in the garden with water, he loved it.” Workers at the hospice went “above and beyond” to support the Delfs. Teaching assistant Carla said: “Staff didn’t just care for him – they cooked and washed for us – ­allowing us to be Fraser’s parents full-time for the last time.” They even arranged for Carla and engineer Stuart, , to renew their vows in Fraser’s room. The couple married ten years ago but said Carla: “Fraser never understood why he was the only one not in our wedding photos. “I mentioned this in passing to a nurse, and within  hours they ­arranged a vicar to come and do a ­blessing, hair and makeup for me, a photographer, buffet and cake. “It was incredibly special and emotional. We wore clothes with stars on, ­because Fraser loved stars.”  Fraser was born at  weeks, weighing just lb oz, and spent his first three months in a special care unit. An MRI scan in  showed he had calcium on his brain. Carla and Stuart were told Fraser would eventually lose his mobility. Carla said: “It sounds awful now, but I was convinced I wouldn’t have Fraser past the age of ten.” On a flight back from Florida in April  he collapsed after a huge nosebleed. Medics ­stabilised him, but a week later he vomited blood and was rushed to hospital. He was diagnosed with esophageal ices, which causes veins near the stomach to enlarge and can lead to le-threatening ruptures. His liver disease was diagnosed as serious but he was too frail for a transplant. Blood tests in October  finally showed he had Coats plus syndrome, thought to have fewer than  ­confirmed cases ever. At astonishing odds, both Carla and Stuart were found to be ­carriers. Carla said: “It was awful – yet part of me was relieved to finally have ­answers.” His health declined faster than expected and by September his stomach became swollen and Fraser was in constant pain.  She said: “He could no longer attend his special needs school – when he was awake he screamed all the time. “Stuie was amazing, like another carer for him though it was a lot for him to take in. The consultant advised us to be honest about what was happening to later help him grieve. He may carry the condition, but can choose laterhe wants tests.” By November Fraser’s spleen was more than .in – double the normal size for his age – and his stomach shut down. Carla said: “The end had ­arrived sooner than we hoped.” He was admitted to Each and died peacefully after seven weeks on January . Carla said: “The hospice staff let us bathe him that night and painted his nails gold, which he had loved. We wore the star-covered outfits we wore for our vows to his funeral.” Grieving in lockdown is a “lonely struggle”, she said."},{"url":null,"title":"live coronavirus uk lockdown updates","story":"NewsCoronavirus UPDATES: PM to unveil project speed to fast track UK economy recoveryIn hospitals, England recorded a further  deaths from Covid-, Wales five and Northern Ireland had one new death - while there were no recorded hospital deaths in ScotlandShareByDanya BazaraaSenior News ReporterUpdated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video third-uk-beach-hit-police-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news live-coronavirus-uk-lockdown-updates-\"\" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-cdn-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news live-coronavirus-uk-lockdown-updates- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-cdn-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\"Boris Johnson is set to use the inspiration of the national coronavirus response to fast track major building projects across the country in an attempt to kickstart the UK economy.

These are the ones who can’t ever see why they should alter their ­behaviour for anything. There could be a warning that an escaped Tyrannosaurus Rex was in Wetherspoons, attracted by scampi and chips night, so we were all advised to stay in. And they would say: “But I meet my mate Terry every Tuesday in Wetherspoons, I’m not cancelling that, it’s the highlight of my week. Anyway,we all stay indoors the dinosaurs have won.” It was always tricky to convince these people to stick to lockdown rules. So, as the lockdown is softened, we need careful guidance on how to behave, to make sure the virus doesn’t spread again. Luckily Boris Johnson told us we would be fine as long as we used our “common sense”. Because “use your common sense” is the advice you give when you haven’t got a clue what to do. This is why you don’t go to a car mechanic who looks at oil pouring from your engine and says: “It might be about to explode, I have no idea. So I suggest you start driving about on July  and see what happens, just use your common sense. That’s your service, that will be £ plus VAT.” With medical advice it’s even worse. Very few remedies for disease come about by common sense. For example, Shark Liver Oil is a known substance for boosting the immune system. I wonderthat became known through scientic study or common sense. It’s possible that one day,  years ago, someone had a weak immune system. So they thought: “I know what I’ll try, I’ll sail to the Gulf of Mexico, capture a shark, rip its liver out and eat tiny chunks of it three times a day after meals. I mean, it’s just common sense isn’t it ”Andyou were going to deal with a pandemic by common sense, I wonderBoris Johnson’s is thebest sort."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle harry support facebook","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Harry support Facebook ad boycott over spread of hate speechThe \"Stop Hate for Profit\" campaign was started by several US civil rights groups after the death of George Floyd, to pressure the company to act on hate speech and misinformationShareCommentsByElizabeth CullordDanya BazaraaSenior News Reporter:,  JUN NewsMeghan Markle and Prince Harry are reportedly backing the campaign\", url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

ICU nurse Kate and husband Daniel were both hit by Covid- weeks before Ostara was born. Kate had battled breast cancer and conceived against the odds. She said: “I’ve got my miracle.”The babygro reveals tiny Ostara Bundy was born in lockdown – but that is only part of a scary and miraculous story behind her arrival. Mum Kate – an intensive care nurse – was stricken by coronavirus in the final two weeks of her pregnancy. She fell ill after her husband, a senior NHS matron, was first hit by Covid-. Then, just days old, Ostara developed symptoms of the deadly infection herself – leaving the couple petried. And the triple trauma came after Kate, , had overcome breast cancer following a four-year battle. She and husband Daniel Bundy, , had been overjoyed when they learned they were expecting their second child – then rocked by a rollercoaster of emotions triggered by the coronavirus. Daniel self-isolated first when he lost his sense of taste and smell. Then, two weeks before Kate’s due date, she developed a high-temperature, lost her taste and smell and started a persistent cough. A swab confirmed it was Covid- and the family went into isolation. Kate said: “It was really scary.  “We had no idea what the virus might do during pregnancy. “I know my symptoms were relatively mild but to go down with it so close to birth. We had worked so hard to get pregnant and there was this fear that the virus might turn serious and I might end up in hospital.” It was on May , just three days after ending isolation, that Kate gave birth at St Mary’s Maternity Unit in Poole, Dorset. Ostara weighed a healthy lb oz. But joy turned to fear when the newborn was rushed back into hospital with a rash and high temperature. Kate added: “I was so scared. Daniel wasn’t allowed in the ward and we didn’t know what was wrong with Ostara. We thought it may have been a delayed response to Covid or Kawasaki disease.  “Luckily, Ostara recovered and is now a happy and healthy baby. They tested her for Covid-, but it came back negative. “They say it was a virus but, luckily, not corona. We were in for  hours but they were the scariest of my le. We have our miracle baby, but we were racked with anxiety for two days.” Kate, of Charminster, Dorset, went on maternity leave just weeks before the pandemic broke, but Daniel worked on wards with seriously ill Covid patients at Poole Hospital.

Tricia Scoullar was surrounded by friends and family when she sadly died, with relatives saying she fought until her last breath to stay with them. Daughter Clare has paid tribute to her much-loved mum, reports the Liverpool Echo. Mum and nan Tricia was just  when she suffered a seizure which lead to the discovery and diagnosis of Glioblastoma Multorme- the most aggressive form of cancer that begins with the brain. Clare, of Woolton, began fund-raising alongside the rest of the family to try and gather money for experimental treatment. Since her mumaposs seizures and subsequent cancer diagnosis, Clare and the rest of the family devoted much of their time to looking after Tricia and trying to improve her quality of le. The tumours on Triciaaposs brain lead to her having some issues with her speech a bit like a stutter and becoming confused when speaking. But towards the end of her le, Tricia could only say yes or no. Clare, , and her family fund-raised for experimental treatment in Mexico to try and prolong her le, while improving the quality of her condition too. But Tricia died on June  leaving her entire family grappling with grief. Clare said: Itaposs just heartbreaking - people tell you to prepare for the worst but how can you prepare to lose your mum  We got the money for the treatment, we went to Germany - we were meant to be going to Mexico but she couldnapost do the flight. Itaposs  hours so it was too much for her so we went to Germany instead. Her blood marker was really high, you have a cancer blood marker that tells you how much cancer is in your body and hers was higher than a normal cancer patientaposs - it came down a bit when we were in Germany and we were going for walks and getting out and about, then we came home and were on  lockdown. We couldnapost do anything but we never gave up hope and she fought until her last breath.  Tricia battled her cancer for  months and was surrounded by close family, including Clareaposs brother Paul and their dad, Michael, when she died. Clare added: There was about seven or eight of us close family in the room when she died. She didnapost want to leave me and our Paul and our dad. By the end, she couldnapost talk or walk - she could only say yes or no and even then, she got them confused. Itaposs just heartbreaking, thereaposs not enough research into Glioblastoma - when you give donations to the likes of Marie Curie, Macmillon or Cancer Research, only % goes directly to brain cancer research so you need to donate directly to brain cancer. People donapost live  months with it but she lived  months, sheaposs done amazing. She didnapost want to go, she loved her grand-kids and she was very family orientated and that kept her going. But it felt like she was being eaten from the inside and she was trapped in her own body in the end. It was absolutely heartbreaking - I think Iaposm just on autopilot at the moment. Clare and her family are planning a funeral, though with a limited number of attendees to comply with government guidance, and have been making banners in Cadbury purple, which was Triciaaposs favourite colour. Clare said: The first day she had the seizure, my entire le changed and the whole family just tried everything. We had the charity night on the st of February and thataposs people who havenapost got anything and they still helped us. Or businesses and companies that donated prizes, it was just amazing. Clare and her mumaposs story touched many people, with strangers reaching out to contact the family to offer their support and condolences. Clare said: I put it on Facebook that she had passed and you should see the comments - I havenapost been able to read them all yet because itaposs so overwhelming but Iaposve gone through and liked them all because Iaposm not ignorant.

In a family update posted on YouTube the pregnant teenager is surprised by her family with an influx of gts for her baby. Millie announced her pregnancy just weeks before ‘supermum’ Sue, , welcomed baby Heidie. And the teen is actually holding her sister when the presents come into the family living room.

In the adorable video Millieaposs many younger siblings can be seen playing with the boxes and helping her to unpack her gts.

The Duchess of Cambridge gave each child sunflower seeds and encouraged them to plant their own so they could watch it grow. But George is aposa little grumpyapos about the fact Louis is winning, Kate revealed. Kate gave the insight into how her family have been keeping occupied during lockdown while she was helping to create a new garden for a childrenaposs hospice. The keen gardener joined families from East Angliaaposs Childrenaposs Hospicesto plant a garden at The Nook, one of Eachaposs purpose-built hospices near Norwich, on Thursday. Using plants bought during a visit last week to Fakenham Garden Centre near her Norfolk home of Anmer Hall, Kate worked alongside a volunteer gardener, staff and two families to help create a new horticultural design for a large patio area. Marking the end of Childrenaposs Hospice Week, Kate taught Star Pope-Saunders, , her brothers Hudson, eight, and six-year-old Sonny how to loosen the plants from their pots to replant them. As she planted sunflowers with the children, she revealed that Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis are having a sunflower-growing competition, with the youngest sibling currently in the lead. Kate, dressed in a summery floral dress, said: The children are really enjoying growing their sunflowers, Louisaposs is winning so George is a little grumpy about that! The sunflower has been adopted as the emblem of hospice care, a symbol of joy with the seeds representing patients and the surrounding petals as love, care and compassion.Due to the coronavirus pandemic, it was the Pope-Saunders familyaposs first time at The Nook with Sonny, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour shortly after his birthday in February.His mother Kelly Pope-Saunders, from Norwich, said after the royal visit: She said they are having a sunflower-growing competition and Louis is winning, much to Georgeaposs annoyance. It was so nice to see her - and in such a lovely dress too - getting stuck in.Kate earlier told the family: Iaposm always so blown away by families like yours, particularly having to go through all of this in lockdown. You show such resilience and bravery. Youaposre such an inspiration to us all. More people in the country should meet families like you, thereaposs a huge amount of change for you all to take on and you have coped fantastically. Kate also met Liam and Lisa Page, whose three-month-old son Connor was born with severe brain damage on March . The duchess said: Going through lockdown at the same time, when you canapost see your loved ones, you canapost share with people - there arenapost other families necessarily here that you can share your experience with.  Kate and the families worked with sensory plants such as lavender, bay and rosemary, and the garden also contains strawberry plants, herbs, geraniums and hydrangeas in a calming lilac colour scheme. Tracy Rennie, Eachaposs acting chief executive, said Kate wanted to create a patio garden and was given a brief to include plants with smells and bright colours. Ms Rennie added: She was absolutely prepared to get her hands dirty - she didnapost need the gardening gloves we offered her - and even plunged her hands into the earth with that massive engagement ring on. The duchess also re-potted a large sunflower that she donated to Each in memory of nine-year-old Fraser Delf, who died in January this year at the Milton hospice in Cambridge.  Kate and the Duchess of Cornwall recently spoke to Fraseraposs family on a video call. In a message about Childrenaposs Hospice Week, Kate said: This Childrenaposs Hospice Week, Iaposd like to thank the amazing staff for all the work that you do in childrenaposs hospices around the UK. The care and the nurture that you provide children and families in the most unimaginable circumstances is just awe inspiring.

Met Police said at .pm that they had attended the aposunlicensed music eventapos and were dispersing those in attendance.The pandemic has seen most Pride events for this year cancelled but that didnapost stop people meeting up in London one week before pubs in England officially reopen. One of the largest Pride events is usually in the capital, which attracts hundreds of thousands of people each year, but the  event due to take place on Saturday was postponed due to Covid-. June  marks the official th anniversary of LGBTQ+ traditions and today a Black Trans Lives Matter march was held through London. Tribune magazine columnist Jason Okundaye tweeted: The black trans lives matter marches across london today are far closer to the original inception of pride, than the rainbow capitalism and barclays floats we’ve come to know will ever be. Pride isn’t cancelled this year, it’s back. The decision for so many people to gather at Clapham given the ongoing public health crisis has been criticized by some. George Scott took a picture of the crowds and wrote: Happy pride everybody. That’s a very big bubble on Clapham Common. Niall James said: If you’re on Clapham Common right now take a good hard long look at yourself!. And another Twitter user said: Pride in London wasn’t cancelled after all! They just moved it to Clapham Common instead... Big Brother contestant Mark Byron tweeted yesterday: Super excited for unnoficialpride tomorrow on Clapham Common!!!. Current social distancing guidelines are still that people from separate households should not come within two metres of each other - it does not officially change to aposone metre plusapos until July , when pubs have been given the green light to reopen.In the Black Trans Live Matter demonstration a crowd gathered at Hyde Park Corner before a march, with many wearing face coverings and carrying placards displaying messages such as Silence is violence, Protect trans youth and No justice, no peace. Some of the demonstrators also carried fresh flowers, while banners said Fight police brutality, fight racism! Fight imperialism! and Black trans lives matter. Human rights activist Peter Tatchell and former Gay Liberation Frontmembers also marched in central London.  The activists, some of whom are in their s and s, marched the route usually taken by the Pride In London parade calling for political action including the end of deportations for LGBT asylum seekers. Mr Tatchell, , told the PA news agency: Todayaposs march is a celebration of the th anniversary of the Gay Liberation Front. We are seeking to reclaim Pride as an event for LGBT+ human rights.  Mr Tatchell added: We hope that our protest will encourage people to remember the long, dficult struggle for LGBT+ rights and remember that here in Britain, and around the world, there are still battles to fight and win. He said that due to Covid- and underlying health conditions that just around a dozen GLF veterans would be joining the march. Mr Tatchell added: As well as campaigning for LGBT+ rights, we are expressing our solidarity with Black Lives Matter, and black LGBT+ people. Many members of the LGBT community have opted to hold online celebrations throughout Pride month.

We launched our Save Kids From Violent Parents campaign last year after revealing  children had been killed by their own s in  years. Current rules presume contact with both parents is in the best interests of a child. But our nine-month probe found scores of children suffered at the hands of parents known to be abusive. In some cases, unsupervised contact had been ordered by family courts. We also told how judges allow children to live with violent criminals including killers and paedos. Now a Ministry of Justice report has said: “We recommend that the presumption of parental involvement be reviewed urgently in order to address its detrimental effects.” Changes could be via the upcoming Domestic Abuse Bill or by amending current laws. The Mirror wants those with a history of violence, abuse or sex crimes to be presumed unsafe for unsupervised access. Jess Phillips, shadow minister for safeguarding and domestic violence, said: “The presumption makes children and mothers unsafe and undoes safeguarding standards.”  We told how a teenager was allowed to live with her dad, despite him being on licence for manslaughter. He was later jailed for grabbing the girl by the throat in a drunken rage.

After going through gruelling cancer treatment, she had just a  per cent chance of conceiving – but conceive she did. Then husband Daniel caught Covid-, and in the final two weeks of pregnancy Kate fell ill with the virus too. Two weeks after their baby was born, the little mite also succumbed. Today we are delighted to report that mum, dad and baby Ostara are fully recovered. We are also pleased to offer a glimmer of hope that the disease might be weakening. Scientists want to find out why, when a care home in Northants was infected,  patients and staff only suffered mild symptoms. There is some evidence from Italy that the virus is getting less strong there too. But that doesn’t mean we should be complacent and drop our guard. The big test will come next Saturday when pubs, restaurants, hotels, hairdressers, campsites, caravan parks and cinemas reopen. Le will be better but far from normal. There will be restrictions. Social distancing must be maintained. You will be able to go to places of worship – but not to sing in them.

The boneheads who crammed beaches last week or careered into each other at illegal raves show how easy it is to, well, lose our heads. At last we will be able to enjoy the company of friends and family again. But only by obeying the rules. Otherwise we will face a second wave, which could be worse than the first, and be in lockdown all over again. We can defeat this disease together. But only by staying apart.

Louise Coats sued producers behind The Amazing World of Gumball – where she was a script editor – after accusing one of making a sexual comment to her. She claimed they sacked her when she raised harassment issues, and stole the credit for her work. But after a two-year legal battle, an employment tribunal ruled Ms Coats’ claims were without merit. It decided she must pay £, towards the costs of programme maker Great Marlborough Productions – who had originally demanded £,. Tribunal judges accused her of making “absurd” claims that bosses were continuing to harass and victimise her and producing “flimsy evidence”. They blasted her for wasting time and public money by prolonging a losing battle against the Cartoon Network.

He put men in skirts and women in bomber jackets. Models were presented as both sensual and tough.Aarticle published in  said that Ray#s vision coincided with the very beginning of what has subsequently become the commercialisation and mass consumption of street style.He, quite notably, brought the MA flight jacket into the public consciousness by pairing it with loose-fitting Levi#s jeans. Add a porkpie hat and a pair of brogues and you#ve got Petri#s signature personal look.The most influential # and probably most successful # fashion image creator of the #s, his work celebrated culture and inspired people to forge their own identity.In an interview with the New York Times, French photographer Jean-Baptiste Mondino, who collaborated with Petri on multiple projects, recalled his love of classic Italian tailoring #done in a Caribbean way#.#Ray was obsessed with extra-long shirt sleeves, so he would cut them off at the shoulder and reattach them with big safety pins so that they stuck out under suit jackets,” Mondino said.One of the most recognised images associated with the Buffalo collective featured on the cover of the March  issue of The Face. Taken by Jamie Morgan, the photograph captures a scowling -year-old boy wearing men#s clothes, with the word #killer# emblazoned on his hat.The provocative photograph was shot on mm black and white film and is seen as a rejection of the female-focused, soft and colourful photography that was happening in fashion magazines at that time.For Barry Kamen, the image was about #taking gentleman’s hats and dferent sartorial influences and putting a Jamaican spin on it, then dressing these things on a young, -year-old Jewish boy#.He said: #It was giving it a dferent spin, and then putting the headline on it, like the front page of a newspaper.#In , Petri developed what looked like a stye on his eye. This turned out to be Kaposi#s sarcoma # an AIDS-related tumour involving the skin and other organs # which would eventually spread all over his face and body.Despite his illness he continued to work, although a lack of knowledge and understanding surrounding the disease meant that many did not know how to react to him.Jean Paul Gaultier, who held a front-row seat for Petri until his death aged  in , said: “I was actually criticised for that by people working in the business, which made me very upset.“I felt that it was extremely courageous of Ray to expose himself. It was a show of strength, which I admired and had to support. But others refused to see the truth.”Petri didn#t live long enough to enjoy financial or mainstream success from his work, but his legacy lives on.From Helmut Lang and David Beckham # who once channelled Petri#s vision by wearing a patterned sarong over a pair of trousers during the  World Cup in France # to the thousands of millennials whose urban style is based on a mix of sportswear and fashion, he was a man who left an indelible mark on the world.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited. The charity has created a free pack full of tips, ideas and videos to help people host their own virtual picnic.You can hold your picnic in your garden, on your balcony or on the living room floor. Just find some space, make some tasty treats and connect with friends and family online.Although we are all still respecting social distancing and cannot meet in groups, we can still share experiences together and create happy memories.  And when lockdown finally ends we can do it all again, but this time in person.To find out more and to get your free pack, visit the Family Action website.David Holmes CBE, Family Action Chief Executive Officer, London"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll golf clubs tee off as lockdown eases","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf clubs across the region are planning to re-open on a limited basis on Friday May , following the latest Scottish Government guidance.Lochgilphead Golf Club#s course will be open to members only in the first instance and members must pre-book tee times in line with Scottish Golf guidelines.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

infected person will pass the virus to on average.Coronavirus has an estimated reproduction number of three, meaning an infected person will likely pass the virus on to at least three other people.A

single dose, astudy in pigs has revealed.The ChAdOx nCoV-vaccine -developed by the University of Oxford - is currently undergoing human trials and it is hoped an effective vaccine could be ready later this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for SARS-CoV-."},{"url":null,"title":"staycation-five-scotlands-photogenic-places-visit-lockdown-eases","story":"WITH lockdown measures slowly beginning to ease and the coronavirus continuing to be

Theyrsquore because of public reaction and public perception of Tourettersquos.ldquoThe fact that Irsquom ticking doesnrsquot make me depressed and it doesnrsquot make me anxious.\"Itrsquos how other people react. Itrsquos only such a huge part of my le because of other people.ldquoItrsquos instinctive for people to turn around and look, but it doesnrsquot take away from the fact that it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed over something that I cannot control.It was not only the tics that made Jack stand out from the crowd during childhood.As a gay teenager, he says he struggled to make any male friends because of his sexuality, which he has never hidden.And the struggles, although manesting in dferent forms, have continued into young adult le.As a result of years of relentless twitching and involuntary leg movements, Jack is battling chronic muscle pain and nausea.Cognitive behaviour therapy reiki reflexology ndash Jack has tried everything to relieve the pain but to little avail.He is prescribed strong painkillers, and at times has had to keep his neck in a brace because of his tics.,params: .pushWhen attempting to enter bars or nightclubs, bouncers sometimes reject him because they believe he is under the influence of illegal drugs.Alcohol consumption can trigger his tics, making them more prominent and frequent.Even in university lectures, he sometimes must call out people for continually turning around and staring at him, despite knowing his condition.Jack insists that suffering from Tourette syndrome has given him a ldquothick skin\".He has always felt fully supported by his parents but has chosen to be independent from a young age, refusing to let his condition prevent him from doing the things he wants to achieve.Attending doctors appointments on his own from the age of , Jack preferred to handle everything by himself.In his third year at Peebles High School, Jack ran a public campaign and was successfully elected as a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor the region.He said: ldquoI ran because Irsquove always been interested in social issues and wanted to meet like-minded people, which I sometimes felt starved of growing up.ldquoI think I would be a really confident, extroverted guy without my tics ndash they are the one thing holding me back.Since his darkest days battling anxiety and depression, Jack has made friends andhad part-time jobs in bars in Peebles and Edinburgh.Mental health struggles may have stolen parts of Jacks childhood ndash and he continues to live in the spotlight of Tourettersquos ndash but it hasnrsquot stopped him embracing student le."},{"url":null,"title":"bournemouth-major-incident-thousands-pack-beaches-south-coast","story":"A MAJORincident has been declared after thousands of people flocked to the beach in southern England.The sun-seekers - defying official advice -descended onBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council beaches on the hottest day of the year so far.A multi-agency emergency response has now been activated to co-ordinate resources across the area.Council leader Vikki Slade said: ldquoWe are absolutely appalled at the scenes witnessed on our beaches, particularly at Bournemouth and Sandbanks, in the last - hours.\"The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe.\"We have had no choice now but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.Services were left completely overstretched as visitors arrived in large volumes resulting in widespread problems of illegal parking, excessive waste, anti-social behaviour, gridlock on roads and prohibited overnight camping.BCP Council issued  parking enforcement fines ndash the highest on record ndash and responded to many reports of cars parking and causing an obstruction.Roads in and out of the area were heavily congested into the early hours.Crews received widespread abuse and intimidation as they attempted to empty overflowing bins on the seafront.

Greece and Germany.According to reports, air bridges will be announced in batches, with the second set of destinations likely to include other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Finland and Holland and ldquolow-risk Caribbean islands.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said air bridges would only be agreed with countries which have a coronavirus test and trace system of the same standard as that used in Britain.When will air bridges be introduced The first air bridges to low-risk countries could be in force from July , but Mr Shapps said no announcement will be made until June  when the quarantine measures will be officially reviewed.Which countries are unlikely to be included There were mixed reports over whether Portugal would be included in the UKrsquos plans next week after a spike in coronavirus cases in the country.Long-haul flights to destinations such as Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong are reportedly not expected before late summer.Flights to Australia are thought to be

bar a handful of exemptions ndash have been required to go into self-isolation for  days when they arrive in the UK.People who fail to comply can be fined pound, in England, and police are allowed to use ldquoreasonable force to make sure they follow the rules.What measures have airports taken Last month, Heathrow Airport began trialling thermal screening technology to detect elevated temperatures

The risks include it preventing the ability to breathe and, in extreme cases, death.It can cause the heart rate to beat irregularly, increasing the risk of heart failure, and heavy use has been linked to vitamin B deficiency which can cause nerve damage. The user can also become confused and panicky, which may lead to accidents.This is not something we want our children and young people experimenting with. This is a gas that dentists and medical professionals use under controlled conditions to sedate patients for minor medical procedures.I have arranged a multi-agency meeting to raise awareness of the risks and to prevent someone from becoming ill, injured or dying from this.Please talk to your children and discuss the dangers of these canisters and the impact of ASB.Eventhey havenrsquot been part of the group, they may know who has. Please report any concerns to us on the  number, or  in an emergency.If we all work together we can improve our communities and keep our children and young people safe."},{"url":null,"title":"lights-camera-action-aspiring-filmmakers","story":"Dunbar-based Battery Theatre is creating a special project based around East Lothianrsquos Second World War

In the first, and arguably the strongest tale, In a Deer Stand, a man lies in the middle of nowhere with a broken ankle and no means of contacting anyone. Tired of constantly losing battles and desperate for ldquothe feeling of winning, he decided a day or two ago to drive far away from his family. As he lies immobile, mulling over all he has left behind, he watches a rising mist and braces himself for another cold, damp night outdoors. ldquoSooner or later, somebody will show up, he muses, but it is hard to share his optimism.Other characters in other stories flounder overseas or in unfamiliar environments. Lina in By Sydvest Station has not so much lost her bearings as her moral compass. Still smarting from a stinging rebuke and a recent break-up, she overcomes her loss by pretending to work for a cancer charity and collecting donations from unsuspecting members of the public. Or as she puts it: ldquoRinging on strange peoplersquos doorbells to demand love and respect. However, when she rings Elsarsquos doorbell she gets more than she bargained for.Later, in Manitoba, Nors demonstrates her unique power to disturb with the vaguest of details. An ex-teacher who ldquoresembles a normal man and who ldquono longer has any wish to regulate his abnormalities watches scouts pitch their tents in the field opposite his house ndash and then recalls a former pupil. The past also overlaps the present in the evocative, contemplative title story. Here, a womanrsquos nostalgic childhood memories of idyllic wild swimming lure her back in the water, but in a public swimming pool she quickly feels out of her depth.Norsrsquo last collection of stories, Karate Chop, mostly revolved around female characters ndash mothers, daughters, wives and girlfriends on the brink of breaking down or cracking up. In contrast, Wild Swims focuses on the travails of both men and women. When they appear together, Nors blends in madcap antics and black humour. In Hygge, an elderly man joins a ldquosenior club to play chess, only to learn that the ageing female members have dferent plans for him: ldquoas a bachelor I had to place my body at the disposal of all the cast-off women and their expectations.These truly are short stories. No tale exceeds seven pages. Some amount to mere sketches, snapshots or portraits. Many are fuelled by strange thoughts and idiosyncratic deeds. A few are maddeningly evasive and raise more questions than answers. And yet all are masterclasses in concision and most get straight to the nub of the matter, able to perfectly convey a mood, encapsulate an emotion or dramatise a predicament. Nors has described her stories as ldquohit-and-run-literature, which aptly sums them up: she gets in there, does her thing, then gets out, often leaving us marvelling at her dexterity.We also admire Norsrsquo prose, which is rich with quirky formulations and novel comparisons .Sharp, inventive, and consistently captivating, Norsrsquo tales are miniature wonders.

Would it be a jargon- filled account blunted by impenetrable scientic research and endless demographic statistics, I wondered  Alternatively, it could turn out to be some idealistic paean by a writer simply rapt by the vast spectacle of people on the move. Any misgivings, however, were quickly dispelled, for this is a book that captivates and educates on so many levels.Part travel journal, part reportage, part investigative journalism, itrsquos a work impeccably researched but heartfelt and driven by eloquent descriptive storytelling. These myriad components all serve to make the bookrsquos core argument that migration, far from being a problem, is in fact the solution to the crises that confront so many species today, not least humankind.For the author, an American investigative journalist, ldquomigration is a force of nature, rooted in human biology and history, along with that of the scores of other wild species with whom we share this changing planet. In explaining it this away, Shah takes the reader on a fascinating kaleidoscopic historical and geographical journey. From the southern Calornian habitat of the checkerspot butterfly to the high Himalaya and its shting forests, to the teeming refugee and migrant camps on the Greek island of Lesbos, the eyewitness accounts and interviews from these locations are the work of an accomplished journalist.This ersity and juxtaposition of insights into many aspects of migration are, however, both the bookrsquos greatest strengths and occasionally a weakness. I say weakness only because of the odd moment of uncomfortable jarring in certain comparisons between human migration and that of other species. Can there really be parallels between the infinitesimal territorial relocation of the checkerspot butterfly and, say, Syrian refugees  But then again both are stories of adaptability and the necessity of mobility as a means of surviving in threatening environments.Over the course of the bookrsquos  chapters and conclusion, some readers might at times find this scattergun sweep that draws from the natural, scientic and geopolitical realm slightly disorientating. Some nitpickers might argue, too, that it occasionally takes the reader too far off course in terms of the bookrsquos main thesis.But such shortcomings are minor irritations and more than compensated for by the way Shah convincingly pulls these disparate ends together to reveal how migration and movement are as much a necessity to existence as breathing.In this respect there are echoes here of the great travel writer Bruce Chatwinrsquos wonderful homage to nomadism and wanderlust The Songlines.But Shahrsquos account, while acknowledging the near ldquospiritual need for humans to be on the move and the positive role this plays in our collective culture and psyche, also concerns itself with the arguably much more pressing issue of biological need and physical survival. It was Chatwin himself, after all, who admitted that for many ldquoa journey is a fragment of hell. Those caught in the ravages of climate change, war and poverty already know this from bitter experience. As one of the many revealing indicators in the book points out ldquoby  the spread of deserts in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to compel  million inhabitants to pick up and leave. By  rising sea levels could add another  million to their ranks.Faced with such an onslaught itrsquos no surprise that almost daily our news reports highlight the growth in migration. And, just as they do so, politicians - especially those of a populist or rightest bent - use the perceived threat of migration to kindle fear and appeal to voters with policies that ultimately consolidate their own power.Here Shah does a tremendous service to our understanding of the malign manipulation of the supposed ldquomigrant threat. She traces this perception of it, something sinister and to fear back, back to the th century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, generally considered to the originator of modern taxonomy, which is the practice and science of classying things or concepts.Linnaeus was ldquoentranced by order, effectively reinforcing the idea of putting things in their place, including people. For Linnaeus there was no such thing as a shared ancestry and over time such theories helped shape many of todayrsquos more toxic narratives about immigration.ldquoThe paths taken by human migrants are shaped primarily by abstractions, explains Shah. ldquoDistant political leaders lay down rules based on political and economic concerns, allowing some in and keeping others out. They draw and redraw invisible lines on the landscape in biologically arbitrary ways.She writes, too, of how some observers have seen the writing on the wall for some time, citing the US national security expert Robert D. Kaplan, who described it in a  Atlantic magazine article headlined ldquoThe Coming Anarchy.That the next great migration of plants, animals and humans is already upon us is indisputable. As this timely book outlines, scientists have found that of the four thousand species that they have tracked, between  and  per cent had altered their distribution over the past handful of decades, around  per cent into cooler lands and waters in sync with the changing climate.Human relocation is no less dramatic, with more people living outside their countries of birth today than at any time before. Floods, storms, poverty, persecution and war have all been triggers.Previous books by Shah including Pandemic: Tracking Contagions from Cholera to Ebola and Beyond, have been prescient to say the least. This study is no less so. Totally fascinating, and extremely well written, this is a book of our times and one all of us should take the time to read. When Covid- and lockdown recedes I willto that Andalusian coastline with its migratory birds and people on the move crossing between continents.

However speedily some plug plants or seedlings grow, donrsquot expect miracles by winter. Down south, longer autumn daylight hours may give you a crop of sprouts for Christmas from July plantings but forget it in this country, whatever catalogues may tell you.It is also too late for hearting cabbages, caulis, neeps or broccoli are out of the question. Large rooted carrots or parsnips are now the stuff of dreams.Virtually everything I recommend here can be direct sown at some point over the next few weeks.Between mail order firms and the newly opened garden centres, pricier plug plants are a simpler alternative to seeds.Remember to add compost or other organic fertiliser to refresh the ground after the previous crop.Yoursquoll get excellent results with quick-growing leaf crops. I canrsquot fault Buttercrunch and Little Gem lettuce. And, to avoid bolting, slower growers such as ene En Cornet de Bordeaux and chicories Palla Rossa and Treviso are best sown now.As an added bonus, these later sowings develop a striking red colour during the cooler autumn, so you could always fill any gaps at the front of flower beds as well.And while on flower beds, why not try some wonderfully decorative kales Like the lettuce and ene brigade, you can also graze some fresh leaves. The plants will no longer develop fully, but will offer a delicious nibble. I canrsquot recommend Emerald Ice kale strongly enough. Beautully frilled white and green leaves with a crisp nutty taste when picked young. You donrsquot even need to cook them.Other attractive kales include Red Russian with suitably coloured serrated leaves. The smaller Nero di Toscana iety boast a burgeoning crown of plumply erect foliage.If like me, you enjoy the tangy, irony flavour of spinach, a sowing of Swiss chard or perpetual spinach, like Erbette, will start producing a small crop by autumn. Although perpetual spinach is too tender to survive the winter, chard should do so.Grow in a sheltered spot or protect with fleece during a harsh spell and yoursquoll get a spring flush.Several quick-growing root crops are the perfect way to fill small corners. Radishes need hardly any space. Theyrsquore less fiery when grown in partial shade and watered well. Along with traditional speedy growers, try winter radishes China Rose and Black Spanish Long.They can be sown next month for an autumn harvest, or lted and stored for slicing or grating in a winter salad.And I wouldnrsquot be without white turnips, these little autumn gems. Sow Milan Purple Top or Snowball next month or in August.You need to keep an eye on them as they grow pretty fast and I wouldnrsquot want one bigger than a tennis ball. Direct sow or in modules.Irsquom not a beetroot fan, but ieties like Pablo or Bona are still possible.

Although they acknowledge the disastrous impact shunning them could have on the livelihoods of those who work in hospitality, they put their health first.Some of these people have already decided that they wonrsquot feel safe enough to dine out for the rest of .Age isnrsquot necessarily the defining factor in this decision ndash % of those aged over  want to get back out to restaurants, according to a survey of , members of Tastecard, the UKrsquos largest dining club.It also found that % of people plan to continue dining out as frequently as before, while % even plan to dine out more.Looking specically at Scotland, over , restaurant-goers were surveyed earlier this month by pm, Glasgowrsquos booking-based website, and simpleERB, the restaurant booking management system.When asked, ldquoHow often did you visit a restaurant in the  months prior to lockdown  % said ldquoSeveral times and % said ldquoSeveral times a week. And when asked, ldquoHow likely are you to visit a restaurant when they re-open , % said ldquoExtremely likely and % ldquoVery likely. Only % said ldquoNot very likely or ldquoNot at all likely.So, the appetite of enthusiastic restaurant-goers, the regular clientele that has kept many restaurants going in the past, has not signicantly waned. This confirms my personal observation that many people who feel that they ought not visit restaurants were never big eaters out to start with, before coronavirus.So, for those of us counting the days until we can have a nice brunch, lunch, or dinner out again, what matters  We definitely want to see hand sanitising stations .Irsquod add here, that restaurants might consider a simple soap and hand basin point near the entry, as is common in India. Partitions between customers were welcomed by %. With some thoughtful design, such screens could feel little dferent from the perennially popular booth-style dining, which gives a sense of intimacy. Though Irsquom not sure the sort of plexiglass bubbles seen in our photograph would be welcomed by everyone.And donrsquot forget that even sidestepping the thorny issue of whether the measure for physical distancing should be two or one metres, you can take for granted that most restaurants in Scotland will be quiet at lunchtime. So having plenty space at lunch at least need not be a concern.And % of respondents favoured temperature checks for staff. This is easy to do and a good idea anyway.I have complained loudly in the past about being served by people with stinking colds who have probably struggled into work because the management would dock their pay otherwise. That narrow-sighted practice is long overdue for a change. Temperature checks of customers and face masks, on the other hand, were favoured by just under half of respondents.They werenrsquot so concerned about staff wearing gloves , or face shields . A recognition, it seems, that post-Covid, we donrsquot want our restaurant outings to be as sterile as a visit to the dentist.Hearteningly, the survey picked up a willingness amongst customers to help restaurateurs operate as profitably as possible in these dficult circumstances ndash % of those polled said they ldquodefinitely or ldquoprobably would pre-order their food, and % were prepared to limit their time at the table to let restaurateurs take more customers throughout the day.You see, we cherish our restaurants, and want to see them bounce back."},{"url":null,"title":"recipe-gary-townsends-curried-cauliflower","story":"Makes  +Ingredients: x large caullowerTahiniSesame seedsCurry powderVegetable oilSaltKnob of butterMethod:Pre-heat oven to c gas mark .Prepare your caullower into florets, cut these in half so you have a flat side.Cover the flat side with a small amount of olive oil and then curry powder.

Not today. The mask might have lain there for weeks, but it felt better to leave it for someone with rubber gloves to deal with. In the coming months, I suspect paper masks will become the new crisp packet or plastic water bottle, the leading litter offender of our times. Artists are doubtless already photographing bandit-style objects dangling from trees or trapped in drains, compiling a photo-montage of Covid detritus, to look back on in years to come.Now that face coverings are obligatory on public transport, and recommended in smaller shops and confined spaces, the day is coming when most of us will carry some form of protective gear in our pocket. This is meant to make us, and others, safer, yet the sight of bus passengers earlier this week, hidden from chin to eye, was anything but reassuring. It reminded me of cattle trucks, where all you can see between the slats are the animalsrsquo eyes, rolling in fear as they head for the abattoir.Some of my friends have been covering up for months others would rather head for the hills and ride out the storm like outlaws than comply. But like it or not, I suspect this latest accessory will be with us for the foreseeable future. The days when we used to stare in bemusement at Oriental tourists wearing what looked like BQ dust protectors are long gone. In some places, especially cities, it seems face coverings are already de rigueur, so much so that fashion houses are producing their own lines, to complement their designer range. This could either be seen as a definition of sad, or defiantly le-affirming.How did it come to this  In a text exchange with a friend, we were comparing styles, and recommending ones we liked, when a shudder went through both of us. Who ever thought we would be having this dialogue  It was a sobering moment, stark proof of how altered the world has become in a matter of months.The fabric visors I have on order are as non-medical as it gets, short of the Venice carnival. If Laura Ashley were still in business, I could have lurked unnoticed among the rails in one of these for days. Perhaps wisely, my husband has opted instead for the Ned Kelly look. With a hill-walking snood pulled up over his nose he looks dastardly, and warm. With the hottest days of the year approaching, wearers will be severely tested. It is no joke. On overheated buses, tubes and trains ndash often tropical even in winter ndash being cocooned behind cloth, wool or paper will raise temperatures to simmering point. Tempers might follow. This is no time, certainly, for the menopausal. It will be interesting to see what happensanyone finds it so unbearable a prospect that they dare to go bare-faced.So far the enforcement of lockdown measures has been largely consensual, the police working amicably to ensure peoplersquos safety. Butany passengers revolt or feel unwell when under wraps, who will handle that situation  Itrsquos simple enough to prevent refusniks getting on at the bus stop, but thereafter the driver cannot be expected to enforce the law. Will there be a member of transport police on every service or at every station, or a rapid response squad within hailing distance What about those who suffer from asthma or other respiratory complaints that mean they cannot trap their noses and mouths  Confronting public anger or filthy stares as they appear to flout the rules will be bad enough but how do they convince officials that their condition is genuine  The mere prospect of having to prove their credentials, or to run a gauntlet of jibes and stares, will deter many from even attempting to hop on public transport.Of course we will eventually get used to swaddling ourselves, just as wersquore now programmed to reach for soap after every foray beyond the front door, and to keep a cowrsquos distance from neighbours. Yet the potential hazards of facial wraps are fiercely debated. The main concern is that people will feel a  sense of security behind their personal protective barrier and neglect to wash their hands. Nor, Irsquove read, is cloth very effective at preventing the passage of small contagious droplets. When you add to this the likelihood that the discomfort of prolonged use leads to constant tweaking and touching, it seems their health benefits might be less assured than wersquove been encouraged to believe.All of this suggests the psychological signicance might be as important as the medical purpose. Seeing a sea of veiled faces around you reinforces the message of pervasive threat. Visors, in whatever shape, are a visible reminder that each and every one of us presents a potential risk to others. They are symbols of our collective duty to be seen to be taking precautions by wearing them, we signal willingness to help lower anxiety and alarm, and to play our part in the communal effort to defeat this disease.Will we ever feel relaxed under these circumstances  I can cope with the prospect of covering up while heading off on holiday but once at my destination, how easygoing will a cafe or gallery, beach or bar feel when you can only see waitersrsquo and bartendersrsquo eyes, and art lovers or bookshop browsers look like the cast in Holby City  Holidays are about escaping the everyday, and switching off. Learning to do that now will require mentally airbrushing out the red flags in the scene before us, be it perspex screens, the distance between tables, or a proleration of nosebags.

The First Minister insists she is putting safety first.Scotland will not be following the ldquoreckless relaxation of lockdown pursued by heartless English Tories, who are only interested in the bottom line. Such at least is the political message the Scottish government hopes to convey.In reality, itrsquos not entirely clear what is happening in Scotland about social distancing. Jason Leitch, the National Clinical Director, told BBC Radio yesterday that he expected the two metre rule to be relaxed very soon.:Scotlands two-metre social distancing rule will change, according to Jason LeitchAnd John Swinney later announced that he is aiming for schools to go back to full time teaching on th August, which also suggests lockdown is not long for this world. The Labour MSP Iain Gray called this the ldquomother and father of ministerial climb-downs.Only last week Mr Swinney had been talking about a year of ldquoblended learning and no exams. This was under his assumption that the two metre rule would be still be adhered to over the summer and into the next school year.His u-turn may also be a broad wink to the hospitality industry that Scotland will be following England in the not too distant future. They should plan for a one metre rule and not give up the ghost.Letrsquos hope they get the message, because only % of pubs and % of restaurants say they can survive with two metre social distancing, according to the Scottish Tourism Alliance.Ms Sturgeon says she is no longer bothered about the R number ndash the infection rate that she said last month was her guiding policy. The number of infections is now so small that R is largely meaningless.So,the disease is disappearing fast, and the infection rate is irrelevant, why is Scotland sticking with the two-metre rule at all  Are we following the science or not Nicola Sturgeon suggested yesterday that the scientic advice from SAGE may not entirely concur with Boris Johnsonrsquos decision yesterday to liberate the nation from its Covid ldquohibernation.The former government Chief Scientic Adviser, Sir David King, chair of the ldquoindependent SAGE group, is pretty sure that the official SAGE scientists are not on side. He says it is ldquofar too soon to ease the two-metre rule and that this will increase infections and lead to more deaths.However, the science isnrsquot exactly rock solid on two metres. The World Health Organisation, which government critics often claim is a better advice-giver than SAGE, suggests a one metre rule is safe. WHO says that the risk of catching the disease falls by % over that distance.China, Denmark and more importantly our nearest neighbour France are also in the one metre camp.There is evidence that risk falls by at least a further %you are standing two metres distant. But the risk of transmission depends on many factors: distance is only a part of it. Wearing masks, for example, almost certainly makes one metre equivalent to two. Outdoors, there seems little dference between one and two metres, and even indoors itrsquos no guarantee of immunity.A study cited by the BBC from the Chinese city of Guangzhou, looked at a cluster of infections in a restaurant which was using the one metre rule. Half of the people who came down with the disease were discovered to have been sitting more than two metres away from the primary source of the infection.:Sturgeon prepares to accelerate Scotlands exit from lockdown - but two-metre rule stays for nowAir flow and ventilation seem to be a big factor. Bad ventilation can super spread this virus. On the other hand, sophisticated air conditioning, such as on aircraft with HEPA filters, might actually suppress Covid , especiallypassengers are wearing masks.Theof time you are in contact with a person with Covid- also seems to be a major factor. Just donrsquot hang around, is the message. Indeed, wersquore told thatyou want to hold a conversation with someone you should really stand back to back. Which would be most interesting at a conference or reception ndash assuming we ever have them again.Professor Linda Bauld, of Public Health at Edinburgh University says politicians should ldquonot to get too hung up about distance. There is just too much going on to make this into an inviolable rule ndash like the R number which politicians obsessed about until recently.This at any rate is the view of the UK government. Boris Johnson believes that the costs of relaxing the two-metre rule are far outweighed by the likely costs of not relaxing it. This isnrsquot just a financial calculus ndash putting profits before health.Not allowing the schools toto anything resembling normality is likely to have a signicant impact on the long term health and wellbeing of young people. Similarly, not opening bars, restaurants and leisure activities means depriving many more young people of jobs and security ndash major factors in mental health.It is simply not possible to conduct anything resembling normal le with a two metre rule. Public transport becomes unmanageable, tourism is undermined, shops and offices stay closed. We are a gregarious species and trying to keep two metres away from our fellow man and woman is extraordinarily dficult.Children are not observing anything like a two metre rule in parks and gardens, as is only too obvious. It seems absurd therefore that they should be prevented from attending well managed and clean schools where the risk will be very much less.:CMO warnshealthboards not to assume Covid antibodies provide immunityMany parents were outraged at Mr Swinneyrsquos ldquoblended learning plans, with some pupils getting as little as a day of teaching per week. They made their feelings very plain to the Deputy First Minister and he appears to have got the message.Mr Swinney is now sounding more bullish than Boris Johnson about reopening the schools full time from August th.

Available June Two women, a dying wish and a web of lies - Karen Hamilton is back with her latest twisted thriller.

Fans of The Perfect Girlfriend will love Hamiltons latest, and the Last We is an utterly compelling, addictive read. Marie makes the ultimate unreliable narrator, and Hamilton is a skilled writer who makes you invest in the most unlikeable of characters. It is the kind of book you finish in one sitting, with enough twists to keep you guessing until the final page.. The Half Sister by Sandie Jones is published in paperback by Pan, priced pound. . Available June A knock at the door during a normal Sunday lunch changes everything for sisters Kate and Lauren. On the other side of the door is their half sister, Jess, looking for answers about the family she never knew. Told through dual narratives, this book is a compelling read and has a lot of potential. However, it is let down by the slow pacing during the first half, which sees the story get bogged down in a lot of unnecessary details and sub-plots that dont add much to the main narrative. Things pick up in the second half, as it races towards the somewhat inevitable conclusion. The end comes too soon, and there has not been enough back story to make it feel believable or satisfying. The Half Sister is a domestic suspense thriller, but perhaps could be better described as a light family drama, as it lacks the heart-racing hook of a thriller.Non-fiction. The Art of Political Storytelling by Philip Seargeant is published in hardback by Bloomsbury Academic, priced pound. . Available nowSubtitled Why Stories Win Votes in Post-Truth Politics, this book by a language and communicate expert tries to explain one of the great quandaries of our age: why reason and logic fail to win out over emotion and truthiness in political discourse. The answer, argues Seargeant, is stories. Successful recent political initiatives, such as the election of Donald Trump and the winning Brexit vote, packaged their causes as powerfully simple but highly adaptable narratives that plug into age-old templates and carry further into the electorates consciousness than careful argument or detailed analysis of the facts on the ground. No doubt it was ever thus, to some extent, but this survey of the toolbox of the political storyteller - from deep structure to rhetorical style to the mainstreaming of conspiracy theories, with a nod to key story theorists like Aristotle, Syd Field and Joseph Campbell - goes a long way to account for the recent successes of provocative populist leaders around the world. Interesting and readable, this is an enlightening guide to our current political moment.Childrens book of the weekWonderscape by Jenner Bell is published in paperback by Walker Books, priced pound. . Available nowJenner Bell, author of the international bestseller The Uncommoners: The Crooked Sixpence, has worked her magic again with this fantastic sci-fi offering. It starts with a bang: while on their way to school, Arthur, Cecily and Ren are accidentally sucked through a portal into an in-reality adventure game called Wonderscape, which exists in the year . The game, and the future, offer plenty of opportunities for otherworldliness, which Bell takes full advantage of. What makes this book stand out is its casual references to scientic concepts such as nanotechnology and cryptocurrency, as well as its celebration of humanitys heroes, including Newton, Edison and Wangari Maathai, who are cast as characters in the game. Bell does this with such finesse that the story never feels like a history or science lesson in disguise. If those references land with young minds, and readers want to discover more, they can do so in their own time theres no pressure to understand them in order to enjoy the story. All in, this is a fun-filled, character-driven, fast-paced, vibrant story - but together with its thought-provoking, science-embracing and hero-referencing narrative, it will almost certainly win both hearts and minds.BOOK CHARTS:.

It is typical of entrepreneurs that they should see opportunities even when faced with constraints and unfavourable circumstances it is considerably bolder to argue that the right measures to tackle the current crisis could potentially spark a second Scottish Enlightenment.Politicians may regard ambition, or vision, as their preserve, and Sir Tom readily concedes that there are areas of government expertise and freedom to act of which business people are mostly ignorant. A plan for partnership that involves the public and private sectors each allowing the other to get on with what it can do best is not now a vaguely desirable aspiration, but an absolute necessitywe are to weather the damaging effects of the coronavirus and its economic impact.The Higgins report, as Sir Tom argues, is long on recommendations and scant on the minutiae of how to implement them. The fact that essentially all job creation in the medium term will have to come from small to medium enterprisesis a good argument for support of the sort public sector can offer, and that the Scottish Government is calling for from the UK Treasury.Grants, loans, deferrals, development schemes and infrastructure investment are potentially useful government contributions all but the most vocal advocates of ldquorolling back the state would argue that the public sector is, with the current challenges, an essential component of recovery.It is not, though, just a matter of money and support ndash which government may be best placed to provide, but will ultimately be paid for by the taxpayer. Just as much, and perhaps more, can be done by getting out of the way of business, by reducing regulations, easing planning and employment restrictions, and cutting the bureaucracy that hampers SMEs and leads to delays and overspends on so many public sector projects.No one would fault the Scottish Government for having had other priorities until now, nor underestimate the challenges it has faced. But finding a way out may require a sht in thinking and priorities every bit as radical as those that had to be adopted to deal with the disease and to repurpose and restructure public institutions.In economic spheres, the Governmentrsquos primary task is provide clarity in outlining its aims, to listen to business expertise and provide firms with material support and ndash at least as important ndash freedom to manoeuvre, and to accept that new approaches and greater partnership will be essential in rebuilding.On several issues, including Prestwick, the commissioning of ferries, and large-scale infrastructure works, the Scottish Government would clearly have benefited from a closer engagement with business.While that may have been an understandable omission in recent months, the coming challenges ndash averting huge job losses, reconstructing the tourism, hospitality and arts sectors, finding new education and training solutions, and encouraging firms to innovate ndash will demand a more flexible and supportive position. The First Ministerrsquos acknowledgement that ldquowe have to recognise [failure to engage with business] as real and address it is a welcome step in that direction.Our current travails will not be overcome by politicians, civil servants, government institutions, civic bodies or private businesses acting on their own, or continuing to operate as they have done in the past. If we want to see Scotland not just prevail over the coming challenges, but prosper and build a stronger economy, a civil society and a better country, we need new partnerships and priorities."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-king-lear-mr-munch---bunch","story":"WHEN actors grow older they often decide to play King Lear.

The Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh has announced all jobs are at risk of redundancy and shows scheduled for this year have been scrapped.Meanwhile, Pitlochry Festival Theatre is facing making  people redundant ndash and going out of business by the end of the year. Across Scotland, the business fears that re-openings will be ruled out until the spring of  at the earliest.The Tron Theatre in Glasgow has confirmed its -year-old doors wonrsquot open again this year and its artistic director Andy Arnold warns of greater impact down the line. ldquoThe danger is thata building is allowed to close, it will never open again. When the Archeswent bust we assumed some other cultural organisation would come in and take up the rent. But they never did. You canrsquot really allow a theatre to close.He adds: ldquoWe are luckier than some theatres because we only rely on half our income from box office. We have the subsidy which really helps us. But others are in a terrible position.Scottish theatres are trying desperately to save every penny, until such times as the doors can be opened safely. The Kingrsquos Theatre in Edinburgh, for example, is asking those who have already bought tickets to forego refunds. The Gaiety in Ayr is in a perilous position, as is the Lemon Tree in Aberdeen.Producer Sonia Friedman, the talent behind West End hits such as The Book of Mormon and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, says that more than , theatres around the UK will be insolvent soon. ldquoBritish theatre, she said, ldquois on the brink of total collapse.The Ambassador Theatre Group is a hugely worrying case in point. ATG runs  theatres including the Kings and Theatre Royal in Glasgow, and the Edinburgh Playhouse.The company now has a net debt of poundm. And the worries are that the owners, the American equity company Providence, which owns ATG via two holding companies registered in the Cayman Islands, will sell its assets and move on.ATGrsquos theatres in Scotland run on advance ticket sales. Without shows to sell the debt canrsquot be serviced. The furlough scheme is currently allowing for staff to be retained, but for how long Already, the theatres have had to cancel huge money-making shows this summer such as Carole King musical Beautul, and Abba songsheet Mamma Mia! If panto doesnrsquot run there is a real fear for the business model. ldquoThe coronavirus has thrown businesses such as ATG, unable to access government-backed loans due to their high levels of debt, into crisis, said business journalist Sabah Meddings this week.But the worry over theatre extends beyond keeping buildings sound and paying the bills. The business threatens to lose the armies of lighting programmers, freelance writers and dancers, the sound system suppliers, the caterers and the lorry companies who transport sets. Some are facing millions of pounds of hire purchase debt on equipment and canrsquot make the payments. Andyou have no set builders, trucking or sound companies there is no touring theatre.There is no argument that theatre wonrsquot be missed. Britainrsquos theatres draw audiences of  million each year ndash twice that of the English football Premier League. James Graham argues: ldquoIts not that arts funding costs hospital beds. We can pay for hospital beds through our theatres and our films.\" In the UK last year pound.bn of tickets sales were sold. Andy Arnold says: \"For every pound you put into the arts you get five pounds back.But theatre needs the majority of bums on seats. The break-even for most theatres is  per cent capacity. And evenyou achieve this, how can you recreate public confidence when social distancing is relaxed  Actor David Tennant pointed out: ldquoYoursquore asking people to pay a lot of money to potentially have someone coughing into their packet of boiled sweets and infecting them. One independent producer in Scotland summed up the predicament: ldquoHow do you market yourself out of this shitstorm Theatre organisations such as the Society of London Theatres ndash whose thoughts are echoed north of the border where funding is devolved ndash are arguing the business has to be a special case for extending the furlough.The UK Government is now telling people to go back to work, but that canrsquot apply when the doors are closed. The theatres, itrsquos argued, need to be given insurance in the form of shortfall fundingit costs poundk to put on a show and the company makes poundk then the government makes up the dference.Timersquos cruelty is conspiring against the survival of theatre in another form. It takes months of planning, sometimes a year, to bring a show to the stage.Eventhere are no more Covid-related deaths in Scotland this year and doors can be safely opened in the autumn, there will be a real shortage of shows. Certainly, the large-scale productions wonrsquot be appearing. And the following year could conversely see a pile up of producers desperate to see their shows run.Yet, there are signs for optimism. SOLT are currently trying to agree on principles whereby strict social distancing isnrsquot required, talking to public health agencies, to try and reopen in the autumn.The idea is that audiences will receive advance health questionnaires. Queues can be distanced, temperatures taken, masks worn, skin covered, theatres deep cleaned and sanitised.The optimists may well point to the South Korean casewhereby the country managed to keep most of its large-scale venues open during the pandemic.All audience members were required to have their temperature checked upon entry as was each member of the production cast and crew.There are other positive signs. From next week, Italian theatres will reopen. And in London, the immersive production of The Great Gatsby is set to be performed in October,after closing in March.Whatrsquos also clear is the likes of Glasgow City Council wonrsquot be keen to see the Kingrsquos Theatre and Theatre Royal mothballed. These theatres are reckoned to make poundm profit a year, andATG do walk away, others will surely step in.Whatrsquos obvious is there is an immense will to keep theatrersquos heart beating in Scotland, until fully revived. One theatre producer is already making plans to borrow enough money to pay a cash-strapped sound company an advance on future engagements, in order to ensure their survival.Itrsquos not a plan formed on altruismthe sound company goes out of business it will be next to impossible to find a substitute with the same skills.Cameron Mackintosh says theatre wonrsquot open again until spring of next year, but that doesnrsquot have to be the case.Andy Arnold says hersquos ready to create theatre ndash in some form ndash just as soon as groups are allowed to form. ldquoIt wonrsquot be people sitting together in rows, but we will find a way to make it happen, whether itrsquos promenade theatre or whatever.It may happen outdoors. It could be in a giant tent. ldquoInitially, I may have to look at productions geared to younger people. They seem more likely to take the chance in coming to theatre. Younger people arenrsquot so frightened. They will go out there.He adds: ldquoTheatre online is a substitute. But itrsquos not theatre. Live theatre has survived since Greek times because itrsquos so important to cultural le. It has to . And I hope to be doing something by the autumn.Will Scottish councils take the chance on letting theatres close  ldquoItrsquos a huge risk, says Arnold. ldquoHopefully, the government will realise itrsquos just too big a price to pay.Theatre needs help to allow time to . The Scottish Government said recently: ldquoWorking alongside [councils], Scottish Enterprise and Creative Scotland we are looking into what financial support can be offered.That, along with the work being done by pressure groups in London, has to be a positive.Oscar Wilde wrote: ldquoTheatre is the most immediate way in which a human being can share with another the sense of what it is to be a human being.At this moment in time, Scotland is crying out for that shared experience. We have never needed theatre more, say those in our arts world. To escape with others. To marvel. To be provoked. To laugh, to cry. To sit in wonder at a performance. To wonder, sometimes, how a production ever made it to the stage.Andy Arnold agrees. ldquoThe audience need that connection with the actors. The actors need to see those dferent faces every night.

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

Elaine Tulloch, chief executive of Destination Orkney Ltd, said: “We were delighted with the response our recent call to action received from our -strong membership. The four new directors, who have now been co-opted onto our board, bring a range of valuable skills and experience to the table and we very much look forward to working with them during these critical months ahead. “Having a strong board presence, which is fully representative of the trade, is essential as we develop recovery plans with local partners, agencies and regional and national governments.”Orkney’s tourism industry, worth over £ million a year to the islands’ economy, has been hard hit by the COVID- crisis.During the pandemic, Destination Orkney Ltd has been keeping its members up to date with information on COVID- support and available funding streams, offering guidance, and lobbying locally and nationally, while sharing updates from the Scottish Tourism Alliance, Scottish Government, VisitScotland and other national bodies.In order to develop COVID- Orkney recovery plans with partners, Destination Orkney Ltd has also established an industry recovery group to discuss matters such as reopening, communication and marketing, as well as identying future resource and investment needs and opportunities. copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens.”In line with this, the council is asking people to provide their own face coverings when travelling by ferry, bus, plan, taxi or private hire cars. People who are not able to wear a face covering for specic medical reasons will be exempt, as will children under five.Orkney Ferries timetables are currently being revised in consultation with Community Councils in the North and South Isles. It is hoped that an enhanced service can be provided after Monday, June .Further information about this will be provided next week.In the meantime, the Council is asking public transport users to please be patient and consider others needs when planning future travel – and thanking people for their help and co-operation with this.Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website. This advice is being updated to include full details of the applicable exemptions.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Caravans and self-contained accommodation which does not share services to be permitted, with caution to respect rural communities and the islands.July  — Outdoor restaurant and dining services and beer gardens to open.July  — Extension likely to be made to socialising with other households. Further details to follow in coming days.July  — Outdoor sports to resume and shopping centres to reopen.July  —  Meeting  indoors with up to two other households to be allowed, with physical distancing and attention to hygiene indoor learning and childcare service to resumeholiday accommodation, museums, galleries, monuments, cinemas and libraries to reopen . This will NOT include theatres, bingo halls and casinos.Pubs and restaurants will also be able to reopen indoors, on limited basis. But before you head for a drink, you#ll be able to get that much-needed chop at the hairdressers or barbers.Ms Sturgeon explained that other Phase Three plans, such as communal gatherings including weddings and funerals, will require further consideration. Changes to guidance around this is unlikely to take effect before July .The First Minister also confirmed Scotland#s aim to move away from blanket guidance for all shielding people, with hopes instead of more tailored advice.She said: #Our challenge, which is not an easy one, is to manage all of this change while keeping this virus firmly under control.#If, at any stage, there appears to be a resurgence, our path out of lockdown will be halted — and we may need to go backwards.#To avoid that, we must get as close as possible to elimination of the virus now.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is important that we face our fears and do not avoid them.“The enjoyment we might get from moving more freely outside, travelling and meeting friends and family is tempered when we are worried about the spread of infection. By sticking to the rules during the gradual lting of restrictions, we can be confident that risk won’t rise.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

Lets hope I am proved wrong for the greater good of everybody  The way that poll is set up will skew the result in favour of the wind farm.WIth respect, a #gas-fired power station# on its own is not a possible option since a substantial amount of renewable energy is already installed and it won#t be going away, any time soon. Renewable energy, of course, must have a grid link and a fully-specied standbyplant to cover cable failures. Having two options involving a gas-fired power station obviously splits the vote for that option.Firstly:I am really confused about what this poll is supposed to achieve at this stage in the process and why,it#s important, the Shetland Times didn#t hold it  years ago.It seems that the Shetland public have already voted to reject the Shetland Times# wording of this question so I think it#s time to withdraw the poll and re-launch a new one.Might I suggest that the ST editors consult John Tulloch and an equally well qualied renewables engineer over the wording of the new question so that the public can vote on TWO clear options that are technically feasible, otherwise, it is a wasted exercise. However you re-word the question, you need to deny local votersthe#I agree in principal that we need to work towards renewables but I have certain reservations with the current proposals as they stand# meandering, all-things-to-all-people, non-committal, sort of response.Of course,the oil companies hadn#t paid the hippies to shut down the nuclear power stations, we wouldn#t be having this debate.** Bonus conversation starter.Correct meI am wrong, but didn#t BP consult with Hydro-Electric Board in a possible scheme to pipe directly to the power station gas in which to generate power for the islands, but the Hydro-Electric Board decline to take part in the scheme in the late #s, I think    It seems this option would still be available to the Hydro-Electric Board with the planned construction of a new power station just north of Lerwick  Would this now be the case    .."},{"url":null,"title":"freight vessel runs aground on approach to aberdeen ","story":"A NorthLink freight vessel ran aground in Aberdeen on Thursday morning. was coming to the harbour towards the end of her overnight sailing south from Lerwick. she ran aground in the fairway channel at around .am.Harbour tugs were dispatched to assist the ferry, and another vessel on the scene also provided assistance.The vessel is now alongside the harbour.

More perplexing was the apparent lack of imagination or government will to procure the extra resources, staff, transport and buildings that may have allowed more children towhile observing physical distancing.Eventually, political and parental pressure # combined with more encouraging news on the suppression of the virus # led to this week’s climbdown.But questions remain as to how the revised arrangements will work.In a week where it emerged that Covid- could cost Highland Council nearly £ million, it is understandable that education chair John Finlayson is frustrated over the allocation of resources.As opposed to every request having first to be evaluated in Edinburgh, he urged the Scottish Government to “give the local authorities the additional funding so they can get on with things”.“Time is short,” the former headmaster added.We should also recognise that teachers will have every right to feel aggrieved.For weeks they and other education colleagues have been preparing plans, liaising with parents and helping to kit out classrooms to ready themselves for a socially distant re-opening in August.Yet days before the end of term, they are now heading for a summer of uncertainty and face having to come up with a new set of operating guidelines.At a time when measures have still to be reduced for the wider public, teachers have been told that social distancing in schools will not apply at all.As EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan pointed out this week: “Why would it be mandatory to wear a face covering on public transport but not in a classroom “Why would a till assistant be protected by a Perspex sheet but not a teacher “There cannot be a social distancing rule for outside of schools and a dferent one for inside classrooms.”In some quarters the teachers’ unions have been accused of being obstructive to the prospect of schools re-opening.But in the face of a virus which has shown just how much society depends on these key workers, they are right to stand up for the interests of their members.The trade union faced similar criticism the last time they called for a teachers’ pay-rise.Would anyone, especially parents after more than three months of classes at the kitchen table, argue against that now The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PARKING-FAIRY-POOLS-4.jpg","title":"letters mothball tourism until vaccine praise for responsible","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineOn a purely local, Highland level, with Test, Track and Trace in place, there is much to commend that view.There is also a view widely supported that the Tourist Industry should be restarted.I use the phrase Test, Track and Trace because it closely illustrates what must be done.I asked VisitScotland how many tourists they expected this summer in the Highlands. They had absolutely no idea.What we can surmise is that to anyone where in the UK this looks like a great, safe, destination.It doesn’t really matter because one infected person, , could result in  being infected  days later, and, unchecked, every three days after that the number of infections doubles.If you were on a family holiday and you had very mild symptoms, would you report them, or think you had a summer cold Let us be absolutely clear that the only reason this “R” number is where it is, is because we have all been kept in our homes to stop the virus spreading.The virus is still out there.The stated defence, in fact the only defence, , against that happening is Test, Track and Trace.How do you Test, Track and Trace an itinerant population of “let’s say”  to  tourists who move their location pretty much every day I think inviting an unrestricted number of visitors to the fragile Highland communities is a huge risk.Don’t think I don’t understand the economic consequences. My we and I run a very well-regarded BB taking people from all over the world.This year we will have none.Most BBs are not going to go bust, the owners are living in their own homes.Not so with hotels. So, we need a dferent answer anyway, because the chances are the hotels are not going to make up the number of bed-nights they need to survive in the next three or four months.Both the businesses and their staff need protection.Liquidators and Receivers should be instructed, by Government, to close the business downto stop the ebb of money, and either protect them from creditors, or much better pay the creditors with Government sponsored bank loans, keeping a close record of that expenditure. Perhaps they could also pay the staff They should mothball the business waiting for the day a vaccine or a cure is found, and it can re-open safely, and be handed back to the previous owners. The owners would then be given favourable, very long-term loans to pay back the costs met by the liquidators and receivers.There will be a cost, but a cost the owners can later meet, over many years, at low or virtually zero interest rates. The Government should not foot that bill, but it could facilitate it.I do not for one micro second forget the massive and fantastic contributions to health and care workers, and those on the front line who delivered to our doors at this time.However, my respect and admiration goes to the owners and staff of tourist and hospitality businesses.The financial and mental strains needing to remain optimistic, to remain as responsible employers and to face the financial crisis that this pandemic has brought, needs some recognition.I am sure the cost to trade and business may never truly be known, but must exceed millions of pounds.To those who kept us all safe, by cancelling visitors and closing shops, restaurants, hotels and tourist attractions at this testing time, simple words of thanks are not in any compensation for the vast loss in revenue from the sector.But I would just like to thank all those ethical and responsible businesses that did the right thing, and helping to decrease the possibility of the spread of this virus.The sacrices of owners and staff will not be forgotten, and I would urge all local people to rally round and support these businesses when it is safe to do so.Tourism and hospitality is the mainstay and leblood of our local economy, and with everyone#s help, in time it will recover.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bbc-salisbury.jpg","title":"timely salisbury series showed ordinary people doing the best in an unprecedented","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineMy kids seemed to have survived this oversight in their upbringing although in high school it apparently caused some surprise among their pals.I should add it is not all books by candlelight. We do have movie nights in winter when we watch DVD’s and now Netflix through a data projector onto a large pull-down screen.It is almost a cinematic experience with the sound coming through my old-fashioned stereo and its big speakers on the wall.Very occasionally though I get to hear about a television drama that sparks an interest.Mostly they are forgotten asthey are any good, they are released on DVD or online as a mini-series, like Sherlock, produced by Skye’s own Douglas Mackinnon, and I can enjoy them at my leisure, glass and popcorn in hand while lying on a sofa.Last week however, I heard about the BBC drama The Salisbury Poisonings, an adaptation of the real events following the attempted murder of a former Russian spy in , and the ensuing public health danger.The series was timely.There was talk of tracking and tracing, areas were locked down, and there was a possible spread of an invisible deadly nerve agent.Containment was the key.Viewers now have an understanding and comprehension about much of the unfolding events, that they perhaps wouldn’t have had, were it screened four months earlier.Contamination through contact from surfaces such as light switches and work surfaces and Salisbury business owners complaining at a public meeting of a  per cent drop in trade due to the cordons in their streets.Much of what happened would strike a chord with many, as would the uncertainty of it all.I managed to watch the three episodes, albeit a few days after they were broadcast, and was struck how the story was a human one.It was about ordinary people doing the best they could in an unprecedented situation.It was seemingly very true to le. The screenplay was written after many interviews with the real players, who we meet briefly in a moving vignette at the end.The main protagonist was director of public health for the local authority Tracy Daszkiewicz.She found herself transported from doing the school run on the way to her perhaps ordinary council job, to making decisions in overflowing conference rooms with senior police officers, Porton Down chemical warfare experts and Whitehall representatives, the outcome of which could either prevent or mitigate the deaths of thousands of people.At times Daszkiewicz sits in her car with her head on the steering wheel, fighting back the tears and trying not to be overcome by the gravity of it all.Her agenda, quite simply was to protect the health of the people.As lockdown begins to be eased in Scotland, we know well enough that there is a balance between lives and livelihoods, health and the economy, mental and physical well-being, and consequence for the future.Decisions are being made daily as to how to ease the country back into a new normality in the most appropriate manner.These decisions are beginning to be politicised, and the old adversarial ways are beginning to rear their ugly heads in the chambers of our government.It is correct that decisions are scrutinised, and justication is asked for in public, but knee jerk criticism for political posturing is untimely, and often disingenuous.We are still very much in a public health crisis.The future is unknowable, and whatever path is taken, there will be negative consequences.It is not at all cut and dried or in any way unambiguous.Mark Twain popularised the quote “lies, damned lies and statistics”, but numbers are persuasive.If we are to believe the figures gleaned from the internet, England with  times the population has approximately  times the average daily new cases and hospital admissions, and  times the deaths.In England, the Westminster government is handling the crisis dferently, perhaps with a dferent agenda and a dferent emphasis on the balance between the health of the economy and the health of the population.Perhaps they have dferent priorities, but I have medic friends who are glad they live in Scotland, and worry how things might pan out south of the border.Lockdown couldn’t, and cannot last forever.The new normal must include commerce which must include tourism, but when I hear tourism representatives arguing for a reduction in the distance of social distances in order to protect jobs and businesses, I wonder, how many extra deaths should we allow in order to allow a pub to open.There are always dferent viewpoints and it takes real wisdom to be able to consider all perspectives.When the lobbyists and business sector leaders want relaxations to protect their interests, I hope they realise the bigger picture, and no decision which may preclude their ruin, would be taken lightly or flippantly.The collateral damage of closed down businesses I am sure will weigh heavily on the consciousness of our political leaders.I am reminded of a cartoon I have seen used in conflict resolution courses. Two people are looking at a number drawn on the floor from opposite angles, with the phrase “just because you are right doesn’t mean to say I am wrong”The number is of course a , or is it a  It is clear that the sliding and phasing of the opening of tourism and recreational facilities is to keep a slowly-slowly approach to prevent a flood of movement of people and the virus.They could have said folk with brown eyes are allowed out on Tuesdays and Thursdays, anything to stem a possible tide.An aspect of leadership is to be able to make dficult decisions, taking all criteria on board often in the face of criticism, trying to see the big picture in the face of uncertainty.A change of decision, a backtrack or U turn seems to be regarded as weakness by an opposition, although I have never understood why.Surely it shows strength of character to realise that a chosen path might not be the best, and that a dferent option might be better.There has been some discussion about female leaders acting dferently and perhaps more appropriately in the face of the current pandemic.I wonderSalisbury was lucky having a female director of health,the poisoning drama is to be believed. Tracy Daszkiewicz acted with incredible professionalism and complete integrity, with compassion and humanity.Political allegiances aside I believe that the same could be said of our own leader in Holyrood, a person doing an extraordinary job in an unprecedented situation.I wonderNicola Sturgeon sometimes stops her car puts her head on the steering wheel and weeps at the gravity of it all.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3168924.jpg--.jpg?1591864132000\n","title":"nie meter readers ready to call again","story":"NIE Networks is to resume its meter reading activities across Northern Ireland after the service was temporarily paused due to COVID- restrictions.

Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication.

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Unity of Purpose group was in the news earlier this month when it called for the postponement of a Black Lives Matter rally which was held in Derrys Guildhall Square on June . In a statement, which was issued through the City Centre Initiative in Derry, the group said they understood and supported the reasons for the rally, but added that they believed it should be called off due to public safety concerns in relation to the coronavirus pandemic. However, despite the appeal, the rally went ahead and police subsequently issued  fines to people taking part in the protest. googletag.cmd.push In its recent statement, a spokesperson for theUnityofPurposegroup said it consists of local MPs, MLAs, the Mayor and statutory and business leaders within Derry. In the wake of the Black Lives Matters rally,Shaun Harkin and Eamonn McCann, People Before Profit councillors on the local council, criticised the stance of the Unity of Purpose group and called for the group to disband. The Unity of Purpose group did not respond to the councillors criticisms. Speaking at todays monthly meeting of the council, independent councillor Gary Donnelly accused the group of being very very selective on what they comment on. There have been a lot things that have happened in this city during the time that this group has been about and they have issued no statements. he said. googletag.cmd.push My concern is that they are not accountable, they dont respond and there is a council connection that I am deeply concerned about. I have seen photographs with councillors and I have seen photographs with council officers and I want to try and get some clarication on that. I want clarication on funding. Do we fund them directly or indirectly  I know there is a link to them through the City Centre Initiative. Far from saying what they say they do on the tin, their actions have led to people becoming more marginalised and excluded, added Cllr Donnelly. Speaking at todays meeting, Councillor Eamonn McCann described the Unity of Purpose group as a faceless organisation. He said it was unusual that there no inidual names attached to the recent statement issued by the group. Does this group have a policy document that we can look at  Does it have a constitution  Does it have a set of aims or a mission statement  Becausewe dont see that we are unable to work out in what way the opposition to the Black Lives Matter rally comes within their remit, said Cllr McCann. Cllr Donnelly proposed that the council carry out a report into connections between the council and the Unity of Purpose group. The matter was put to a vote and the proposal was carried, after  councillors voted to support it. Six councillors voted against the proposal.

While a more defined timeline is now in place, clubs should onlywhen they are ready to do so,saidIRFU Rugby Development DirectorColin McEntee. We have already seen a handful of clubs put a Covid- Club Health  Safety Plan in place and resume with reduced activities and we are delighted to see players being active again and reconnecting with their clubs. Given the restricted nature of these activities, we don’t see any clubs being left behind as we continue to work towards ato competition in September. I encourage all clubs to plan for that time with the highest safety standards in mind. PLAYER WELFARE  INJURY PREVENTION Workload volume and activity should be strictly controlled throughout these stages. This will be critical in terms of injury prevention as well as minimizing the risk of COVID- infection. IRFU Medical DirectorRod McLoughlinsaid: We must remember at all times that COVID- has not been eliminated from this island. It is critical that clubs continue to minimise risk and adhere to all public health measures in place. Rugby will onlyin a meaningful waywe adopt the right behaviours that will keep ourselves, our teammates and our club mates safe. He also urged clubs to take extra care with injury prevention measures for players. It has been over  days since any club player has been involved in competitive rugby and we have seen from other team sports that have ed earlier than rugby that there is an increased risk of injury. That means clubs will have to be extra cautious around the training loads they are putting in place. Player welfare still applies around injury prevention just as much as it does in terms of Covid-. PAPERLESS PRE-RETURN TO RUGBY PERSONAL ASSESSMENT DECLARATION FORM Clubs can avail of a new paperless Pre-Return To Rugby Personal Assessment Declaration Form week commencing theJuly th.The online version of the form will be available as part of the new RugbyConnect system. The form is an essential document in Covid- Health  Safety Planning.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work. Itrsquos not workyou love what you do, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Developers asked to show interest in Irish Street site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will shortly be asked to submit expressions of interest in transforming a major site in the heart of Downpatrick to help bolster the townrsquos economic recovery.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are driving ambitious plans to redevelop a near two acre site encompassing the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and the local authority-owned car park.While it was feared that the coronavirus pandemic could delay plans to redevelop of the huge site, work has continued on the project with a new brochure produced to provide would-be developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquos potential and secure expressions of interest.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the public virtually.Described as a ldquostrategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential and are working towards drawing up a development brief.While the former police base enjoys protected status, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come up with an imaginative plan for the historic building and that a preferred bidder will be appointed as early as October and as late as the end of the year.The council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.Council officials say that the Irish Street project is vital to the recovery of the local economy, improving the wellbeing of the community and a welcome confidence boost for the construction sector.In addition, they insist that theyrsquore committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the site and want to hear their feedback on the way forward.The steering group set up to oversee the Downpatrick scheme held a recent progress meeting and council chairwoman Laura Devlin said she was delighted with the projectrsquos momentum.She confirmed that councillors and local authority officials have been working with the Department for Communities and local stakeholders to develop an lsquoonline engagement processrsquo.She explained this is designed to inform the preferred end uses for the Irish Street site and allow key stakeholders to have input into the development brief which is critical to the success of the project.ldquoWhile the Downpatrick regeneration scheme is in the early developmental stages, it will also stimulate signicant investment for the local economy, she added.John Armstrong, from the Construction Employers Federation, said the scheme and a number of others the council is planning for the Newry area, will provide a boost for the local construction sector.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the progress being made on redeveloping he site.Mr Hazzard described the regeneration project as a ldquounique and exciting opportunity, one which has the potential to unlock much-needed economic and social opportunity for the town centre and wider community.ldquoThis regeneration project must act as a catalyst for the long overdue expansion of the townrsquos evening and weekend economy its new heartbeat in some respects, he continued.ldquoGiven the sitersquos close proximity to nearby homes, the project must also be viewed as more than a commercial development. It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents. The proposal has the potential to add a new vibrancy with local people helping shape how this key site will be transformed.Cllr Hanlon said she was pleased that the next stage of the sitersquos redevelopment is ready for launch, allowing potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to view the site online, with feedback from the local community welcomed.ldquoPeople will be able to give their views on the potential for the site and the likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained. ldquoAny feedback would be used to assist both the council and Department for Communities to prepare a development brief for the site.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe project to redevelop the former police base and surrounding area provides an opportunity to reinvigorate the Downpatrick town centre. This is the opportunity of a generation to restore a vibrant town centre and will build on the ongoing regeneration of the Irish Street area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing plans to catch owners over dog fouling  ","story":"DOG owners who fail to clean up after their pets could soon find themselves in court after local politicians agreed to investigate the potential of using DNA testing to catch offenders.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers have been instructed to examine the merits of testing dog dirt in a bid to trace animals whose owners allow them to use public areas as open air toilets.Under the scheme, a sample of dog dirt would be taken for analysis to trace the identity of the animal, with the owner being subsequently prosecuted.Agreement for officers to research the DNA issue was given at last weekrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee following a proposal tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines, suggesting that council officers draw upon best practice from other organisations who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.Council officials say they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme before compiling a report on its potential implementation.Cllr Billy Walker has welcomed the decision to investigate the DNA issue and says he cannot understand why dog owners to do not clean up after their pets.He said that the problem was district-wide and hoped that offenders will end up being prosecuted.ldquoI am an advocate of naming and shaming people on this particular issue but it is not a road which the council has been keen to go down. However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way.

Residents have been dismayed at the unauthorised work in a conservation areaIt was lighter than a normal peak time, more like a July rush hour. But there was enough traffic to make me wondermuch will change after lockdown, or whether we will go back to all our old habits.Of the many things that I dohope change in the future is a reduced appetite for large houses that are crammed into small urban sites, often wrecking a green setting that were there before.Such houses became almost fashionable in recent decades. Double income couples who were actually deterred by large gardens,rather than attracted to them, because they were too busy to tend them, but who wanted plenty of space to park  wheel drive cars.Thus there was a market for expensive homes with plenty of rooms but postage stamp gardens. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Perhaps that will go into reverse now that lockdown has reminded us all of the value of outside space.There are reports of a surge in demand for homeswith gardens outside cities such as New York and London, where flats had become ever more expensive in recent decades, so that homes in the further flung suburbs were vastly cheaper in comparison. Maybe a similar reversal will happen in greater Belfast, on a much smaller scale.Developers might then be less greedy in their aspirations for new homes in urban and suburban sites.Maybe now they will keep many more of the existing trees and leave more room for lawns and plant beds. Where once they would try to have squeezed in two houses perhaps they will now only build one.They will only do thisbuying habits change and it is harder to sell big houses on small plots.We certainly cannot rely on planners to protect our neighbourhoods or our countryside, and nor can we rely on politicians.Development controversies haveanything increased now that councillors in Northern Ireland have greater say over planning than they previously did. The Province’s planning policies and enforcement were already lamentably weak.There has been a raft of letters on these pages in recent months about bad planning in both town and rural. It shows that many people resent what is happening.In the countryside, on both sides of the Irish border, we allow single dwellings to be built in a chaotic, ugly manner which is not be tolerated in England, Scotlandor Wales.The problems do not just relate to new housing. In much of Belfast long established homes now have grossly over-sized extensions. In three other countries in which I have spent signicant amounts of time either living or on holiday —New England in the US, southwest France, southeast England — there is stricter planning.No-one would dare to breach regulations in such locations, or the structure would be pulled down.In Northern Ireland, most homeowners play by the rules but those who don’t enjoy near impunity. In my observation, retrospective planning is almost iniably granted to an inappropriate development.I remember uproar after a charming old house was pulled down in Bryansburn Road in Bangor West, drawing crowds of residents into the street in protest as a developer flattened the building.It was in a so-called ‘Area of Townscape Character’ where permission is needed. But weak planners rewarded the illegality by later waving through retrospective approval. Several Edwardian villas were also later flattened, and all the replacement buildings were uglier than what had stood there before.So it is no surprise to me to read of the planning row involving the Chinese consulate on the Malone Road. The site backs on to Adelaide Park, one of the finest old streets on this island. They do not build properties of that calibre any more.Protesting residents say it took weeks to get Belfast City Council interested — a local authority that hardly has a reputation for vigilance on conservation matters.I am surprised to learn that diplomatic immunity extends to ignoring planning lawsbut I am not surprised that China has discarded trivialities such as good neighbourliness.People around the western world readily take to the streets to protest about the failures of our free societies. They are in for a surpriseChina becomes the world’s superpower.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: Unionists ought to be able to connect with fierce SF critic Micheal Martin• Ben Lowry: The days are already getting shorter yet the turn was not so bad this year——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...When we entered lockdown, like many people I assumed that when the government lted the restrictions on our freedoms that I wouldto past habits– indeed that I would rush back with renewed zeal.\u2028But that expectation did not foresee the psychologicalchanges which occur during a period of enforced solitude as a household at a time of fear and death.While there are many activitieswhose resumption I relish, it is the simpler ones – being able to see the children hug their grandparents, or playing football with my friends – which are more important than being allowed to shop for a new sofa or yet another tie.AndI,as someone phlegmatic about the personal risk of contracting the virus and in a lower risk category, feel apathy at a rush back to activities such as non-essential shopping, the drop in demand will surely be exacerbated by those who have a deep fear of Covid- as well as those who simply no longer have any spare cash to spend.Butenough of us feel comfortable consuming far less, the temporary economic collapse during lockdown is likely to become a prolongedeconomicslump.Last Wednesday, the front page headline in the Belfastexpressed that bluntly: “Spend your cash to save our jobs”.The headline was based on the comments of Neil Gibson, the respected chief economist of business advisory firm EY Ireland.Highlighting that many people – especially in the public sector – had retained their full salaries and saved money during the shutdown, Mr Gibson said: “It will be our responsibility as citizens and as businesses to show confidence in the sectors of our economy that need it most.“This will require a collective effort to go out for a meal, to buy a coffee from our local cafe and to go to the cinema when they open.”In terms of economictheory, his logic is flawless –we all reduce our spending, the unavoidable consequence will be dramatic job losses.Those job losses are not even likely to hurt all sections of society equally.It already seems clear that the recession into which we have entered is disproportionately hitting women, the young and those who were already the poorest.This week the Belfast-based think tank Pivotal published a report which set out a landscape of economic devastation which, because it has been masked and delayed by unprecedented government support during the lockdown, does not appear to have been grasped by many people.The report said: “The scale of contraction in the Northern Ireland economy is estimated to be much faster and larger than previous recessions ...the nature of the Northern Ireland economy makes it vulnerable to not ing to ‘pre-Covid’ ing for some time,at all”.The report also noted some of the benefits of lockdown and the opportunities which it now provides for Stormont and councils to reshape Northern Ireland by addressing embedded problems.It noted that less travel has meant less congestion and cleaner air, that some businesses have adapted to create new products and find new customers, and that society now has greater appreciation of those essential workers who until now have in many cases been at the bottom of the social and salary scales.And yet herein lies a conundrum. On the one hand, many of us want to retain some of what we have valued about the last few months – the slower pace, the increased focus on our families, the appreciation of the small things in le, and the realisation that contentment is often not simply found in material gain.And yet on the other hand, we want to retain our salaries, and the paraphernalia which accompanied pre-pandemic prosperity.Whatthose two aspirations are incompatible Mr Gibson made clear that he was not advocating reckless spending and his argument was centred on local cafés and restaurants who are facing a brutal prognosissocial distancing rules remain.However, ato far wider consumerism will be necessary to avoid massive retail job losses, and then the associated impacts on other sectors such as the property market.Others have gone far further. Last month the French labour minister called on people to “consume” while the local government in Wuhan, the epicentre of the pandemic, created  million of ‘consumption coupons’ to encourage its residents to spend.One does not have to be a hardline socialist or an asceticto wince at the idea that we now have some sort of civic duty to go out and spend money on items we don’t need which damage the earth and clog our homes because otherwise there will be mass joblessness.As young people in particular become increasingly alarmed about the future of the planet, is an economy which depends on begging us to resume wanton consumerism, rather than focussing on what we need, ultimately sustainable If not, can and should the economy be rebuilt in a more productive and sustainable way While the answers to these questions will be influenced by global forces far beyond Northern Ireland, our politicians have considerable power to help shape whetherthe new economy is simply an attempt to replicate as much as possible of what went before.Already there are glimpses of new thinking in Stormont.To the surprise of some observers, the DUP environment minister Edwin Poots is already pursuing some innovative environmental policies –from a vast tree-planting programme to an attempt at massively increasing not just how much we recycle, but how much of that material is recycled in Northern Ireland rather than leaving our shores with no guarantee that it is actually reused.SDLP infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has energetically pledged major focus on expanding cycle lanes and pedestrianisation.Those projects both have the potential for signicant job-creation.\u2028This week’s report by Pivotal calls for “inclusive growth that benefits everyone in Northern Ireland” and which “should focus on good quality jobs that offer fair pay, security and progression prospects, underpinned by improved skills that enable people to access these opportunities”.If the immediate future is as economically grim as anticipated, the temptation will be for a desperate Stormont to simply encourage any jobs at all – regardless of their sustainability, environmental impact or how the workers are treated.If we want to retain some of the gains of recent months, with slower, simpler lives, it almost inevitably follows that we will be poorer – at least for some time.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public

rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than ,

favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally

support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.
