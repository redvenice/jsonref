They are so many models from other races black, Asian and so many more she is a role model for many young girls. This photoshoot is an insult to all the beautiful black women.’‘There’s a difference between getting a tan look (most of her pics) to actually changing her pigment to a shade of brown that a tan would never do AKA unnatural AF,’ says another.‘Also her face has been altered SO hard. This is an actual ongoing issue and POC should be hella offended, outta here with that privilege.’But not everyone believes that she’s been made to look ‘more ethnic’.‘Since when did fake tanned constitute as racist?

They have discovered the way to cure cancer, depression, Parkinson’s, and autism. The magic bullet to cure all ills? Poo.It may not be that surprising to hear that when scientists ‘transplanted’ the poo of a depressed person into a rat, the rat became depressed. Scientists at the APC Microbiome centre, at University College Cork, call it a trans-poo-sion.Luckily, there might be an easier way expect to see ‘psychobiotics’ coming to a Boots near you soon. These are probiotics that can lift your mood and protect your mental health.Marion O’Connor, dietitian for Halcyon Life Wellbeing \u0026amp Resilience Programmes, explains: ‘Gut bacteria can produce chemicals which are thought to travel via the vagus nerve to the brain.‘It was previously thought that nothing passed through this very important barrier. These chemicals have the potential to affect brain function and mental health.‘The use of psychobiotics in the future is an exciting prospect and may help those suffering from mental health issues.’Glenn Gibson, professor of food microbiology at the University of Reading, adds: ‘The gut-to-brain axis is one of research’s most exciting areas.“It seems products made by bacteria in the gut can have cognitive effects. We also know that a prebiotic like Bimuno can positively affect those bacteria. So, improved mental health is under the microscope, too.We think that a range of problems, like anxiety, depression, autism, migraine and dementia, may be helped.”Our obsession with cleanliness has destroyed a lot of the erse bacteria we need to stay healthy and happy.For instance, a more erse gut biome links to higher blood tryptophan levels in humans. Tryptophan turns into serotonin, the same mood-controlling neurotransmitter antidepressants target.No surprise that mice raised in a germ-free environment are more likely to be depressed, and those rats given gut bacteria from depressed humans become blue as well.When we commute on public transport, washing our hands afterwards is only sensible, as it can protect against cold and flu.If your kids want to roll around in the mud, however, it’s best to let them do it, despite the hassle of cleaning their clothes afterwards. For children exposed to dirt, dust, and animals are more likely to be healthier and happier adults.Eating too much sugar can also cause a bad bacterial overgrowth, as well as the use of antibiotics.(Picture: Ella Byworth for )Studies show eating plenty of raw fruit and vegetables, as well as fermented foods and fibre, leads to a healthier biome, and this affects your whole system. Unfortunately, that may mean swapping the Snickers for sauerkraut. Or it may not.The good news is that there is no one food that can help. What will affect one person adversely, may help another’s biome.However, obviously healthy food is generally better at boosting brain and gut symbiosis.Here is some of the latest research.Scientists have discovered a way that good bacteria in the gut can control genes in our cells.The work, published in January in Nature Communications, shows that chemical messages from bacteria can change the location of key markers throughout the human genome.The signal chemicals are made when bacteria digest fruits and vegetables. By communicating in this way, the bacteria may help to fight infections and to prevent cancer.These molecules, called short-chain fatty acids, can move from the bacteria and into our own cells. They can then trigger processes that change gene activity and ultimately affect how our cells behave.More and more, researchers have identified that the sea of microscopic organisms that reside within our gut microbiota may be influencing communications to the brain.Dr Ashton Harper, from Bio-Kult, states that in lab tests on mice, the bacteria lactobacillus rhamnosus was found to reduce anxiety and depression-related behaviour. However, interestingly this was dependent on an intact vagus nerve.He adds:’Research in humans from Denmark actually showed that having your vagus nerve cut (a type of surgery performed to treat stomach ulcers) reduces your risk of developing Parkinson’s disease by half, suggesting this nerve, and potentially the communication from the gut microbiota, may have a role to play in this infamous neurodegenerative condition.’And results have replicated in humans as well. A number of probiotic studies have also shown compelling evidence for improvement in mood and anxiety, although more evidence is required.This could possibly be due to the probiotics’ ability to enhance the gut barrier and prevent bacterial toxins from causing inflammation and triggering headaches, although this is yet to be determined.Stephen O’Hara, a microbiologist and chairman of OptiBiotix Health, has recently been involved in work on psychobiotics.He says: ‘The idea that the brain can influence the gut is well established just think of the effect on your bowel before an interview or stressful situation.‘A number of studies conducted on animals and humans have shown that bacteria in the gut (the microbiota) are critical for normal brain development and function.‘In the last decade, research has focused on how gut microbiota can affect the brain. This work has shown gut bacteria have the potential to modulate mood and behaviour, and are potential treatments for disorders, such as stress, anxiety, depression, and autism.’Dr Kevin Barrett, chairman of the Primary Care Society for Gastroenterology, adds: ‘The gut microbiome is a key part of the immune system.‘Imbalances triggered by diet, antibiotic use, stress, lack of exercise, and other environmental factors can increase the risk of developing auto-immune conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and inflammatory arthritis.‘There is a strong connection between the gut microbiome and levels of important neurotransmitters in the brain changes to the microbiome are linked to increased anxiety and depression.’Sarkis Mazmanian, a medical microbiologist from Caltech, has found ‘very powerful’ differences between the microbiomes of people with Parkinson’s and those without the disease. Studies in animals have shown gut bacteria is necessary for the disease to emerge.Yes, the reason you may have trouble losing weight could be down to having an unhealthy microbiome.Tracey Strudwick, a nutritional therapist at Nuffield Health, says: ‘Studies show different types of bacteria might be having an influence on weight. In one investigation, the gut flora of obese iniduals was found to have fewer different types of bacteria.‘These observations have led scientists to suggest this ‘obese microbiota’ may enhance signals that trigger the amount of energy we harvest from food, leading to weight gain and fat deposition.’Have you ever felt something isn’t right in the pit of your stomach? Not the rumblings of last night’s kebab (though that won’t help) but that ‘gut feeling’ you get about things.There is actually scientific evidence to back up the feeling.The vagus nerve at the base of the brain connects with the stomach, and signals when you feel anxious or nervous.Neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, fire between the gut and the brain, affecting everything from mood, satiety from hunger, to sleep. It’s also why you get butterflies in the stomachScientists have found a strong connection between inflammation and disease. Inflammation is rooted in the gut. When our food choices cause oxidative stress, it can lead to ailments such as depression, anxiety, and brain fog.The health of your gut directly affects the health of your brain. And, in severe cases, this can lead to more deadly consequences.Professor Simon Carding, head of the gut health and food safety research programme at Quadram Institute Bioscience, says: ‘In particular, antibiotics, if taken in sufficient doses and for long enough, can lead to the irreversible loss of large populations of bacteria and the emergence of opportunistic pathogens such as Clostridium difficile, which if left untreated can be fatal.’Which is why it is not a good idea to beg your doctor for antibiotics unless they are strictly necessary. In the future, it’s likely doctors will do tests to see how healthy your gut is.If you fancy getting your poo analysed, a project called British Gut can help.

The pair live in Barnaget, New Jersey.We spoke to Rahab about her relationship with Joe, and how they make it work.(Picture: RAHAB KIMANI  CATERS NEWS)Rahab and Joe met while they were both working as carers at a nursing home, and have now been together for over a year. Rahab told :‘We saw each other all the time and gave each looks but we never really had a full conversation by ourselves. I was getting ready to move to Boston with my sister and someone told me to ask him for big boxes, so I went to his office and asked him…‘We flirted back-and-forth and he asked me if I wanted to go out for dinner.’From there, they became a couple (with Rahab rethinking her decision to move), but have had to deal with judgement from other people.Rahab says, ‘My family was mad, disappointed, disgusted. I remember my sister didn’t even want to talk to me, my dad couldn’t even look at me, and my mom was mad but she was there for me.‘I don’t really have a lot of friends but the friends that I had at the nursing home they felt the same way as my family. Most of my friends are my cousins and I thought my cousins would be there for me and defend me when the rest of the family were saying disgusting and horrible things about me, but until today they still don’t defend me.She turned to Joe for solace, saying, ‘When a situation like this happens, what I do is I just distance myself and I go home and I cry to Joe. I don’t know exactly what they’re trying to do, but all they’re doing is just bringing me and Joe even closer.’In age-gap relationships, because the difference is right there for everyone to see instantly, it can illicit a reaction from people.It’s not always the healthiest thing to retreat into yourselves in situations like this, but usually the longer you’re together, the less this reaction will persist.People will eventually come round to you as a couple, rather than simply looking at the difference in age. In the meantime, all you can do is ‘do you’.Rahab also says that getting looks from family and strangers can hurt, although she tells us, ‘lately we haven’t been getting any looks whatsoever – or maybe I don’t notice it anymore.’Stopping yourself from caring about any weird looks or comments certainly isn’t the easiest thing in the world, but Rahab tells us it’s what you need to do to stay sane.Behind closed doors, Rahab says they have little niggles, but nothing major. She hates the way he snores at night and he hates the way she grinds her teeth in her sleep, and Rahab says: ‘No couple is perfect, especially not us.’One of the things that comes up time and time again in age-gap partnerships is the potential for a power imbalance.For Rahab and Joe this hasn’t been an issue – probably because they were working at the same place when they got together. However, when the older counterpart makes significantly more money or is in a higher position professionally, this can seep into your romantic life.If the older partner is used to getting what they want, particularly around younger subordinates, they may struggle to change their habits at home.It’s also worth noting the reason for them dating someone younger. Sometimes, it’s that you both just click, but in some situations it can be that they (consciously or subconsciously) want to take advantage of your naivete.Percy Pig is getting married so where the f*** is my ring?For Joe and Rahab, the age difference has actually benefited her more, as she feels more secure. She says, ‘The best part of being in a age gap relationship is Joe is very clean, so he picks up after me, does my laundry, cooks dinner every night, and takes real good care of me’.Not having to deal with a young guy who doesn’t know how to work the hoover is a huge plus for some. Rahab also says she enjoys, ‘not having to deal with other girls, not worrying about him texting other girls… Basically no bullsh*t.’Do people become more straightforward and honest as they age? Perhaps it’s always been Joe’s way. However, they’re still going strong after a year, so they’re certainly doing something right.MORE: Paul Hollywood’s ex-wife shares ‘easy tart’ recipe as Paul’s 22-year-old lover defends age gap"},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Markle Life UK test Royal Wedding British citizen","story":"    In order to become a British citizen, Meghan Markle will have to take the Life in the UK TestThis means that Meghan, as a prospective UK citizen, will have to take a ‘Life in the UK’ test in order to gain citizenship.To pass the test, which costs £50 and is compiled from roughly 3,000 facts, Meghan has to answer 18 out of 24 questions correctly on a range of topics including the height of the London Eye, when Britain became permanently separated from the continent by the Channel, and British environmental charities.Other typical topics include questions about how local councils are funded, what important event happened in 1066 and what are some examples of civil law.However, the test is tough, so tough in fact that even British citizens are struggling to pass it. A Reuters survey found that only 23 out of 41 Britons who took the test could answer the questions correctly - with many confessing that they were in fact guessing.Fortnite hit with child safety warning by NSPCCCarrie Bickmore launches new Beanies 4 Brain Cancer range on The Project Game of Thrones actor possibly drops season 8 spoiler on InstagramLove Island 2017 couples: Where are they now? Handmaid\u0027s Tale renewed for season 3World Press Freedom Day: All you need to knowWhen is Eurovision 2018 on in the UK and who is SuRie?Karate Kid sequel Cobra Kai: How to watch, cast, reviews and moreWho is Harriet Tubman?

This time, authorities are planning a permanent move (the elderly being evacuated in September)  In this photo taken in October, 2017, steam is seen rising from the volcanic cone that has formed in Lake Vui near the summit of Ambae Island, Vanuatu Government spokesman Hilaire Bule told The Associated Press he expects the Council of Ministers to approve a relocation plan by next week.

Already hundreds of people have moved to temporary shelters on parts of the island that are not so affected by the ash.Ambae is about 400 square kilometers (154 square miles) and is one of about 65 inhabited islands in Vanuatu, which is home to 280,000 people.  Vanuatu sits on the Pacific\u0027s \u0027Ring of Fire,\u0027 the arc of seismic faults around the Pacific Ocean where earthquakes and volcanoes are common.          A Tannese boy stands in the doorway of his hut as volcanic ash covers the ground in the village of NamakaraBrad Scott, a New Zealand volcanologist with GNS Science who has been seconded to help Vanuatu authorities, said more than one-quarter of Ambae has been severely impacted, with many traditional thatch roofs collapsing under the weight of the thick ash.He said traditional gardens have been buried and killed in some places and water supplies have been discolored and the water tastes strange. He said there is lots of fine-grained ash, which can affect people\u0027s breathing and respiratory functioning.Other countries including France, New Zealand and Australia provided aid and financial help for the earlier evacuation. Australia on Thursday announced it was providing 300,000 dollars to help with the island\u0027s permanent evacuation, with a focus on the needs of women, children and people with disabilities.          Traditional gardens have been buried and killed in some places and water supplies have been discolored and the water tastes strange  Steam rises from the volcanic cone that has formed in Lake Vui near the summit of Ambae Island, Vanuatu Despite the problems, Scott said, many people want to stay put. \u0027There has been significant pushback in the community,\u0027 Scott said. \u0027Some people, suffering from significant ash fall, would love to be anywhere else on the planet. Others have strong cultural associations.\u0027Scott said the Manaro volcano on Ambae island had a large eruption about 400 years ago and has had several smaller eruptions over the past 100 years. There have been three phases in the current eruption, with the most recent phase, which started in March, producing the most ash.He said the volcano has actually quietened down over the past two weeks, although there is no way of predicting if and when the next explosive phase would begin.Asked if there was a chance that the residents might be able to one day move back to the island, Bule, the government spokesman, said that was not a question for him.\u0027We don\u0027t know,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027ll have to ask the volcano.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/11/4BCD920100000578-5686161-image-a-45_1525343837683.jpg","title":"Voters polls local elections London rest UK","story":"    Millions of voters are heading to the polls today for local elections and Prime Minister Theresa May could face a political wipeout in London.

The pictures are stunning.\u0027We\u0027re all so proud of our member for pooling their resources from all areas of beauty, fashion, photography, styling and make-up, to showcase just some of the skills in our group.\u0027It makes us realise that we can be just as glamourous as our Hollywood icons and shows the power of collaboration with our members helping one another to build and grow their business.\u0027The networking group was created in 2017 to bring together like-minded mothers who wanted to set up their own dream companies whilst bringing up youngsters.          The 13 \u0027mumpreuners\u0027 involved have 34 children between them, aged from 18 months to 15 years old          The mothers have all given up corporate life to set up their own businesses in everything from photography to event planning          Unlike the real expensive Vanity Fair shoot, the mother created the shoot by asking for help from their 125-strong members          Members of the Cotswold-based The Mum Boss Club include hairdressers, makeup artists, and venue owners          In less than 18 months, the group has brought together a 125 mothers, all who run their own businesses in Gloucestershire          The group helps like-minded mothers who wanted to set up their own dream companies whilst bringing up childrenIn less than 18 months, it has brought together a 125 mothers, all who run their own businesses in Gloucestershire, and believe working for themselves was \u0027the best thing I ever did\u0027.The Vanity Fair style shoot was the brainchild of Ms Davies - who posed as Harrison Ford. She got the idea while watching E! News at the time of the release of the 2018 Vanity Fair cover, in January this year.Now in its 24th year, the issue featured Nicole Kidman, Tom Hanks, Jessica Chastain, Harrison Ford, Michael B Jordan, Zendaya and Gal Gadot.After calling around the mothers, Ms Davies\u0027s shoot came together with venue, hair, makeup, photography and dresses all provided by mothers within the group.Ms Davies, who left her job as a designer in London, said: \u0027It was a really hard decision. I was commuting from Cheltenham to Gloucester twice a week for five years before I finally left my job. \u0027My husband said that I never really left London. But it was the best decision I\u0027ve ever made. My whole life seems to have changed, and I\u0027ve never been happier. The first few months were a really tricky time.

By October 2016 I was doing events for mums, and then I won the UK Blog For Parenting Award in 2017.\u0027I started the Mum Boss Club in early 2017 to empower other mums like me to come together and provide the support and networking opportunities they need to live the life they want and run the business of their dreams.\u0027           The collective of entrepreneurial mothers is known as \u0027Mum Boss\u0027 and was formed just over a year ago in the Cotswolds          One mother got the idea while watching E! News at the time of the release of the 2018 Vanity Fair cover, in January this year          One of the mothers involved in the photoshoot in Cheltenham won the UK Blog For Parenting Award in 2017          The shoot followed the Vanity Fair issue which featured Nicole Kidman, Tom Hanks, Jessica Chastain and Harrison Ford          After calling around the mothers, Ms Davies\u0027s shoot came together with venue, hair, makeup, photography and dresses          Two of the mothers get their hair and make-up ready for the photoshoot, which took place in the Gloucestershire townMs Starkey added she soon had to make the club subscription-based, due to the rapid following it gained. She said: \u0027It was scary. It\u0027s all been a big risk. But it\u0027s the best thing I ever did, and I would absolutely recommend it.\u0027I\u0027m very lucky that I\u0027m happily married, so I\u0027ve had that support to design a life I love. But I would also say that the number of people I count as close friends has trebled in the last couple of years.\u0027Ms Ryder, who posed as Zendaya, runs her own fitness classes for mothers from her garden. She said the mother photoshoot sends a powerful message.She gave up her job of 15 years as a project manager at Microsoft to start up Fit Inside Out Ltd. Ms Ryder said: \u0027What I really hope people take away from this photoshoot is that we\u0027ve all taken risks to follow our passions.\u0027It\u0027s not like it\u0027s been easy for us to do this because we can fall back on the income of our other half. Me and my partner deliberately decided to take less of an income so that I could do this, and so we could spend more time with our kids. I hope that message comes across - that it\u0027s perfectly okay to just follow your passion. \u0027And hopefully it\u0027s a message that the Mum Bosses can teach our kids, too. The big question is, can mothers have it all? And I think in this day and age, the answer is: yes they can.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/12/4BCBDAB600000578-0-image-a-16_1525346858569.jpg","title":"Windsor prepares Prince Harry Meghan Markles Royal wedding","story":"    Preparations have begun in earnest for the second Royal event of the summer as Prince Harry prepares to tie the knot with actress Meghan Markle. Heartwarming pictures show residents in the historical market town of Windsor getting into the full spirit of the event with pubs decorating their windows with royal memorabilia, bunting and Union Jacks adorning the walls          A gift shop selling trinkets dedicated to all things royal has a life size cutout of the happy couple peeking out from the front door welcoming customers inA gift shop selling trinkets dedicated to all things royal has a life size cut-out of the happy couple peeking out from behind the front door welcoming customers inside.Bunting has been hung from turret to turret with Union Jacks waving in the breeze ahead of an expected heatwave throughout May, delivering what royal fans hope will be a perfect spring wedding for the 33-year-old prince.While locals have been spotted soaking up the sun outside pubs adorned with royal memorabilia, including one with a cut-out of Harry and Meghan peering out through a top window looking down on the happy revellers.\u0027It\u0027s not too late!\u0027 Meghan Markle\u0027s brother Thomas pens...Ready for rain or shine!

In exchange, Iran regained access to the global banking system and could sell its oil again on the world market.Airplane manufacturers, carmakers and others have rushed into Iran after the accord. However, some Western firms have grown increasingly reluctant to enter the market, in part over Trump\u0027s constant criticism on the campaign trail and from the White House on the deal.While directly criticizing the U.S. and Europe, Zarif did appear to leave some wiggle room for possible negotiations, however.          Earlier this week, Iran branded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an \u0027infamous liar\u0027 after he claimed Tehran still has a top secret nuclear weapons programme. Netanyahu is pictured describing his claims on Monday          Netanyahu\u0027s speech was delivered in English and relied on his trademark use of visual aids\u0027It is Iran, and not the West, that has serious grievances and much to demand,\u0027 Zarif says.That comes as Iran\u0027s hard-line Revolutionary Guard continues to detain a number of dual nationals, Western citizens and others . Analysts and family members of dual nationals and others detained in Iran say hard-liners in the Islamic Republic\u0027s security agencies use the prisoners as bargaining chips in negotiations with the West.A U.N. panel in September described \u0027an emerging pattern involving the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of dual nationals\u0027 in Iran, which Tehran denied.The video comes amid intense lobbying on Trump from all sides. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself earlier this week gave an English-language presentation on what he called a \u0027half ton\u0027 of Iranian nuclear documents illicitly seized by Israeli intelligence.Netanyahu said the documents provided evidence that Iran attempted to develop a nuclear bomb in the 2000s.

It was against that background that they plotted their own attack upon the school they attended.\u0027In that attack, they intended to shoot and kill other pupils and teachers against whom they held a grievance.\u0027They also, like their heroes, intended to deploy explosives and researched bombing-making techniques to that end.\u0027Mr Greaney said: \u0027They intended a re-enactment of the Columbine High School Massacre although fortunately, in the result, they were stopped before their plans were put into action.\u0027The defendants sat outside the dock, behind their lawyers, in Court 1 of Leeds Crown Court as Mr Greaney began to outline the case. Both sat with their mothers and one was wearing school uniform.Both deny a joint charge of conspiracy to murder relating to a period between December 31 2016 and October 29 2017  The schoolboys allegedly hero-worshipped Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold (left to right)They have also each pleaded not guilty to a charge of intentionally encouraging or assisting an offence and a charge of encouraging or assisting an offence believing it would be committed. The two defendants agreed at some stage no later than late September 2017 to commit murder at the school they attended - but their plan was foiled before being put into action, the jury was told.The older boy, who appeared to be the leader of the two plotters, condoned the Columbine High School Massacre and modelled himself on Harris, it was said.Diary entries revealed he kept deeply offensive Nazi and anti-Semitic views. A hideout made in an abandoned shack at the rear of a Londis Store was discovered which included materials capable of being used in bomb-making.Mr Greaney QC told a jury this cache of items, which included petrol and a bag of screws, provides evidence this plan was real and not fantasy.During April 2017, senior school staff discovered a fake account had been set up on the social networking site Instagram and was being used to post offensive images and comments about teachers.It was discovered one of the defendants had been involved in setting up the account.Both defendants downloaded a file entitled \u0027anarchistcookbook2000\u0027 and, when opened, gave the user access to a 241-page book called \u0027Anarchy Cookbook Version 2000\u0027.That book provides instructions on the manufacture of bombs, including pipe bombs and nail grenades, and explosives, including napalm and nitroglycerin, a jury was told.Mr Greaney QC added: \u0027During May 14 and 15, 2017, {the older defendant} conducted Internet research on the manufacture of bombs.\u0027He accessed sites including \u0027Easy Explosives to Make\u0027 and \u0027Make a Bomb Out of Household Items\u0027.\u0027On May 16, 2017, the defendants had a significant conversation on an instant messaging platform in which the younger defendant said: I can\u0027t be bothered anymore.The older boy replied with \u0027Why not take some others out as well\u0027 before sending another message which read: If you\u0027re gonna kill yourself, shoot up the school.\u0027The conversation occurred not in a vacuum, but rather in the context of adoration of the Columbine killers, the acquisition of a bomb-making manual and the carrying out by {the defendant} of further research to that end, \u0027 added the prosecution.  The pair were arrested in late October 2017 and, during police interview, one of the boys said everything was fantasy, a court heard.The second boy maintained he had initially believed his friend was joking but later he came to believe he did intend a massacre, and thereafter, acted to prevent it taking place, a jury was told.One of the boys is also accused of aggravated burglary on October 21 last year. He is also accused of maliciously wounding a woman on September 4, 2017.The boys, now aged 15, have pleaded not guilty to all the charges and are standing trial at Leeds Crown Court. Neither of the defendants nor the school can be named. The trial, which is likely to last a month, continues. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/10/4BCC3B0C00000578-0-image-m-50_1525338771351.jpg","title":"Mother two 27 swindled 14 500 benefits","story":"    Katie Moran, 27, claimed Universal Credit from the Department for Work and Pensioners on the grounds that she was a single mum-of-two and had no income or savings, despite having a long term partnerA benefits cheat claimed more than £14,500 after telling authorities she was a single mother-of-two with no income or savings, despite sharing a home with her partner.   Katie Moran claimed Universal Credit from the Department for Work and Pensioners on the grounds that she was a single mum-of-two and had no income or savings. The 27-year-old, of Daisy Bank, Bacup, Lancashire, was overpaid £14,466.83 worth of benefits over a 14-month period from February 22, 2016 to May 1, 2017. Moran pleaded guilty at Burnley Magistrates Court to dishonestly making a false statement or representation to the DWP to obtain Universal Credit. She was given a 12-month community order with a 10-day rehabilitation activity requirement, a four week curfew and ordered to pay £50 costs and an £85 victim surcharge. Prosecutor Andrew Robinson told the court that her claim was \u0027fraudulent from the outset\u0027 and the DWP had evidence from \u0027various sources that she was maintaining a common household\u0027. NAB posts a massive $2.58BILLION profit as they\u0027re caught...Share this articleHe said: \u0027The DWP will take their own steps to recover the money that was overspent.\u0027Defence solicitor Ben Leech said Moran would regularly separate and get back together with her partner Robert Carter in a \u0027continuing pattern\u0027 and at the time of making the benefits claim she did not think they would reconcile. Mr Leech said: \u0027Mr Carter, despite the problems, continued to provide some financial support. \u0027Quite properly the DWP see it as a continuing financial relationship which Miss Moran, when spoken to, had to concede.   The 27-year-old, of Daisy Bank, Bacup, Lancashire, was overpaid £14,466.83 worth of benefits over a 14-month period from February 22, 2016 to May 1, 2017\u0027There was money going into her bank from Mr Carter over periods when they weren\u0027t together and periods when they were living together. \u0027Miss Moran did contact them on a number of occasions to indicate there were periods when they were getting back together and periods when it was anticipated they would get back together and to some degree kept them updated, but accepts the full picture wasn\u0027t provided. \u0027I don\u0027t think this was a lady who had gone into this with any dishonest intent.\u0027 Mr Leech said health care assistant Moran has \u0027learned the error of her ways\u0027 and is \u0027very much ashamed and regrets her behaviour\u0027."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/09/0C18EEAF00000578-0-image-a-11_1525164194916.jpg","title":"Tourist spotted carrying dolphin shoulder catching beach","story":"A man is filmed carrying a marine animal at a beach in Hailing Island, China, on  May 1 (left).

The North Korean leader reportedly called the relation between Pyongyang and Beijing \u0027extremely precious\u0027 and vowed to reinforce and develop the \u0027friendly cooperation\u0027 between the two nations.   Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (center) is welcomed by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Ri Kil Song (right) on his arrival at Pyongyang Airport, North Korea, on Wednesday  Beijing is trying to ensure a larger role  in the new round of nuclear diplomacy with PyongyangWang Yi\u0027s visit came days after Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed to work toward the \u0027complete denuclearisation\u0027 of the Korean Peninsula, though they did not mention specific plans or timetables.They also agreed to work toward formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War and push for three-way talks with Washington or four-way talks that also include Beijing to do so. The Koreas can\u0027t officially end the war themselves because South Korea wasn\u0027t a direct signatory to the armistice that stopped the fighting but left the peninsula technically in a state of war.More substantial discussions on the North Korea\u0027s denuclearisation - including what, when and how it would occur - are expected between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, who could meet in May or June. The North\u0027s state-media have not yet commented on Wang\u0027s arrival in Pyongyang.Wang is likely to use his visit to further ensure that Beijing would not be sidelined in the high-stakes discussions surrounding the North. Some South Korean analysts believe Wang would specifically seek Kim\u0027s commitment that the process on formally ending the war would include China.

Kim\u0027s Beijing visit was widely seen as a move to strengthen his leverage ahead of his talks with Trump by re-introducing China as a major player in the global diplomatic push to resolve the nuclear standoff.Analysts say Kim would have asked China, North Korea\u0027s only major ally and main economic lifeline, to soften its enforcement of sanctions aimed at the North. Kim also may have sought Chinese commitments to strongly oppose any military measure the United States might take should his talks with Trump fall apart and the North starts testing missiles again.While the Kim-Trump talks is shaping up to be crucial, there\u0027s still widespread doubt whether Kim will ever agree to entirely abandon his nuclear weapons when he apparently sees them as providing his only guarantee of survival in a region surrounded by enemies.Seoul has said Kim expressed genuine interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons. But North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of \u0027denuclearization\u0027 that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development unless Washington removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan.Kim\u0027s move to re-insert China as a major player in the process has been seen as a sign that the North\u0027s traditional stance essentially remains. Beijing has been calling for a \u0027dual suspension\u0027 - of the North\u0027s nuclear and missile activities and of the large-scale military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/02/01/1AC9DEEE00000514-0-image-m-51_1525220799382.jpg","title":"Hamleys owner control House Fraser shut stores","story":"      Closures: House of Fraser plans to shut a number of its department stores across the UKC.banner has purchased a 51 per cent stake in House of Fraser, which was previously controlled by Chinese group Nanjing Cenbest, which is part of the Sanpower conglomerate. Cenbest, which is part of the Sanpower Group, will remain a significant minority shareholder.

The latest sentence will start after he has finished serving that\u0027He surrounded himself with young teenage boys, usually vulnerable boys, has groomed them by plying them with alcohol, favours and sometimes threats, and has routinely sexually abused them.\u0027He also traded on what he perceived was his notoriety and reputation in the local area.\u0027 His first victim was aged just 10 when Noonan, who was six years older, took him from a care home and indecently assaulted him twice, ordering the boy not to tell anyone.The second victim said he was 16 or 17 when he first met Noonan outside a pizzeria. He told how Noonan threatened him, accusing him of having called him \u0027gay\u0027, before he was beaten by a gang of teens with hockey sticks. He then indecently assaulted the boy on a few occasions, once in a disused shop.A third victim said he was in his early teens in the 2000s when he met Noonan, who molested him on 20 or more occasions. He described how he would spend time driving around with Noonan and other young lads. He would be taken to parties where there was drink and drugs. Noonan would ply them with drink, but not get drunk himself. His victim described being \u0027brainwashed\u0027 into thinking the abuse was normal.The fourth victim was aged in his mid-teens when he met Noonan in the 2000s, agreeing to renovate a pub for him. This victim was said to be completely under Noonan\u0027s spell.At the conclusion of his trial at Manchester Crown Court, Noonan was convicted of eight counts of indecent assault, one of attempted rape, two of inciting a child into sexual activity, one of sexual assault and one of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child.  One of 14 siblings, Noonan became the spokesman for the family following death of his brother Damian, aged 37, in a motorbike accident in the Dominican Republic in 2004, followed by the murder of his brother Dessie in 2005.Dessie and Damian had worked on the door of the Hacienda in the 1980s and were then said to control the supply of drugs at the nightclub.When they died, Dominic Noonan became the boss, or at least he gave the appearance of being the head of the family.A cunning, intelligent inidual, he admitted to being \u0027thoroughly dishonest\u0027 during his trial. He has trumpeted that he is anti-racist and has made much of being able to speak Urdu although, actually, he only knows a few phrases. Over the years, Greater Manchester Police have found little difficulty in obtaining evidence to lock him up for everything from possessing a gun to arson and blackmail.He has spent most of his adult life behind bars. But proving he was a predatory sex offender was another matter. In 2010, a rape charge was dropped. Shortly after he was released from a long prison sentence on licence, he was accused of raping a woman in a hotel room after celebrating his birthday but prosecutors dropped the case.  In 2014 Noonan, jailed for nine-and-a-half years for keeping a revolver under his car bonnet, scaled Manchester\u0027s Big Wheel to protest against plans to recall him to prisonIn 2013, he was cleared of child rape charges after the court heard his accuser had a history of making false complaints. He had been accused of molesting the boy of 15 in a flat in Bloom Street in Manchester city centre.In 2014 Noonan, jailed for nine-and-a-half years for keeping a revolver under his car bonnet, scaled Manchester\u0027s Big Wheel to protest against plans to recall him to prison.Police, paramedics and firefighters had to rescue him in a £30,000 operation as more than 1,000 people gathered to watch in the city centre. Officers said his \u0027outrageous\u0027 actions endangered the lives of tourists - including a petrified three-year-old boy - who were stranded aboard the Ferris wheel in Piccadilly Gardens for two hours.The drama, which began after Noonan was told he had breached his licence conditions, started when he yelled: \u0027I am going to jump.\u0027 in 2016, he was found not guilty of engaging in a sex act in front of a minor, although he was convicted of perverting the course of justice by offering £5,000 to the boy\u0027s family to get the charge dropped. The prosecution alleged that the boy covered his face with a poster as a \u0027vulnerable\u0027 adult man was intimidated into performing a sex act on Noonan in a bedroom, he was also convicted of arson and blackmail connected to a row over an ice cream van, and jailed for eleven years.So, while police have tried many times, it is only now that Noonan has been brought to justice for sex offences."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/02/13/4BC3C78D00000578-0-image-m-12_1525264756142.jpg","title":"Entire 10 000 population volcanic Ambae Island Vanuatu permanently evacuated","story":"    The island was temporarily evacuated last September when the eruption cycle began.

He said there is lots of fine-grained ash, which can affect people\u0027s breathing and respiratory functioning.Other countries including France, New Zealand and Australia provided aid and financial help for the earlier evacuation. Australia on Thursday announced it was providing 300,000 dollars to help with the island\u0027s permanent evacuation, with a focus on the needs of women, children and people with disabilities.

Others have strong cultural associations.\u0027Scott said the Manaro volcano on Ambae island had a large eruption about 400 years ago and has had several smaller eruptions over the past 100 years.

It was against that background that they plotted their own attack upon the school they attended.\u0027In that attack, they intended to shoot and kill other pupils and teachers against whom they held a grievance.\u0027They also, like their heroes, intended to deploy explosives and researched bombing-making techniques to that end.\u0027Mr Greaney said: \u0027They intended a re-enactment of the Columbine High School Massacre although fortunately, in the result, they were stopped before their plans were put into action.\u0027The defendants sat outside the dock, behind their lawyers, in Court 1 of Leeds Crown Court as Mr Greaney began to outline the case. Both sat with their mothers and one was wearing school uniform.Both deny a joint charge of conspiracy to murder relating to a period between December 31 2016 and October 29 2017  The schoolboys allegedly hero-worshipped Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold (left to right)They have also each pleaded not guilty to a charge of intentionally encouraging or assisting an offence and a charge of encouraging or assisting an offence believing it would be committed. The two defendants agreed at some stage no later than late September 2017 to commit murder at the school they attended - but their plan was foiled before being put into action, the jury was told.The older boy, who appeared to be the leader of the two plotters, condoned the Columbine High School Massacre and modelled himself on Harris, it was said.Diary entries revealed he kept deeply offensive Nazi and anti-Semitic views. A hideout made in an abandoned shack at the rear of a Londis Store was discovered which included materials capable of being used in bomb-making.Mr Greaney QC told a jury this cache of items, which included petrol and a bag of screws, provides evidence this plan was real and not fantasy.During April 2017, senior school staff discovered a fake account had been set up on the social networking site Instagram and was being used to post offensive images and comments about teachers.It was discovered one of the defendants had been involved in setting up the account.Both defendants downloaded a file entitled \u0027anarchistcookbook2000\u0027 and, when opened, gave the user access to a 241-page book called \u0027Anarchy Cookbook Version 2000\u0027.That book provides instructions on the manufacture of bombs, including pipe bombs and nail grenades, and explosives, including napalm and nitroglycerin, a jury was told.Mr Greaney QC added: \u0027During May 14 and 15, 2017, {the older defendant} conducted Internet research on the manufacture of bombs.\u0027He accessed sites including \u0027Easy Explosives to Make\u0027 and \u0027Make a Bomb Out of Household Items\u0027.\u0027On May 16, 2017, the defendants had a significant conversation on an instant messaging platform in which the younger defendant said: I can\u0027t be bothered anymore.The older boy replied with \u0027Why not take some others out as well\u0027 before sending another message which read: If you\u0027re gonna kill yourself, shoot up the school.\u0027The conversation occurred not in a vacuum, but rather in the context of adoration of the Columbine killers, the acquisition of a bomb-making manual and the carrying out by {the defendant} of further research to that end, \u0027 added the prosecution.  The pair were arrested in late October 2017 and, during police interview, one of the boys said everything was fantasy, a court heard.The second boy maintained he had initially believed his friend was joking but later he came to believe he did intend a massacre, and thereafter, acted to prevent it taking place, a jury was told.One of the boys is also accused of aggravated burglary on October 21 last year. He is also accused of maliciously wounding a woman on September 4, 2017.The boys, now aged 15, have pleaded not guilty to all the charges and are standing trial at Leeds Crown Court. Neither of the defendants nor the school can be named. The trial, which is likely to last a month, continues. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/13/4BCE426A00000578-5686121-image-a-36_1525349921134.jpg","title":"Kim Jong meets Chinas foreign minister North Korea","story":"    In this image taken from video footage by China\u0027s CCTV via AP Video, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (left) meets North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (right) in Pyongyang, North Korea, today          China\u0027s foreign minister Wang Yi (right) congratulated North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (left) on Thursday on his moves to reduce tensions with South Korea, China said  Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u0027s supreme leader, has met Wang Yi, China\u0027s foreign minister in Pyongyang. Beijing is seeking a role in new round of nuclear diplomacy   More substantial discussions on the North Korea\u0027s denuclearisation are expected to happen between Kim and President Donald Trump who could meet in May or JuneButchered rhino carcass and Stone Age tools reveal early...Tourist is spotted carrying a \u0027dolphin\u0027 over his shoulder as...Chinese laureate\u0027s widow willing to \u0027die at home\u0027 in protestChina orders Qantas to toe the Communist Party line or face...Share this articleThe meeting took place about a month after Kim Jong-un had paid a visit to Beijing and met China\u0027s president Xi Jinping.

The North Korean leader reportedly called the relation between Pyongyang and Beijing \u0027extremely precious\u0027 and vowed to reinforce and develop the \u0027friendly cooperation\u0027 between the two nations.   Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (center) is welcomed by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Ri Kil Song (right) on his arrival at Pyongyang Airport, North Korea, on Wednesday  Beijing is trying to ensure a larger role  in the new round of nuclear diplomacy with PyongyangWang Yi\u0027s visit came days after Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed to work toward the \u0027complete denuclearisation\u0027 of the Korean Peninsula, though they did not mention specific plans or timetables.They also agreed to work toward formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War and push for three-way talks with Washington or four-way talks that also include Beijing to do so. The Koreas can\u0027t officially end the war themselves because South Korea wasn\u0027t a direct signatory to the armistice that stopped the fighting but left the peninsula technically in a state of war.More substantial discussions on the North Korea\u0027s denuclearisation - including what, when and how it would occur - are expected between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, who could meet in May or June. The North\u0027s state-media have not yet commented on Wang\u0027s arrival in Pyongyang.Wang is likely to use his visit to further ensure that Beijing would not be sidelined in the high-stakes discussions surrounding the North. Some South Korean analysts believe Wang would specifically seek Kim\u0027s commitment that the process on formally ending the war would include China.

Kim\u0027s Beijing visit was widely seen as a move to strengthen his leverage ahead of his talks with Trump by re-introducing China as a major player in the global diplomatic push to resolve the nuclear standoff.Analysts say Kim would have asked China, North Korea\u0027s only major ally and main economic lifeline, to soften its enforcement of sanctions aimed at the North. Kim also may have sought Chinese commitments to strongly oppose any military measure the United States might take should his talks with Trump fall apart and the North starts testing missiles again.While the Kim-Trump talks is shaping up to be crucial, there\u0027s still widespread doubt whether Kim will ever agree to entirely abandon his nuclear weapons when he apparently sees them as providing his only guarantee of survival in a region surrounded by enemies.Seoul has said Kim expressed genuine interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons. But North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of \u0027denuclearization\u0027 that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development unless Washington removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan.Kim\u0027s move to re-insert China as a major player in the process has been seen as a sign that the North\u0027s traditional stance essentially remains. Beijing has been calling for a \u0027dual suspension\u0027 - of the North\u0027s nuclear and missile activities and of the large-scale military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/458bf0517b6c23bd5be5ddea08f07eec9754b325/0_1626_2549_1528/master/2549.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=026c949af8c0af35994db809d41906d4","title":"king james bibles classic english text revealed to include work by french scholar","story":"Academic discovers contributions to the translation by Isaac Casaubon, who helped with knotty translation questions despite speaking little EnglishA scholar has discovered that the King James Bible includes work by a previously unsuspected French translator, whose contribution to the quintessentially English work has lain undetected for 400 years.The landmark work, first published in 1611, was drafted by more than 40 translators. But according to Nicholas Hardy from Birmingham University, few documents survive from the drafting and revision stages of the translation and little is known about how the translators worked together.Hardy was consulting a printed copy of the ancient Greek version of the Old Testament, which is held in Oxford’s Bodleian Library, when he noticed that the thousands of handwritten annotations in its margins were in the hand of John Bois, one of the King James Bible’s translators. The annotations’ author had previously been unknown.He then followed a “paper trail” to the British Library in London, where he found correspondence between Bois and the renowned French scholar Isaac Casaubon. The unpublished letters revealed that Bois had asked Casaubon for help translating several passages that he and his colleagues were struggling to complete.Once Hardy identified Casaubon as a translator, he studied the Frenchman’s notebooks, which have been held in the Bodleian since the 1670s, finding records of the conversations Casaubon had with the translator Andrew Downes about other complications in the Bible’s text.“I discovered a series of documents that had been sitting in libraries since they were written, for 400 years basically, but their significance hadn’t been realised,” said Hardy. Casaubon was visiting London at the time of the translation and could “barely speak or write English”, according to Hardy, so he corresponded with the other translators in Latin.“The translators consulted him because they were still dealing with a lot of unresolved problems in the original texts which they were translating from,” said Hardy. “These new sources show us how complex those problems were, and how strongly the translators could disagree with each other about how to solve them. For example, one of the toughest questions they faced was about the relationship between parts of the Old Testament that survived only in Greek and Latin, usually known as the ‘apocryphal’ books, and the parts that survived in Hebrew. Casaubon was there to help the translators deal with issues like this, but they did not always agree with the solutions he put forward.”According to Birmingham University, Hardy’s discovery of the three documents brings the number of known sources associated with the translation of the King James Bible up to seven.The academic, who is writing a book-length study of the King James Bible for Princeton University Press, said the documents “get us as close as we will ever get to hearing the translators in conversation”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccc6534dd4dcb0928726f528030f6cb650f33c1a/0_126_3775_2264/master/3775.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6463d96d9dc0d653ccd90f050b8d8de7","title":"prospect of uk interest rate rise dims as uk service sector struggles","story":"Hotels and restaurants worst hit amid weaker recovery from cold snap than forecastServices firms reported the third lowest level of business activity since the EU referendum in 2016 to defy City economists, who expected a stronger recovery from the cold weather in March.Firms that sell services to consumers were the worst affected, notably hotels and restaurants.

The brightest news came from the construction sector, which saw the largest monthly output rise since November, albeit after an especially sharp decline in March.”Paul Hollingsworth, a senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the weakness of the rebound in April would “do little to assuage fears that the economy has suffered a loss of underlying momentum and makes the chances of a rate hike next week extremely slim”.Threadneedle Street policymakers meet on 10 May to judge the state of the economy and decide whether to increase interest rates for only the second time since the 2008 financial crash.Several members of the central bank’s rate setting committee indicated in the early part of the year that they were ready to increase the cost of borrowing and several mortgage lenders raised the cost of their two-year fixed rates loans in response.However, the likelihood of a rise has receded following a series of weak economic indicators, forcing lenders to revise their outlook.However, it said optimism about the next 12 months had increased. “The balance of companies expecting a rise in business activity over the year ahead reached its highest level since January. This was attributed to forthcoming product launches, new marketing plans and discounting strategies,” it said.

The city I worked in briefly in my youth still had mills towering over its hillsides and tycoon mansions lining Manningham Lane. The centre was a tight group of Victorian palaces and wool warehouses. It could just echo TS Eliot’s assurance, sitting “like a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire”. There were fashionable shops in Darley Street, once the Bond Street of the north, which was jammed with Rolls-Royces.Bradford council’s chief executive, Kersten England, is a woman on a mission. She burns with a determination to pull the city around, and aims “to make Bradford the Shoreditch of Yorkshire”. She declines to join the northern chorus for more grants, subsidies and attention from London. She has given up on competing with her neighbouring rival, booming Leeds. She wants “not to do things, but to help others to do them” – to facilitate the revival of an “alternative Bradford”.Undaunted, England led me through a maze of deserted alleys to her micro-Shoreditch, a subterranean warren of old storage tunnels and caves. Here a local developer, Graham Hall, has bravely invested £2m in craft beer pubs, gin bars, artisanal food outlets and music venues, cluttered with railway junk and industrial antiques. Sunbridgewells is a hipster cliche, but England sees it as ground zero of Bradford’s “creative hub”. She was so proud of it that last year she persuaded Princess Anne – hardly a hipster – to declare it open. The Shoreditch model requires others to flock to Sunbridgewells, but this has yet to happen. Waterstones has converted the old Wool Exchange into what must be its most exotic shop. A few pubs, such as the famous Sparrow, cling to life nearby. The Little Shop of Soaps briefly showed its artisanal face next to Sunbridgewells but is closing “for lack of footfall”, says its owner Tracey Lavelle. Up the road from Rawson Square is David Craig’s Assembly warehouse, host to a group of freelance designers and publishers. Craig reckons the space costs roughly half what it would in suburban Saltaire, and a fifth what it would in Leeds. But he is a pioneer. He admits he was drawn to Bradford by its underdog status and “gritty, do-it-yourself nature”. He and his colleagues “have a passion for the city”, even though only a few live there. As yet they are less a hub than an oasis.  Another champion of the new Bradford, Amir Hussain, is an architect with an expanding practice in the city’s Goitside district. He wants to persuade second- and third-generation Asians to come out of their suburban enclaves into the “centre of the donut”, bringing with them some of the ethnic vitality of the high streets and bazaars visible in the city’s encircling “villages”.  Bradford has long been victim of half a century of crisis in British town planning. Already in the 1970s the local council was committing suicide. As if to eradicate its past as capital of the wool trade, it began the demolition of its Victorian core and drove a road through the wreckage. Sites were cleared for blocks of what the Pevsner guide calls “mind-numbing banality”.  In the 1980s the city toyed with Thatcherism under the leadership of Eric Pickles. A third of people on the council payroll were sacked, some 9,000 jobs, with no compensating upturn in private employment. Tory Whitehall gave the city a meagre reward in the form of a photography museum and a tax office. One failed – its photographs were carted off to London’s V\u0026ampA – and the other is closing. Dispersal was the last thing central Bradford wanted. The council answered with a killer punch of its own. It cleared a 12-acre swathe of land behind the city hall for a giant, introverted shopping mall, Broadway. When it opened a few years ago, it killed all other retail activity in the city centre like a plague. I have never seen such commercial devastation caused by a single planning decision. It is hard not to warm to the determination of England and her team. Yorkshire cities are notoriously bad neighbours, and Bradford’s rivalry with Leeds, 10 miles away, is the stuff of history. But the city planner, Bhupinder Dev, knows his future lies in finding a relationship with Leeds. The contrast is almost obscene. Leeds seems rich. It has drawn big government investments in universities and hospitals. Towers of luxury flats line the old canal. Smart shops define the Headrow. Council leader Judith Blake told me her chief challenge was “an acute shortage of skilled labour”. To her, Bradford’s value to Leeds was almost humiliating – its unemployment rate and its output of school leavers.  Dev and England want Bradford to be “alternative” and creative. “We simply must make central Bradford a place in which people want to live, not from which they are desperate to move,” says Dev. Successful Asians, he says, are drifting away to Pudsey on the Leeds road to avoid a Bradford postcode.  Bradford has tried this before. Across the centre of town is Little Germany, a neighbourhood of handsome sandstone warehouses next to the cathedral. It was given a conservation makeover 10 years ago, and is home to the Bradford Playhouse and a scatter of studios and galleries. A large portrait of the city’s favourite son David Hockney adorns a building exterior. But Little Germany lacks critical mass and residents are wary of the place.  While music venues and arts festivals draw audiences, they do not draw residents. Somehow life must be breathed into dead Victorian streets and old mills. The spirit that once revived San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury, Manhattan’s Greenwich Village and the ever-cited Shoreditch must be found somewhere. These places recovered by sucking activity and enterprise from adjacent areas of wealth. Bradford must do that from Leeds.  The ShoreditchDetroit model requires extreme measures. It requires unused buildings to be released by their owners into a “down and out” economy. They must gradually attract artists, designers and writers, people who appear to find inspiration in dereliction. They in turn hand over to digital entrepreneurs and other “creatives”. Bradford may not be as desperate as Detroit, but the longer it sits and hopes, the more its centre will depopulate and deteriorate.  The Yorkshire economy has been tortoise to the hare of Manchester’s northern powerhouse. It has depended on the employment hotspots of Leeds and Sheffield, on prosperous farming and on tourism to York, Harrogate and the Dales. This has left “cold spots” in the old mining and mill towns, Barnsley, Rotherham, Wakefield and Huddersfield. The pits and the looms have disappeared and nothing has taken their place.  Bradford is the most challenging by far. It is lucky to have in England, her council leader, Susan Hinchliffe, and Leeds’s Judith Blake, leaders of stature and intelligence, who seem to get the point of Yorkshire’s future. They are well-placed to capitalise on a promised new dawn in Yorkshire politics, with Labour MP Dan Jarvis who will run for mayor of South Yorkshire. He is rumoured to have his eye on becoming mayor of all Yorkshire, of “God’s own county”. He might start by declaring Bradford “God’s own Shoreditch”.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f5d6ce10641d6f223580c23c9c4588cb486fdd6/0_147_5183_3110/master/5183.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2473bfb527ba8b72a7e1e452697dbfaa","title":"choice inequality education system social segregation","story":"In Britain, social segregation starts early, with a few given the tools to succeed while the rest are abandonedWhat price can you put on a child’s education? It depends on who that child is. New figures show the average fee for attending a top private school has now risen above £17,000 a year for the first time. In contrast, a child attending a state school in England can expect to have £4,000 to £6,000 spent on them, depending on location and additional allowances. This would be worrying in any circumstances but when we have crumbling and cramped state schools, it feels almost grotesque. While some children enjoy drama halls and swimming pools, others are trying to learn surrounded by leaks, mould and vermin.Inequality in education is not a new phenomenon. Even before vast underfunding set in, we had one of the most unequal school systems in the developed world. Private schools, remarkably, still retain charitable status, a gift from the taxpayer for retaining privilege. (The chair of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, which represents most of Britain’s leading public schools, once compared making greater links between private and state schools as a condition of their tax break to the ordeal of forced marriage.) There is also rampant inequality even within the state sector, with middle-class offspring more likely to get a better deal from a comprehensive.With aching predictability, austerity measures have made this situation worse. Last year, an analysis of Department for Education data revealed that schools with the highest numbers of pupils on free school meals are facing the deepest funding cuts. Ministers have chosen to make “savings” predominantly off the back of low-income pupils in an education system that was already stacked against them.Instead of investing in existing state schools, the government has wasted money on vanity projects. Since the Conservatives’ free schools policy was introduced in 2010, it’s pushed funding from other pupils, often paying way over the odds for the land and even erting £96m to academy budgets originally intended for improving in-need comprehensives.How has this plan worked out? This month, Plymouth studio school announced it would be the latest free school to close, only a couple of days after the Isle of Wight studio school said it would do the same due to lack of demand. The National Education Union (NEU) calculates that the latest closures bring the total to 66 new schools launched under the government’s flagship policy that have closed, partially closed or failed to open at all. “Free school” is a misnomer: while teachers are running out of paper for their classrooms, this ideological failure has cost the education budget almost £150m.In a 2016 league table of all measures of poverty, the UK did rather better compared with other nations. The study, also by Unicef, ranked the UK joint-14th out of 35 rich nations. This was just above the US, but well below many European countries, notably Denmark, Finland and Norway. On some specific measures the UK did less well, notably education, where it\u0026nbspranked 25th\u0026nbspout of 39 countries, and health, where it was 19th out of 35.In the\u0026nbsplatest official comparison\u0026nbspof poverty across the 28 countries in the European Union, the UK ranked 15th. This was some way behind the Czech Republic, Sweden and the Netherlands but ahead of Ireland, Spain and Italy. The European figures confirmed the JRF’s observation that the number of people at risk of poverty in the UK has risen since 2008.Bear in mind also that free schools predominantly serve wealthier communities. Free schools and academies, just like grammar schools, educate significantly fewer children in receipt of free school meals (in fact, half of all free school meal children are educated in just a fifth of all schools). The ideology of “choice”, be it private or free school, has always been code for “inequality”.It’s an inequality that feels particularly desperate right now. Britain as a whole is becoming more and more ided, as the wealthiest iniduals see their fortunes surge by hundreds of billions, while food banks are handing out a record number of parcels. Soaring child poverty is the unforgiving result of this: schoolchildren left to sleep on cardboard boxes before going to class the next morning malnourished, tiny bodies, stuffing their pockets with food at school, or taking scraps from the school bins, because their parents can’t afford a hot meal at home. Education this week reported that deprivation has reached such a level that teachers are helping parents pay for underwear, a mattress, and even non-uniform clothes for weekends “so they can feel normal”.It is well-established that unequal societies create damage not only for the poorest but also for the whole population. The Harvard professor Ichiro Kawachi describes inequality as a “social pollutant” – a rot that breeds anything from mental health problems and loss of community to reduced wellbeing.Education – that supposed leveller and bastion of opportunity – far from providing a route to a better life in this country, is only replicating this inequality. Whether it’s tax breaks for private schools, futile free schools, or underfunded comprehensives, we are sleepwalking into an ever deepening class system – one in which a select few are given the tools to excel, and the rest are abandoned to the scraps. A time in which school inequality is deepening against a backdrop of rocketing child poverty may feel a hopeless point for progress but really, it should be a call to arms. It is not radical to say children from low-income families matter just as much as those born, on the roll of the dice, to advantage. Well-funded schools are the bedrock for a decent future – not just for some kids but for all of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a9f0c34a41fb8ddb8b40057ab68bcb4687edf0/0_91_2745_1647/master/2745.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03b33638381ee5ec41ccc4970759f8b8","title":"harry meghan pay as you go wedding commoners royal wedding","story":"Oh, how the monarchy is modernising! Look at lovely, jokey Harry with his openness about mental health and his glowing fiancee, who astonishingly has had a life, is not a dumb blonde and says things about female independence. Oh, how they have moved on, this new generation of royals. They are just like us, after all.Except they are not. So the latest news about the commoners invited to the royal wedding is really stunning in its declaration of who’s who and what’s what. Kensington Palace (probably using the retch-inducing phrase “reach out”) announced earlier this year that Meghan and Harry were going “to allow members of the public to join in their celebration”. Very special people representing “youth” and “ersity” and – whisper it quietly – poor people would be allowed inside the perimeter of Windsor Castle. This is not just a wedding, remember, this is an attempt to build a bridge between high society and well … society.Twelve-hundred hand-picked “ordinary” people, many from charities that the royals support, will be let into the castle’s grounds. They will be there for hours and hours, and yet, it seems, they will not get so much as a vol-au-vent. Those who work with deprived and alienated people have been advised in letters from lord lieutenants “to bring a picnic lunch as it will not be possible to buy food and drink on site”. What? What kind of invite is that?It’s one that absolutely makes clear what is happening. That’s what. It never had anything to do with altruism. These ordinary people will effectively be extras for the TV coverage. They’ll make up a crowd that will be beamed around the world. The royals’ net wealth is estimated at around £400m – but now let us bow down before our rulers and hope that a garage sandwich will tide us over. Oh, I know it is not a good time to be a republican but quite honestly it never is. No one can begrudge the Queen, no one can’t admire the loveliness of Meghan, and on it goes. Only that kind of thinking is how this fountainhead of inequality is always made palatable.I once refused to go to a wedding because there was a pay bar as well as one of those irritating wedding lists. So I am not a great one for a pay-as-you-go celebrations. I can’t see it as anything other than meanness. Have a party or don’t. These occasions are actually very boring for spectators: hours of waiting around for a fleeting glimpse of a gloved hand as it speeds past. I was in the cathedral for Diana’s funeral, and on the way there we went past the crowds who had been sleeping in the street overnight. Weirdly, I was at Windsor for Harry’s father’s “low-key” wedding to Camilla, hoping, I suppose, for the ghost of Diana to appear. The crowds were quite sparse but had their flags to wave. What makes people wait for hours to do this, I remember asking a bored policeman. “We call them cat-stranglers,” he said. I didn’t know what that meant. “Women so mad they strangle their own cats,” he informed me.Now, though, the royalist media will go into overdrive and there will be a lot of reverential dross about protocol and etiquette. Debrett’s advises at least six canapes per guest before a wedding lunch. Harry and Meghan’s 600 actual guests will get the works, but the people chosen because they serve the most vulnerable in their communities will be left milling about for hours and are now Googling Windsor for the nearest supermarkets.As a metaphor for inclusivity royal-style, though, it’s all perfect, isn’t it? Do please come and gawp and cheer, but bring your own sandwiches. The meanness of the super-rich is truly something to behold. Twenty-one-year-old Saeed Atcha told the  that the news made him wonder if he should go to a nearby McDonald’s, but he wasn’t sure whether he’d be allowed to bring in a filet meal. He set up a magazine in Bolton after the 2011 riots and talked of the bemusement of some of the disadvantaged people his charity helps that the royals will scarcely offer invitees a drink. “It’s unfathomable,” he said. Not really, it’s the monarchy. Same as it ever was."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e3ac94788b76ef845085c533a4103107dcf9955/0_297_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f4106f3eb675d7585d282c917a0e617","title":"new mothers loneliness services parent child","story":"It is the strange lot of young mothers to be never alone, but often lonely. You may have a baby stuck limpet-like to your breast, hip or lap, but for many women, particularly those heroic superbeings we call single mothers, loneliness stalks the days like a tiger.Of course they are. When you’re earning just £20.70 a week in child benefit when you have to sit in a dark room every couple of hours in order to tempt some food into an overstimulated child when your family are at work when you are still knitting your body back together after childbirth when your friends don’t know how to change a nappy and you can’t afford a babysitter when your partner is too tired to talk to you after a day at work when you’re too shy to walk up to pram-pushing strangers in the street when a place at nursery costs as much as your rent when the local library has closed down when you’ve had no sleep and have lost your nerve – of course you stay at home. Of course you get lonely.Yet it feels somehow taboo to admit to loneliness when you’re in the constant company of your own child. Mothers are somehow assumed to need no more stimulation than to stare adoringly into the wet eyes of their baby from birth: the amusement of a hiccup or an unexpected mid-air wee should be substitute enough for adult conversation the feel of a chubby hand around your finger should wipe away any interest in your friends, sharing anecdotes, going on holiday, resting your head on another person’s shoulder, talking about your day …Even for mothers, like me, who have approached child-rearing like the fermentation of a strong cheese, the hallmarks of loneliness still catch in my throat. The small plate of biscuits, drying out on a side table at 9am in desperate anticipation of your one visitor, who isn’t coming until 5pm when they knock off work the too-long chats with the woman at the shop who politely asked your child’s age – and is the only person you’ve spoken to all day who didn’t have dribble on their chin. You can smell a new mother’s hunger for company like the tang of vinegar: a little too strong, a little too sour.How do you solve a problem like maternal loneliness? Well, we could stop making it financially prohibitive to continue the human race in this, one of the wealthiest countries in the world. The government could take some of that money we pour into defence every year and use it to subsidise nurseries, fund children’s centres, and pay a maternal allowance that a family could actually live on. In Germany parents get €194 a month – over £170 – in benefit for the first two children parents can take leave from work while being able to return to a guaranteed job for up to three years and childcare is better subsidised. In Britain, we would rather give tax breaks to millionaires than pay mothers to create a healthy nation.We could also do more to encourage women to build a support network before having a baby if women had more paid time off, they could leave work more than a few days before giving birth, and therefore have time to adjust. That way they could meet other mothers-to-be in their area before they are tied to a crying, feeding dependent 24 hours a day. We could offer longer prenatal courses on the NHS, protect and expand NHS breastfeeding services, and create more children’s centres and forest schools. We could do the work early, rather than throwing new mothers to the wolves.Half the women surveyed by the National Childbirth Trust last year reported that they experienced mental health or emotional difficulties at some time during pregnancy or in the year after birth. I would bet my spit-soaked shoulder that much of that is due, in part at least, to loneliness. Motherhood can be lonely for everyone, of course – but for the millions of British women on low or no incomes, living alone, trying to survive off food banks and uncertain benefits, without a job to return to or a support network to fall back on, the situation can appear desperate.These women are growing our future they have pushed a nation out of their bodies and into the world. It is now the government’s responsibility to nurture, shape and support that nation. If we have money for war, Brexit, business and a royal family, then we really should be able to find it for mums."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53fb64621bf2fe69a32be2b6f9ce7620999323c2/0_265_5517_3310/master/5517.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62dcef7f5fa8c8351c64d7adfcae0dfc","title":"recovering alcoholic minimum booze pricing scotland poverty drink","story":"Nothing fires up we Scots quite like someone threatening to lengthen our life expectancy. And now, thanks to legislation that puts a floor on the price of alcohol, many of us have a reason to get upset.On Tuesday, Scotland became the first country in the world to introduce a minimum price on alcohol. After six years of public debate (and legal challenges from our benevolent drinks lobby), the new legislation finally came into effect. Unsurprisingly, it has ided opinion.Yet there remains an elusive force at play in the public conversation about alcohol. Namely, the fact that so many of us who drink too much are either unaware of it or are in some form of denial.Being a recovered alcoholic, this tendency towards some form of self-deception – whether rounding down how many glasses of wine you had with dinner or flat-out lying about how much money you blew on a night out – is something I can identify with. We tend to downplay or underestimate both how much we drink and the impact it has on our finances and mental health – which is why facts are useful when creating policies that are designed to tackle the issue. And, like many of the hard drinkers up in arms about minimum pricing, the facts clearly speak for themselves.Sadly, many critics of the policy are focused on the cost to them personally. But even then, as with the uproar when producers of Irn Bru were mandated to stop putting our body weight in sugar into their drinks, or when smokers were unceremoniously chucked out on the street for a few minutes to smoke their cigarettes, or when a certain teacake manufacturer was boycotted for not being Scottish enough, the impact of minimum pricing has been hysterically overstated.If people drink within the recommended guidelines, then the cost is nothing to worry about. It’s only when you buy large volumes of alcohol that the financial burden begins to accumulate. You’ll hear people claim, with a straight face: “This won’t stop hardcore drinkers, but it will stop me.” Which is to miss the point entirely.Research conducted by the University of Sheffield in 2016 estimated that the minimum price of 50p per unit (what we now have in Scotland) could cut alcohol related deaths by 60 in the first year and 120 by year 20 of the policy. Hospital admissions could fall by 1,300 in the first year and 2,000 by year 20. The financial saving from harm reduction could be as much as £942m per year.Sceptics claim the measure won’t deter many alcoholics, implying that something already exists that is capable of such a feat. As someone who falls squarely into that alcoholic category, I can tell you that the threat of financial ruin – among other things – certainly gave me pause for thought.We don’t throw out the rules of the road because some people choose not to abide by them. This is about policy that influences human behaviour over a long period. This is about looking beyond the horizon line of our current culture of excess, to a society where getting paralytic is no longer regarded as a harmless rite of passage.When a fast car slows down at a crossing, the driver isn’t stopping simply because of the red light. They stop due to a combination of forces. A foot on a brake pedal, the friction of the road on the tyres as well as a speed limit. We also have various cultural factors that exert a certain gravity over a motorist’s thinking and behaviour as well, like the fear of getting points on a licence for using a phone or drink-driving.Of course, these rules will never eliminate dangerous driving, and many safe drivers will inevitably feel put-out, believing such rules should not apply to them, but the cumulative effect of all these factors is safer roads for everyone.Minimum pricing exerts an additional drag-force over a certain type of drinker, making it that bit less easy to misuse alcohol. It’s that simple. It won’t solve every drink-related problem, just as airbags, seatbelts and baby seats don’t save everyone from road accidents, but as part of a combination of measures, minimum pricing will play a significant part in tackling alcohol misuse.If it only leads to some people drinking a little less, the cumulative impact of a moderate reduction, both at the level of the inidual and society, could be massive.The only question left for the Scottish government is what they intend to do about the root cause of so much alcoholism: poverty.• Darren McGarvey is author of Poverty Safari"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c000486b408bbd72cecbfd26156b41679e389eb/0_238_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=259b87f7773012d1473735cedb607003","title":"state secret kidnaps children herefordshire council","story":"Imagine you’re a single mother. You get injured in a car accident, and a kind friend offers to look after your two young boys while you’re in\u0026nbsphospital. You accept with relief. Three weeks later, when you get home, you’re still a bit shaky, so your friend suggests it might be best if she has the boys for another few days. You are unsure, but she is persuasive. First thing on Friday you send a text saying you will pick them up from school. A few hours later – you’ve been awaiting her reply, slightly puzzled at the delay – a text\u0026nbsppings back: they are really looking forward to the fun weekend she has planned. How about revisiting the situation on Monday?With mounting unease and some anger you race over and tell her the kids are coming home with you. You are met with a smiling refusal. Until she feels that you are well enough, she explains calmly, they are staying with her. Then she bundles them into her car and heads off to a holiday camp. Presumably at this point you would call the police. Given that there are laws in this country about kidnap, you would get your children back pronto, and your “friend” would be in serious trouble.Kidnap is not a crime typically associated with Britain. But it is happening, right now, and the local authorities involved don’t want you to know. High court judge Mr\u0026nbspJustice Keehan, in a scathing judgment earlier this year at Nottingham family court, revealed that at least 16 children have been “wrongly and abusively” looked after by Herefordshire council, under something called a section 20 arrangement, for “wholly inappropriate” periods of time. For one boy, that was the first nine years of his life after he was born to his 14-year-old mother. For another boy it was eight years, from the age of eight to 16, despite his mother on several occasions withdrawing her consent. Shockingly, at the time of the judgment, 14 children were still being wrongfully looked after by Herefordshire on section 20 arrangements, despite the local authority knowing full well the judge’s displeasure.These are not court orders. They must be a voluntary agreement, and in legal terms they precisely mirror the situation where the single parent consented (at first) to her friend looking after her boys. For a section 20 to be legal, social workers must be certain they have a parent’s informed consent to their child being accommodated by the state. And a parent can withdraw consent at any time, because they keep full parental responsibility. If Mum or Dad wants to turn up at a foster carer’s house at midnight without notice and take their child home, they can. No ifs, no buts. But many parents say social workers threaten that if they do, it will mean a trip to court for a care order. There is no surer way to scare the living daylights out of a parent. And so frightened acquiescence – not the same as consent – tends to be the result.The sheer scale of the section 20 abuses revealed in Keehan’s judgment dwarfs many other egregious instances of its misuse that have been detailed in a slew of judgments published by outraged judges over the past few years. Given the substantial publicity these judicial criticismshave had in the social work and legal press, it is difficult to see how social workers in good faith can plead ignorance of the law. The only alternative is that they are recklessly, even deliberately, choosing to flout it. Despite the fact that one boy’s mother withdrew her consent to section 20 accommodation, Herefordshire’s children’s services deliberately chose not to follow the council’s legal officers’ repeated advice that a care order should be sought if it was thought the boy should remain in foster care.In the case of the boy who was on a section 20 for the first nine years of his life, the judge observed that repeated recommendations made by his independent reviewing officer that his case should be brought before a court were ignored by those above her. Added to this miserable litany of failure, Herefordshire council also accepted that it had “not respected” his 14-year-old mother’s human rights as a vulnerable child herself: it’s doubtful, at the age she gave birth, whether she could have given informed consent. Grasping this surely shouldn’t require a forensic understanding of children’s rights: basic common sense would do.The poet Lemn Sissay recently agreed to accept a compensation package from Wigan council for the abuses he suffered as a child while in its care. Despite his\u0026nbspmother writing letters begging the council to return her baby once she was better able to look after him, he would not be reunited with her until he was in\u0026nbsphis late 20s. That was years ago, but abuses of power\u0026nbspare\u0026nbspstill continuing today.Social workers must stop acting as if they are above the law. In reporting on family cases, I have observed the most extraordinary sense of entitlement and arrogance both in court hearings and in email communications when attempting to investigate and highlight poor and unlawful practice. There is no humility. There is instead a knee-jerk opposition to anyone presuming to want to hold a local authority publicly to account. Given\u0026nbspthat family cases are heard in private, if\u0026nbspthe judge had not rejected the council’s plea to keep its identity secret, nobody would ever have known about the longstanding and outrageous failings of Herefordshire’s social work team. Why, just because the state is the “corporate parent”, should it usually get a free pass on scrutiny and accountability?Kidnapping children is wrong, whoever does it. When\u0026nbspit is the state, which then argues for its transgressions to remain secret in the family courts, it is terrifying. There are growing calls for these courts to lose the privilege of privacy that child protection professionals have benefited from for so long – because how many more human rights abuses are being hidden from view when judges opt not to publish judgments, and when journalists who go to family courts are not allowed report what they see?• Louise Tickle is a freelance journalist who writes on education, social affairs and family law"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a52041260a0046727807aada6d9c13016fbc9821/0_6_3248_1949/master/3248.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2175cb92119da0778d56bf483d10108","title":"tech love rightwing game facebook dating app","story":"Mark Zuckerberg has announced that Facebook is working on new dating features. The news will be received as more evidence that we risk moving into a future dystopia in which all interactions are mapped and configured by a single, all-powerful platform. Yet there is something more urgent that ought to concern us about the ways love is being transformed by technology: its link to contemporary political trends that favour anti-progressive identity politics.The mainstream media recently became aware of the bizarre hook-up site Trump.dating when it accidentally\u0026nbspused a convicted sex offender in its ad campaign. What should concern us about such sites, which have\u0026nbspa surprising history,\u0026nbspis not this particular faux pas, but the fact that they embody a new trend uniting technology, love and politics – a trend that is serving the right.In his Senate hearing regarding Cambridge Analytica, Zuckerberg responded to some grumpy Republicans by claiming that Silicon Valley is such an “extremely leftwing place” that its politics might need to be tempered to avoid bias. Many people in and around tech circles labour under this illusion. But whatever party the tech giants align themselves with, the new technologies emerging in social media, AI, VR and videogaming all seem to serve rightwing agendas far more easily than progressive ones. The example of new technologies of love is a case in point.The idea of pairing up lovers with shared interests (from the elitist to the bizarre) is nothing new, and some have even tried to\u0026nbsprecover the process for progressive culture.\u0026nbspWhat is new is the political quality of such match-ups, which indicates that the long history of matching lovers and friends who share similar identities may have been a rather dangerous path to start down.Now,\u0026nbspfar-right agitators mine the data from OKCupid\u0026nbspin order to justify eugenics on the basis that that data shows we only like people who are like us. Right-leaning intellectuals meet on the Atlasphere, a dating site based on the works of Ayn Rand. Importantly, it is not just the choices of the users but the technology itself that is structured to encourage this logic.The idea that attraction is based on seeing the other person as a reflection of the user is visible not only in human-human relationships mediated by technology but in our relationships with virtual persons. A variety of pop-cultural artefacts, from\u0026nbspBlack Mirror\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspBlade Runner 2049, warn that the robot lovers of the future may do nothing more than narcissistically affirm the user. This, however, is less a prediction of the future than a description of where we already are. AI mobile applications such as\u0026nbspReplika\u0026nbsp(which “matches your personality and becomes your best friend”) learn from your own data and inputs to tell you precisely what you want to hear. The technology – while presenting itself as innocent and apolitical – is based on the logic of identity politics: the ultimate friend or lover is just like you, and affirms who you are.Alongside this, forthcoming “smart condoms” such as the\u0026nbspi.Con\u0026nbspendorse a bro-culture of sexual “prowess”, affirming the activity of the male lover by syncing their sexual performance statistics with their smartphones. Such patterns are related to a sinister trend in tech culture that aims at the “gamification” of love, with features such as “Tinder closer” supporting the idea that women themselves can be played like a game. The same patterns can be seen in the VR world of\u0026nbspvideogames such as Summer Lesson\u0026nbspand in virtual girlfriend mobile gaming, where the user learns to treat relationships as a set of missions to complete.Such trends course through new technologies and endorse a model of relationships that leans towards a dangerous politics in at least two ways. First, it encourages the grouping of people on the basis of shared identity (the political implications of which are now visible). Second, it encourages the gamification of relationships so that the element of otherness in the lover or friend is replaced by a celebration of the mastery of the user.These concerning futures will intensify when the logic of Facebook formally infiltrates the sphere of love. Even if it remains to be seen what the app will look like, its logic will be to connect people on the basis of identity. It will also further gamify love, and Facebook commented that the app will allow users to select something from the profile of another to start a conversation about, creating a kind of multiple-choice gaming challenge akin to virtual dating simulators.What this all shows us is that what we are seeing in the politics of tech dating is not just the right wing making effective use of new technologies but a bias in favour of such politics in the technology itself.In short, these new phenomena – which affect what we look for in both humans and robots (as lovers and as friends) – seem geared towards homogenising relationships so that lovers either give us what we want, mirror our own identities, or both.Love is a political force, and it always has been. In the 1960s it was the left wing that seemed to recognise this, deploying love and pleasure for a political agenda of liberty and egalitarianism. Today, it is the right that seems to be using love to political ends. Supporters of progressive politics need to combat this trend by advocating a form of friendship and love – and developing technology to match it – that is not based on connecting us only to those who share or mirror our identities and confirm our mastery but that allows us to engage with – and desire – people or robots who are different to ourselves, and who challenge us.• Alfie Bown is the author of The Playstation Dreamworld, a philosophy of games and politics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d44792164946af539f8e834cbc38bb80abea549/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9946e35183a6ed1d54bad0ea3b354b3d","title":"lean on pete review horse wild west andrew haigh","story":"A troubled teenager and his beloved old racehorse take to the big country in 45 Years director Andrew Haigh’s poignant adaptation of Willy Vlautin’s novel• Sign up for Film Today and get our film team’s highlights of the dayAndrew Haigh’s sad and lovely new film Lean on Pete is adapted by him from the 2010 novel by American author and alt.country musician Willy Vlautin. It’s got the wonderfully easy, unforced naturalism and calm that distinguished his last two films, Weekend (2011) and 45 Years (2015). Things are taken mostly at a walking pace, a measured, controlled tempo, like someone carefully leading an injured horse. That doesn’t mean to say there aren’t some dramatic and violent moments, including a fateful highway incident, fabricated brilliantly but unobtrusively with digital effects, that had me clasp both hands over my mouth in shock.A lonely teenage boy, Charlie (Charlie Plummer) finds himself one summer in a dilapidated house in Portland, Oregon, having been uprooted from his Washington state hometown, where despite his poor background he had been a good student and promising track star. He’s right back to square one now, and the move evidently has something to do with a broken home. His mom is no longer in the picture and his handsome wastrel of a dad, Ray (Travis Fimmel), is a shiftless guy who brings home a different woman every night. Charlie finds transient work at a nearby racecourse, working for a seedy and unscrupulous horse trainer called Del (Steve Buscemi) who is too bad tempered and cynical to be even an ironic father figure.Charlie is entranced by the excitement and exotic rituals of horse training he befriends Del’s jockey, Bonnie (Chloë Sevigny), and mutely sympathises with her stoic complaints about this corrupt and misogynistic scene. Both Bonnie and Del are amused and yet worried about Charlie becoming so infatuated by a world that can only end for him in the heartbreak and failure they see in their own lives.And Charlie finds himself falling for Del’s sweet-natured and biddable racehorse Lean on Pete. This equable beast is very good for teaching newbies like Charlie – Del brutally calls him a “pussy”. But he is also, ominously, getting slower. Losers like Lean on Pete get sold to horseflesh dealers in Mexico, a fate that doesn’t need to be spelled out. And when Pete becomes injured one afternoon – Charlie abbreviates his name in a way that poignantly emphasises reliability and strength – horse and boy become runaways.The movie takes us across some classic American landscape but it isn’t quite in the tradition of Larry McMurtry or Cormac McCarthy – nor is it like, for example, Chloé Zhao’s recent film The Rider. Importantly, Charlie can’t and won’t ride Lean on Pete. In fact, the theme of the poverty-stricken youngster finding friendship, love and transcendent dignity in the company of a martyred animal is part of a different tradition – the British social realist line stretching from Ken Loach’s Kes to Clio Barnard’s The Selfish Giant. In some ways, the British film-maker Haigh has exported this style to the American West. Lean on Pete has an alt.socialrealist twang. But where his movie departs from that style is in the construction of narrative, and the unexpected way in which the relationship of horse and boy is perhaps not as central and dominant as we might otherwise expect. The meaning and presence of Lean on Pete is mysterious. I found myself thinking about the donkey in Robert Bresson’s Au Hasard Balthazar (1966).Haigh has a masterly way with mood and moment, with the play of light on a scene, and with a robust shift from fierce sunshine to sombre night-time. Everything looks scuffed, worn, broken down perhaps the only things that are cared for are the furniture and fittings of the diners that Del and Charlie show up in. Del’s horses are trained by being made to walk in a circle attached to a rotating maypole contraption that looks ironically like one of the rides at the tatty old fairground races where Lean on Pete usually runs.Plummer gives an excellent performance: watchful, sensitive, delicate and yet possessed of a survivor’s impassive quality. Fimmel is also very good in a role that is perhaps smaller than I expected. Buscemi is as robust and confident as ever and Steve Zahn is also strong in a small role as a homeless alcoholic guy. My only slight reservation is that Lean on Pete, though running to an affecting conclusion, maybe doesn’t deliver the final sting or narrative turn that marked out his previous film, 45 Years. Yet perhaps its simplicity and plainness is the whole point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/855eef761844d28ccaa14b2d0ded894fd46ac057/47_0_1407_844/master/1407.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89de4d030a66c10e0c5318e076535712","title":"why polish gangster films on steroids are making it big at the british box office","story":"With titles such as Pitbull and Mafia Women, violent Polish-language thrillers are proving a cult success – some even denting the UK top 10. But can they win over mainstream audiences?• Sign up for Film Today and get our film team’s highlights of the dayIt is a late Saturday afternoon in Walthamstow, north-east London, and business is slow at the Empire cinema, as it usually is on hot days. Nevertheless, 13 people have chosen a brutal thriller over an extra few hours in the sun. Pitbull: Last Dog, which opened the previous weekend on 279 screens, will have escaped the attention of most cinemagoers. It’s certainly more stomach-churning than the average multiplex fare. One woman has her throat slashed in the first five minutes another is placed under a carpet and then beaten violently with belts by a gang of thugs. A dead man is shot in the mouth at point-blank range, while a gangster pouring acid on a corpse tells his cohort charmingly: “If you make it without puking, I’ll buy you a whore.”Pitbull: Ostatni pies (Pitbull: Last Dog is the latest in a run of films to have dented the UK box office top 10 despite being marketed exclusively at the Polish community. (At the time of writing it has taken around £340,000.) This year has already brought one hit, Kobiety mafii (Mafia Women), which took almost £900,000 in the UK and Ireland. Last year, the grisly 18-rated medical drama Botoks amassed £1.06m, making it not only the third highest-grossing foreign-language release of 2017 (after Park Chan-wook’s The Handmaiden and the Bollywood hit Raees) but the most successful Polish film ever in the UK.Like Bollywood, Polish cinema has flourished in UK multiplexes rather than arthouses, without any help from the British media. It is only partly true to say that the mainstream press has ignored these releases what’s more significant is that its attention and approval were never sought in the first place. With Polish now the second most commonly spoken language in England, English-speaking viewers are not part of this particular success story.The audience members I talk to after Pitbull: Last Dog are both Polish, though neither is especially impressed by what they have just seen. “It’s not as good as the other ones,” says Tomasz, a 40-year-old draughtsman and fan of the two previous Pitbull instalments. “This one is softer, more American. In Polish, we would say grubymi nićmi szyte – ‘stitched with a thick thread’. It hangs together, but only just.” Maciej, a 41-year-old veterinary surgeon, hasn’t seen a Polish film in a cinema since coming to live in the UK 12 years ago. “It was like it was on steroids,” he laughs. “It just showed all the different ways you could kill someone. I couldn’t follow what was going on.” Did it reflect anything about Polish life or culture? “I hope not. If it’s like that, I don’t want to go back.”Awareness of these movies is raised largely through social media and websites, and by the hoopla surrounding the initial premieres back in Poland (Pitbull: Last Dog was released there a month ago and enjoyed the second-biggest opening weekend of any native film this year). But what are Polish viewers here getting from these movies that they can’t get from the mainstream US equivalents? “There’s a certain mix of humour and toughness and a real eastern European vibe which Polish audiences like,” says Joanna Michalec, director of Phoenix Productions, the leading international distributor of Polish films. “I think they also like seeing Poland in a movie, and what’s important is they can go to a normal multiplex and see these films in Polish. That means a lot.”The mainstay of Polish cinema is director Patryk Vega, a Guy Ritchie-style figure responsible for every gory, high-octane success to date with the exception of the latest Pitbull. But not all of Phoenix’s films are violent. It also does a roaring trade in romantic comedies: Narzeczony na Niby (Pretend Fiance) is about to open, while the company had a hit two years ago with Planeta Singli (Planet Single), a lively Richard Curtis-style romcom centred on a dating app. Its Slovenian director, Mitja Okorn, currently lives in Los Angeles and recently finished making Life in a Year with Cara Delevingne and Jaden Smith for Will Smith’s Overbrook Entertainment.In June 2016, I attended a press screening of Planet Single introduced by Okorn, although it is unusual for non-arthouse Polish films to be shown to the press. “I was happy with the UK release, but I always want more,” he says now. “What I wanted was a bigger screening, a premiere where we could get even more UK opinion-makers and journalists to see the film. And that’s how we could slowly build a non-Polish UK audience that would become fans of good Polish cinema. For that to work, the distributors of Polish films would also need to be careful which movies they are distributing. The way it is now, they distribute everything – good, bad and extremely bad. Polish people confuse successful with good.”Can Polish cinema draw English-speaking audiences – and does that even matter? “Absolutely it matters,” says Sweeney. “It’s an untapped market that we’re trying to get into. We want to reach those viewers who are perfectly happy to watch foreign films.” The problem is that the sort of Polish movies put out by Phoenix are very different from the arthouse kind. No one is going to mistake Botoks for Ida, Paweł Pawlikowski’s haunting 2014 Oscar-winner, and Vega is no Krzysztof Kieślowski.With that in mind, Phoenix is planning to widen its slate to feature highbrow releases as well as, say, the forthcoming Kobiety mafii sequels. “We’re looking at projects geared toward lovers of foreign films in Britain,” says Michalec. “We have one in the pipeline that’s a Polish-British production aimed at arty audiences who tend to avoid the multiplexes.” If Brexit is causing the company any jitters, Michalec is hiding it well. “I don’t think many Polish people will move out. I can’t see it. The community is very settled.”Asked about his goals for the future, Sweeney doesn’t miss a beat. “My aim is simple,” he says. “A Bafta for best foreign language film.”Pitbull: Last Dog is on release. Narzeczony na Niby (Pretend Fiance) is released on 4 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d337117f7a89ab1ca13330d6998f5acc5eec00a0/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af7bcbbe8def09642e29f0d4dd19f9a5","title":"england under 17s european championship world cup steve cooper","story":"Steve Cooper, the England Under‑17 coach who masterminded the World Cup triumph in October, believes his team’s European Championship favourites tag should be embraced.England’s campaign starts on Friday against Israel at Chesterfield’s Proact Stadium, with Switzerland and Italy the other Group A sides.Cooper’s side joined Paul Simpson’s under-20s by becoming world champions last year, with a 5-2 win against Spain in India. Yet Manchester City’s golden ball winner Phil Foden and Liverpool’s eight-goal golden boot winner Rhian Brewster are now – along with all players born in 2000 – too old.Cooper says: “This is a different under-17 group than won in India – boys born in 2001 – so they’re very much on their own journey on this international stage. Obviously with all teams doing so well in last 12 months, with World Cup wins for the 17s and 20s, and the 19s becoming European champions, too, we know the landscape has changed a little with expectations.As the hosts, Cooper’s side – who are based at the tournament hub, St George’s Park – did not have to qualify, so the 38-year-old arranged bespoke preparation.In a November friendly less than two weeks after England’s World Cup triumph, they defeated Portugal 3-2, before 2-1 victories over Russia and Germany in the buildup to February’s Algarve Tournament, where they were captained by Manchester United’s Jimmy Garner and City’s Tommy Doyle.There, England lost 4-0 against Portugal, drew 1-1 with Germany – the goal scored by Bobby Duncan, who is Steven Gerrard’s cousin – and defeated the Netherlands 2-0. Their last two matches before the Euros were against Brazil in Spain, losing 1-0 and drawing 1-1.Cooper, whose XI against Israel may feature Fulham’s Luca Ashby-Hammond in goal, Doyle in midfield, United’s Mason Greenwood at No 10 and Duncan as centre-forward, says: “We’ve had a different kind of programme and have tried to arrange the most demanding games possible. There’s been some good and not so good results and performances as well. We’ve managed to look at a lot of players this year and it’s different now as we’re in tournament mode. We want to get ready for the first game and feel we’re heading towards that.”After Israel, England face Italy on Monday in Walsall before closing the group phase against Switzerland in Rotherham.Cooper says: “The beauty of the under-17s is that you don’t quite know what you’re playing against and sometimes don’t know what you’ll get from your own boys at these tournaments because it’s their first experience of the Uefa finals.“Israel are a really good team – we’ve studied them closely. Some people may look at the fixture and think it’s going to be straightforward but it’ll be far from it. They qualified comprehensively in a tough group they play good football, they’ve got good attacking players and we’ll be showing them maximum respect.”Cooper’s team should line up in his usual 4-3-3. “We have England DNA: we very much want to play out from the back, dominate possession, play with purpose,” he says. “Build our way up the pitch so we can score as many as possible. And, when we haven’t got it, try and win the ball back as quick as we can.“It’s a real mixed group in terms of the way Israel, Italy and Switzerland play, so we’ve had to get our preparation right.A lethal forward with four goals in five qualifiers, the Manchester City youngster scored twice in his final club appearance before the tournament – a 2-1 win for the under-18s over West Brom.Steven Gerrard’s cousin, expected to join Liverpool this summer after a contract dispute with Manchester City. The centre-forward became the first England player at any level to score a hat-trick against Brazil, in a 4-3 win for the under-16s last year.The goalkeeper, signed in January by Wolverhampton Wanderers, conceded only two goals in five qualifiers.The Partizan Belgrade schemer has an eye for a finish, scoring three times in three qualifiers.The NK Domzale midfielder is dangerous from long range as his 30-yard strike in a 4-1 qualifying victory over Estonia in October illustrated. Managed three goals in six matches.\u0026nbspA forward comfortable at No\u0026nbsp9, the 16-year-old is a regular for IFK Gothenburg’s under-19s. Scored four times in six qualifiers.“Italy are focused and hardworking – what we associate Italian teams to be – and they have some dangerous attacking players as well that cause problems. They’re athletic and physical players and really good technically – score a lot of goals.“Switzerland have some really technical players and play with a clear identity. They’re well coached, very much adhere to what the team’s tactical ideas are. But we work in a way that we think it’s about us. Rightly we think we can beat anyone we come up against but we’ll have to get it right, that’s for sure.”In a 16-nation tournament, Group B consists of Portugal, Sweden, Slovenia and Norway. Denmark, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Ireland are in Group C, and Germany, the Netherlands, Serbia and Spain Group D.As Cooper, the son of the former Premier League referee Keith, states, the competition will be tough. “It’s important to say that you can win in many ways in the development teams – winning tournaments is one form,” he says. “But however this goes it’s still going to be a massive learning experience.“I think there’s a bit of a thought that we’re going to be favourites again and we’re going to win it – that’s what winning makes you do. But we’re not going to lose sight that this is a development tournament.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3caa9747a9e2b779c91ab3aca12c03c4e63e1fc/0_147_4147_2489/master/4147.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4898c7b9415d5783446d3970082943e8","title":"liverpool real madrid spanish press champions league final","story":"The Spanish media, unsurprisingly, is mostly backing Madrid – ‘The final could be most unequal in a decade’ – but Catalonia’s El Mundo Deportivo hopes ‘Hero Klopp’ can deny the holdersAnd so, it is a repeat of the 1981 European Cup final between Liverpool and Real Madrid, only there is virtually no way this will be a repeat of that. Watch it back and it is awful: a dirty, disjointed game of barely any passes, even fewer chances and pretty much no football, played on a pitch that was embarrassingly bad. It finished 1-0 when the Liverpool left-back Alan Kennedy scored the only goal. It is hard to imagine that being repeated this time round: these two teams survived semi-finals that finished 7-6 and 4-3.The balance has changed too. Back then Liverpool were favourites, playing their third final in five years, while Madrid had not been there in 15 years this time Madrid are playing their fourth final in five years and Liverpool their first in 11. In the pages of Marca, five journalists gave their verdict on the question: “Are Madrid favourites?” Four said yes the one that said no, perhaps because someone had to, offered inexperience as a quality. “No one in the Liverpool team has lifted the cup, which is motivation,” Samuel García wrote.Marca reports on “the goal machine” that will face Madrid but, while there is little doubt that Liverpool have done something special, that does not necessarily mean they win the Champions League. Most in Spain think they will not – and all the more so after Wednesday night in Rome. The Catalan sports daily El Mundo Deportivo lead on “Hero Klopp”, and they cling to him, but for them to really embrace him he must beat Madrid. “Liverpool are finalists but they sow doubts,” ran the headline in Sport. Not least because Madrid are, well, Madrid. And, according to Guillem Balagué in AS, there is something familiar about them. “Liverpool score before games have been defined,” he wrote. “It turns out that RM do just the same.”Julian Ruiz in El Mundo said: “It’s hard for Madrid fans to know if they can beat Liverpool. But I’m an optimistic realist and I think Madrid are virtual winners already. Why? Because Liverpool will be crushed by Madrid’s legend. Beating them is like beating the Invincibles, although Klopp thinks Zidane’s Madrid is a giant with feet of clay and there’s some sense in that.”Ismael Monzon wrote in the same newspaper: “When four long-haired lads got together to play in rough gaffs in Liverpool, someone saw them and said: ‘These guys have talent.’ Half a century later, Jürgen Klopp, aware that no one likes rigidity and conformity in the city, did the same. He let them strum their guitars and go out and play with the brakes off.“It’s curious that this band is dominated by one of the best orchestra directors in international football and that the fifth Beatle – the irony of globalisation – is an Egyptian called Mohamed. But Salah wasn’t the executioner of his former team this time he let the Mané be the soloist.”At the other end, though, it is a different story. “They say that defence is the best attack and the old adage reflects the state of things in this unbalanced Liverpool team,” wrote Diego Torres in El País. “Klopp’s greatest achievement has been building a super-competitive team with a second-rate defence and a limited midfield made up of serious, professional players but with no class and little invention.“Surprisingly it was enough, because every time the ball flew into Karius’s area, the alarm bells rang. The team that challenges Madrid in Kiev travels with a reckless defence. The final in Kiev looks like being the most unequal in a decade.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/599064ce0d62e4ad29a4323204cda37b0bb4df96/0_744_10328_6198/master/10328.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4457f7fe8c6ffd0ce502ee6cb0bc71e","title":"how to make the perfect rhubarb crumble","story":"It’s a comfort food classic, and great for when there’s still a bit of a chill in the air, but what does it take to make it just right?If the proof of the pudding is in the eating, then crumble is comfortingly solid evidence that the best desserts aren’t delicate or even pretty: this isn’t a dish to stun social media, but it will momentarily silence the table. I can confidently say I’ve never, even in the darkest days of school dinners, met anyone who doesn’t like crumble.Of course, you can stash just about any fruit you like under that buttery, sugary topping – though as Jesse Dunford Wood notes in his book Modern British Food, not all are appropriate – but the natural astringency of rhubarb, an underrated vegetable-identifying-as-a-fruit that fills the hungry gap between autumn apples and the first summer fruits, is the perfect complement, and a time-honoured partner for a jug of custard. (Dunford Wood also has strong opinions about the correct accompaniments to the crumble. He correctly identifies custard as the ideal).When I asked for recipe recommendations for this column, someone scornfully responded, “Who uses a recipe for crumble?” They’re right: anyone can make a decent rhubarb crumble. But how do you make a perfect one?Cookery writers and chefs, including the great Jane Grigson, tend to be snooty about outdoor rhubarb – “fat and stringy monsters, mostly all green and with just the faint remembrance of pink”, as Simon Hopkinson memorably puts it in Second Helpings Of Roast Chicken – but I suspect that’s as much to do with its unremarkable looks as its flavour. The spindly, blushing-pink stalks of January and February are easy for the camera to love, while the olive trunks as thick as a terrier’s ankle are far less Instagram-friendly. They still taste great, however – and, as one of the easiest things to grow in pots that I know, deserve a bit more love from us ingrates in the food media.You’ll need to sweeten the filling somehow, but don’t go overboard: the key to success is to maintain the contrast between tangy fruit and sweet topping. The neutral sweetness of white sugar is ideal here, to allow the rhubarb to shine, but seeing as I’m using demerara in the topping, it makes sense to stick with that here, too.For some reason, rhubarb has gained a reputation as a fruit that pairs well with strawberries. I’m instinctively repulsed by the idea, but after reading in the Riverford book that “Jane used to think that cooking strawberries was an abomination, but this combination came as a very pleasant surprise”, I’m prepared to give it a whirl. Turns out it’s not just me: everyone hates it. Perhaps it’s just too early in the season, but the baked strawberries have an odd, mushy texture, and very little flavour at all. Always nice to have one’s prejudices confirmed.The apple and rhubarb combination suggested by Anna Jones in her first book, A Modern Way To Cook, proves more popular, though using them in a 1:1 ratio means the softer rhubarb has a tendency to get lost among the more solid chunks of apple. If you must mix your fruits, however, this is probably the best option.One thing that does go with rhubarb is ginger: Iyer grates fresh root into her filling, and also adds orange zest and juice, as does Jones. I like the ginger in particular, but some testers find it a bit fiery, so I’m going to leave it out, while recommending anyone who enjoys the warming heat of ginger should be brave enough to give it a try.Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall recommends pairing rhubarb with sweet cicely: “As well as adding a lovely, aromatic edge to a dish, the aniseedy leaves make tart fruits seem sweeter, which means you can use less sugar.” Sadly, I don’t happen to have any in the garden, but if you do, this might also be a good option. I’m less sure about Gregg Wallace’s rhubarb and port idea, but if anyone else has time to try it, I’d love to hear your thoughts.Dunford Wood may be right in thinking that tropical fruits have no place in a crumble, but he loses some credibility with his attempts to take back control by cooking the two elements separately: “fewer soggy crumble issues and more consistency with the fruity filling, I find.” This is disappointing indeed: as Baxter’s second rule of crumble states, “Never cook the two parts separately or deconstruct the crumble in any way. This is an abomination.” (Like cooked strawberries, in fact.)Delicious as Dunford Wood’s biscuity, crunchy, honey-sweet topping is, it lacks the wonderfully soggy layer that forms as the fruit steams beneath one of the hallmarks of a proper crumble, we all agree. If you want a fancy, restaurant-style dish, by all means follow his lead, but make sure you serve it with crème anglaise, rather than besmirching the noble name of Bird’s with such foolishness. (And if you want your crumble in a hurry, Anna Jones’ super-quick pan version, which can be put together in less than 15 minutes, is an excellent version.)Many recipes add oats or ground almonds to their crumble mixtures. Both have their fans – and their downsides. Too many chewy, stodgy oats, and the topping becomes a flapjack more ground almonds than flour, and it falls apart at the first touch of the spoon (though the American website Chef Steps has a clever, flour-free version using ground almonds and egg yolks that may be of interest to coeliacs). The sweetness of almonds does go well with rhubarb, however, so I’ll be using a smaller proportion, and topping the dish with chopped almonds, an idea stolen from Jones, though I won’t be using coconut oil or sugar as she suggests. Far too exotic.Both dark and light brown sugars have their merits in this context, but we’re all smitten by the crunch of Dunford Wood’s demerara-flecked topping, even if it’s never seen a stick of rhubarb in its life. A proper school-style crumble should be satisfyingly solid, almost craggy, which requires a generous amount of butter and a splash of water to bring it together chill it before use to help it clump in the correct fashion.Iyer and Hopkinson both add ground ginger to their crumble mixture, Delia Smith sticks in cinnamon as well, Edd Kimber cardamom and Baxter crushed amaretti, but I think it’s delicious enough on its own. Serve with custard, preferably Bird’s, and preferably with a skin as thick as a rhinoceros hide, or plain ice-cream. Also delicious cold for breakfast.800g rhubarb40g demerara or white sugar 25g skin-on almonds, roughly chopped (optional)For the crumble topping150g plain flour 75g ground almonds170g chilled, unsalted butter, grated or diced75g demerara sugar¼ tsp saltHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6.

What lies behind Kanye West’s recent provocations?Photograph: Smallz \u0026amp RaskindContour by Getty ImageIn a video viewed more than 6m times on Twitter, 21-year-old Chika Oranika summed up the current feelings of many black Americans about Kanye West. She delivered her own lyrics over the beat of the rap star’s Jesus Walks. “How you say you Yeezus but do nothing to restore us? You support the people up in power that abort us,” she raps into the camera. “It don’t matter how much money you got or you lack, when that cheque clear don’t forget that your children are still black.”Why the opprobrium, which has come from activists, Hollywood stars and fellow musicians, as well as withering online freestyles? West, one of the most significant, complex and celebrated rappers in the US, has used a 350-tweet stream of consciousness over the past fornight to throw his support firmly behind Donald Trump. But yesterday, he went way beyond party politics in an interview with TMZ, saying, in a sloppy bit of rhetoric: “You hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sounds like a choice.”Host Van Lathan tore back at him: “While you are making music and being an artist and living the life that you’ve earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives.” Roxane Gay reacted on Twitter by calling his comments “dangerous” and “trite, shallow … he is not a free thinker. He is a free moron.”In response, R\u0026ampB singer Frank Ocean emerged from hibernation with a sarcastic screengrab of the time West went off-script during a 2005 Hurricane Katrina appeal to say “George Bush doesn’t care about black people”, the intimation being that it is now West who doesn’t care. Samuel L Jackson suggested West was courting an audience in “the sunken place” – the psychic interzone in the horror film Get Out into which black people are hypnotised and silenced (the film’s director, Jordan Peele, has previously linked it to Trump’s America).“So many people who love you feel so betrayed right know because they know the harm that Trump’s policies cause, especially to people of colour,” West’s friend John Legend wrote in a text message that West posted on Twitter. The rap star wrote back: “You bringing up my fans or my legacy is a tactic based on fear used to manipulate my free thought.” Among ordinary Americans, meanwhile, there was seething anger at West supporting someone who has reportedly said “laziness is a trait in blacks” who campaigned for the death penalty for the black teenagers, later proven innocent, in the Central Park Five case and who thought there were some “very fine people” marching alongside neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville.Reacting to – or having perhaps anticipated – all this, West released a new track, Ye Vs the People, the first music from two new albums being released in June. In a dialogue with the American people (vocalised by rapper T.I.), Kanye tries to detoxify the Trump brand and reclaim his Make America Great Again slogan: “Wearin’ the hat’ll show people that we equal,” he raps, arguing for a why-can’t-we-all-just-get-along humanism. He ultimately distils the debate thus: “You on some choosin’ side shit, I’m on some unified shit.”For Kanye, this chapter is just the latest incident in an uncompromising career. At the turn of the century, as a beatmaker for Jay-Z and others, he really did seem to be on “some unified shit”, taking the chopped-up soul samples of “backpack” hip-hop and pairing them with the blockbuster tropes of mainstream rap production he then successfully segued into being a unified producer-rapper. His first two albums charmed the whole spectrum of rap fans with their ersity and humour: he riffed on black cultural reference points – slow-jam love songs, social climbers – like a standup comedian.His albums became more ambitious with each new release, unifying erse cultural reference points – Graduation sampled Daft Punk and explored a more electronic sound 808s \u0026amp Heartbreak used Auto-Tune to reflect and enact emotional dissonance, to brilliant effect My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was as operatic as the title suggests. His interest in visual art grew, with artists from Takashi Murakami to George Condo commissioned for his album covers he designed his own fashion collections and collaborated with Adidas. In 2013, he said: “Creative genius, that’s my title. My title is not rapper any more.” West positioned himself as a rounded aesthete, obsessed with form and how art impacts society – his Twitter feed has recently featured everything from tech solutions for water desalination to artists Joseph Beuys and David Hammons. Part of his attraction to Kardashian seemed to be her very iconography: “My girl a superstar all from a home movie”, he wondered admiringly on 2012 track Clique.He also continued his analysis of black America. On the same track he raps: “You know white people get money, don’t spend it  Or maybe they get money, buy a business  I’d rather buy 80 gold chains and go ig’nant.” West sees himself as celebrating the economic freedom black Americans were denied for decades, and to which they still have much less access than whites. It’s an extension of a key Jay-Z line – “I do this for my culture, to let ’em know what a nigga look like, when a nigga in a roadster” – from Izzo (HOVA), a track that Kanye produced.And since Yeezus, his self-obsession has become stifling. His 2016 album The Life of Pablo has a great skit called I Love Kanye, where he imagines: “What if Kanye made a song about Kanye called I Miss the Old Kanye? Man, that’d be so Kanye!”In the wake of his slavery comments, the skit stops being funny: black people really do miss the old, outward-looking Kanye. Rapper Meek Mill summed up the thoughts of many when he posted an image of Kanye to Instagram yesterday, surrounded by the words “RIP Old Kanye” and quoting Kanye’s lyrics back at him: “I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny  And what I do? Act more stupidly.”The problem is that Kanye’s self-scrutiny has become so advanced that he is beginning to see the world purely through the prism of Kanye, rather than the eyes of black America. That’s harmful not just to himself, but to an ongoing civil rights struggle in a still-racist US his provocations have the potential to embolden the alt-right and others who would diminish the standing of African Americans.Like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, both figures he admires, it’s hard to place Kanye on to a left-right political binary. His personal political philosophy doesn’t neatly dovetail with existing belief systems – witness how the alt-right embraced him after his championing of Trump, and then deserted him when he also championed Parkland shooting survivor and activist Emma Gonzalez last weekend.Any analysis is complicated by West’s hospitalisation for two weeks in 2016 after a mental breakdown, following intense touring and an incident where Kardashian was robbed in Paris. He has recast the episode as a “breakthrough” and says he is using medication that “helps calm me down” Kardashian has expressed frustration at how Kanye is framed as mentally ill when he is “just being himself when he has always been expressive”. And of course, there is a long history of black people being dismissed as crazy.• This article was amended on 3 May 2018 to add the word “reportedly” in relation to a quote attributed to Donald Trump: while a former employee said in a 1991 book that Trump had told him “laziness is a trait in blacks”, Trump has denied saying that or anything like it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c53fbc0b3e76f2fe56ffb9403d9961e0bfe49eba/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73e8bb212e5d7da97d50ec9a91291025","title":"russell simmons issues statement supporting metoo","story":"The hip-hop mogul says the #MeToo conversation has inspired him ‘to look beyond my personal scenario’, while he has repeatedly denied multiple accusations of sexual harassment and rapeRussell Simmons has spoken up in favour of #MeToo movement, saying it has “ inspired me to look beyond my personal scenario”. The hip-hop mogul is facing at least 13 accusations of sexual harassment and rape, and is the subject of a New York City police department special victims unit investigation.Simmons has repeatedly denied accusations against him, including in court documents filed on 4 April, in which he denied raping film-maker Jennifer Jarosik, who is suing him for $5m (£3.68m). In a statement posted to his Instagram account as the caption to an image that stated, “Shoutout to black women just because”, Simmons reiterated this position, but accepted the net benefits of the #MeToo movement: “A little blood on my shoulders so that my daughters see a better world is worth it.”At least seven women have accused Simmons of sexual assault, including fashion publicist Kelly Cutrone, and at least six women have accused him of rape. In November 2017, Simmons stepped down from his role in Def Jam records, the label he cofounded with Rick Rubin, along with his yoga lifestyle brand, other media properties and CNNMoney. HBO removed his name from All Def Comedy, a series he created to showcase up-and-coming comedians.In response to allegations of sexual assault from screenwriter Jenny Lumet last November, Simmons wrote: “While her memory of that evening is very different from mine, it is now clear to me that her feelings of fear and intimidation are real. While I have never been violent, I have been thoughtless and insensitive in some of my relationships over many decades and I sincerely apologise.”Following four further accusations of rape in December 2017, Simmons posted another now-deleted statement to Instagram, pledging to clear his name: “Today, I begin to properly defend myself. I will prove without any doubt that I am innocent of all rape charges,” Simmons posted, beneath an image that read #NOTME.Simmons has also used his Instagram account to ask people to help rapper Kanye West, who has asserted, among other claims, that slavery “sounds like a choice”. West and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, have said that speculation about West’s mental health is invasive. Simmons suggested West was “unravelling in public”, and called on the hip-hop community to support him: “I refuse to believe a black man who supports black empowerment but now says ‘Slavery was a choice’ is operating with a healthy state of mind,” Simmons wrote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6521c9a88605311063c9854becb28d7bea2fe65c/430_240_7063_4237/master/7063.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc19d3b91f9618645090920dda05b403","title":"the asia tour review impressive berlin phil showcase as rattles reign nears end","story":"ChoWangBerliner PhilharmonikerRattle (Berliner Philharmoniker Recordings, five SACDs and Blu-ray) An astonishingly vivid Petrushka is the highlight of a thoroughly documented final Asian tourIn November last year, Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic gave a series of concerts in Hong Kong, China, South Korea and Japan. It was the last tour of Asia that Rattle would undertake as the orchestra’s chief conductor, and their performances are thoroughly documented on these discs. Four of the five audio CDs are derived from the final pair of concerts, which were given in Tokyo’s magnificent Suntory Hall, while the other, a performance of Ravel’s G Major Piano Concerto with the winner of the 2015 Warsaw Chopin competition Seong-Jin Cho as soloist, was recorded in the Berlin Philharmonie before the tour began. The Blu-ray disc contains videos of the same seven works, taken from the concerts given by Rattle and his orchestra in Hong Kong, Wuhan and Seoul. The recordings are astonishingly vivid, and the whole set provides a very impressive showcase of the Berlin Phil’s current condition as it nears the end of Rattle’s reign. The highlight is definitely the high-voltage performance of Stravinsky’s Petrushka, taken at quite a lick, but crammed with telling detail and sharply characterised solo playing, while at the other extreme is a distinctly uninvolving account of Brahms’s Fourth Symphony, equally well played but over-moulded, as so many of Rattle’s performances of late Romantic symphonies tend to be nowadays. There’s a typically energised account of Strauss’s tone poem Don Juan, and a dazzlingly fleet but rather lightweight one of Bartók’s Second Piano Concerto, with Yuja Wang as the soloist. But Rachmaninov’s Third Symphony is, I think, new to the Rattle discography (though he did record the Second in the 1980s, with the LA Philharmonic). It’s a dark, sometimes rather sluggish reading, though the textures are sumptuous. A new work was commissioned for the tour, too. Chorós Chordón, by the Seoul-born, Berlin resident Unsuk Chin, is a dense web of melodic tendrils, led by the strings, which vanishes into thin air as abruptly as it begins. The set is presented in what has become the familiarly lavish way of Berliner Philharmoniker recordings, complete with a handsomely illustrated hardback book. But it may perhaps be repackaged more affordably in a couple of years’ time, like the orchestra’s recent reissues of both Rattle’s rather disappointing Sibelius symphony cycle from 2015, and the recording of Claudio Abbado’s last concert with his former orchestra – Mendelssohn’s incidental music to A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Berlioz’s Symphonie Fantastique – which appeared the following year. The best of it, the superb Stravinsky, is certainly worth hearing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d6fe0a1fb904128707926198d5fcc8b23e407c6/601_0_4131_2479/master/4131.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f86aaa0a570cd21c776d4b6dd9974d9","title":"why silicon valley cant fix itself tech humanism","story":"Tech insiders have finally started admitting their mistakes – but the solutions they are offering could just help the big players get even more powerful. By  Ben Tarnoff and  Moira WeigelBig Tech is sorry. After decades of rarely apologising for anything, Silicon Valley suddenly seems to be apologising for everything. They are sorry about the trolls. They are sorry about the bots. They are sorry about the fake news and the Russians, and the cartoons that are terrifying your kids on YouTube. But they are especially sorry about our brains.Sean Parker, the former president of Facebook – who was played by Justin Timberlake in The Social Network – has publicly lamented the “unintended consequences” of the platform he helped create: “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.” Justin Rosenstein, an engineer who helped build Facebook’s “like” button and Gchat, regrets having contributed to technology that he now considers psychologically damaging, too. “Everyone is distracted,” Rosenstein says. “All of the time.”Ever since the internet became widely used by the public in the 1990s, users have heard warnings that it is bad for us. In the early years, many commentators described cyberspace as a parallel universe that could swallow enthusiasts whole. The media fretted about kids talking to strangers and finding porn. A prominent 1998 study from Carnegie Mellon University claimed that spending time online made you lonely, depressed and antisocial.In the mid-2000s, as the internet moved on to mobile devices, physical and virtual life began to merge. Bullish pundits celebrated the “cognitive surplus” unlocked by crowdsourcing and the tech-savvy campaigns of Barack Obama, the “internet president”. But, alongside these optimistic voices, darker warnings persisted. Nicholas Carr’s The Shallows (2010) argued that search engines were making people stupid, while Eli Pariser’s The Filter Bubble (2011) claimed algorithms made us insular by showing us only what we wanted to see. In Alone, Together (2011) and Reclaiming Conversation (2015), Sherry Turkle warned that constant connectivity was making meaningful interaction impossible.Still, inside the industry, techno-utopianism prevailed. Silicon Valley seemed to assume that the tools they were building were always forces for good – and that anyone who questioned them was a crank or a luddite. In the face of an anti-tech backlash that has surged since the 2016 election, however, this faith appears to be faltering. Prominent people in the industry are beginning to acknowledge that their products may have harmful effects.Internet anxiety isn’t new. But never before have so many notable figures within the industry seemed so anxious about the world they have made. Parker, Rosenstein and the other insiders now talking about the harms of smartphones and social media belong to an informal yet influential current of tech critics emerging within Silicon Valley. You could call them the “tech humanists”. Amid rising public concern about the power of the industry, they argue that the primary problem with its products is that they threaten our health and our humanity.It is clear that these products are designed to be maximally addictive, in order to harvest as much of our attention as they can. Tech humanists say this business model is both unhealthy and inhumane – that it damages our psychological well-being and conditions us to behave in ways that diminish our humanity. The main solution that they propose is better design. By redesigning technology to be less addictive and less manipulative, they believe we can make it healthier – we can realign technology with our humanity and build products that don’t “hijack” our minds.The hub of the new tech humanism is the Center for Humane Technology in San Francisco. Founded earlier this year, the nonprofit has assembled an impressive roster of advisers, including investor Roger McNamee, Lyft president John Zimmer, and Rosenstein. But its most prominent spokesman is executive director Tristan Harris, a former “design ethicist” at Google who has been hailed by the Atlantic magazine as “the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience”. Harris has spent years trying to persuade the industry of the dangers of tech addiction. In February, Pierre Omidyar, the billionaire founder of eBay, launched a related initiative: the Tech and Society Solutions Lab, which aims to “maximise the tech industry’s contributions to a healthy society”.As suspicion of Silicon Valley grows, the tech humanists are making a bid to become tech’s loyal opposition. They are using their insider credentials to promote a particular diagnosis of where tech went wrong and of how to get it back on track. For this, they have been getting a lot of attention. As the backlash against tech has grown, so too has the appeal of techies repenting for their sins. The Center for Humane Technology has been profiled – and praised by – the New York Times, the Atlantic, Wired and others.But tech humanism’s influence cannot be measured solely by the positive media coverage it has received. The real reason tech humanism matters is because some of the most powerful people in the industry are starting to speak its idiom. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel has warned about social media’s role in encouraging “mindless scrambles for friends or unworthy distractions”, and Twitter boss Jack Dorsey recently claimed he wants to improve the platform’s “conversational health”.Even Mark Zuckerberg, famous for encouraging his engineers to “move fast and break things”, seems to be taking a tech humanist turn. In January, he announced that Facebook had a new priority: maximising “time well spent” on the platform, rather than total time spent. By “time well spent”, Zuckerberg means time spent interacting with “friends” rather than businesses, brands or media sources. He said the News Feed algorithm was already prioritising these “more meaningful” activities.Zuckerberg’s choice of words is significant: Time Well Spent is the name of the advocacy group that Harris led before co-founding the Center for Humane Technology. In April, Zuckerberg brought the phrase to Capitol Hill. When a photographer snapped a picture of the notes Zuckerberg used while testifying before the Senate, they included a discussion of Facebook’s new emphasis on “time well spent”, under the heading “wellbeing”.This new concern for “wellbeing” may strike some observers as a welcome development. After years of ignoring their critics, industry leaders are finally acknowledging that problems exist. Tech humanists deserve credit for drawing attention to one of those problems – the manipulative design decisions made by Silicon Valley.But these decisions are only symptoms of a larger issue: the fact that the digital infrastructures that increasingly shape our personal, social and civic lives are owned and controlled by a few billionaires. Because it ignores the question of power, the tech-humanist diagnosis is incomplete – and could even help the industry evade meaningful reform. Taken up by leaders such as Zuckerberg, tech humanism is likely to result in only superficial changes. These changes may soothe some of the popular anger directed towards the tech industry, but they will not address the origin of that anger. If anything, they will make Silicon Valley even more powerful.The Center for Humane Technology argues that technology must be “aligned” with humanity – and that the best way to accomplish this is through better design. Their website features a section entitled The Way Forward. A familiar evolutionary image shows the silhouettes of several simians, rising from their crouches to become a man, who then turns back to contemplate his history.“In the future, we will look back at today as a turning point towards humane design,” the header reads. To the litany of problems caused by “technology that extracts attention and erodes society”, the text asserts that “humane design is the solution”. Drawing on the rhetoric of the “design thinking” philosophy that has long suffused Silicon Valley, the website explains that humane design “starts by understanding our most vulnerable human instincts so we can design compassionately”.There is a good reason why the language of tech humanism is penetrating the upper echelons of the tech industry so easily: this language is not foreign to Silicon Valley. On the contrary, “humanising” technology has long been its central ambition and the source of its power. It was precisely by developing a “humanised” form of computing that entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs brought computing into millions of users’ everyday lives. Their success turned the Bay Area tech industry into a global powerhouse – and produced the digitised world that today’s tech humanists now lament.The story begins in the 1960s, when Silicon Valley was still a handful of electronics firms clustered among fruit orchards. Computers came in the form of mainframes then. These machines were big, expensive and difficult to use. Only corporations, universities and government agencies could afford them, and they were reserved for specialised tasks, such as calculating missile trajectories or credit scores.Computing was industrial, in other words, not personal, and Silicon Valley remained dependent on a small number of big institutional clients. The practical danger that this dependency posed became clear in the early 1960s, when the US Department of Defense, by far the single biggest buyer of digital components, began cutting back on its purchases. But the fall in military procurement wasn’t the only mid-century crisis around computing.Computers also had an image problem. The inaccessibility of mainframes made them easy to demonise. In these whirring hulks of digital machinery, many observers saw something inhuman, even evil. To antiwar activists, computers were weapons of the war machine that was killing thousands in Vietnam. To highbrow commentators such as the social critic Lewis Mumford, computers were instruments of a creeping technocracy that threatened to extinguish personal freedom.But during the course of the 1960s and 70s, a series of experiments in northern California helped solve both problems. These experiments yielded breakthrough innovations like the graphical user interface, the mouse and the microprocessor. Computers became smaller, more usable and more interactive, reducing Silicon Valley’s reliance on a few large customers while giving digital technology a friendlier face.The pioneers who led this transformation believed they were making computing more human. They drew deeply from the counterculture of the period, and its fixation on developing “human” modes of living. They wanted their machines to be “extensions of man”, in the words of Marshall McLuhan, and to unlock “human potential” rather than repress it. At the centre of this ecosystem of hobbyists, hackers, hippies and professional engineers was Stewart Brand, famed entrepreneur of the counterculture and founder of the Whole Earth Catalog. In a famous 1972 article for Rolling Stone, Brand called for a new model of computing that “served human interest, not machine”.Brand’s disciples answered this call by developing the technical innovations that transformed computers into the form we recognise today. They also promoted a new way of thinking about computers – not as impersonal slabs of machinery, but as tools for unleashing “human potential”.No single figure contributed more to this transformation of computing than Steve Jobs, who was a fan of Brand and a reader of the Whole Earth Catalog. Jobs fulfilled Brand’s vision on a global scale, launching the mass personal computing era with the Macintosh in the mid-80s, and the mass smartphone era with the iPhone two decades later. Brand later acknowledged that Jobs embodied the Whole Earth Catalog ethos. “He got the notion of tools for human use,” Brand told Jobs’ biographer, Walter Isaacson.Building those “tools for human use” turned out to be great for business. The impulse to humanise computing enabled Silicon Valley to enter every crevice of our lives. From phones to tablets to laptops, we are surrounded by devices that have fulfilled the demands of the counterculture for digital connectivity, interactivity and self-expression. Your iPhone responds to the slightest touch you can look at photos of anyone you have ever known, and broadcast anything you want to all of them, at any moment.In short, the effort to humanise computing produced the very situation that the tech humanists now consider dehumanising: a wilderness of screens where digital devices chase every last instant of our attention. To guide us out of that wilderness, tech humanists say we need more humanising. They believe we can use better design to make technology serve human nature rather than exploit and corrupt it. But this idea is drawn from the same tradition that created the world that tech humanists believe is distracting and damaging us.Tech humanists say they want to align humanity and technology. But this project is based on a deep misunderstanding of the relationship between humanity and technology: namely, the fantasy that these two entities could ever exist in separation.It is difficult to imagine human beings without technology. The story of our species began when we began to make tools. Homo habilis, the first members of our genus, left sharpened stones scattered across Africa. Their successors hit rocks against each other to make sparks, and thus fire. With fire you could cook meat and clear land for planting with ash you could fertilise the soil with smoke you could make signals. In flickering light, our ancestors painted animals on cave walls. The ancient tragedian Aeschylus recalled this era mythically: Prometheus, in stealing fire from the gods, “founded all the arts of men.”All of which is to say: humanity and technology are not only entangled, they constantly change together. This is not just a metaphor. Recent research suggests that the human hand evolved to manipulate the stone tools that our ancestors used. The evolutionary scientist Mary Marzke shows that we developed “a unique pattern of muscle architecture and joint surface form and functions” for this purpose.The ways our bodies and brains change in conjunction with the tools we make have long inspired anxieties that “we” are losing some essential qualities. For millennia, people have feared that new media were eroding the very powers that they promised to extend. In The Phaedrus, Socrates warned that writing on wax tablets would make people forgetful. If you could jot something down, you wouldn’t have to remember it. In the late middle ages, as a culture of copying manuscripts gave way to printed books, teachers warned that pupils would become careless, since they no longer had to transcribe what their teachers said.Yet as we lose certain capacities, we gain new ones. People who used to navigate the seas by following stars can now program computers to steer container ships from afar. Your grandmother probably has better handwriting than you do – but you probably type faster.The nature of human nature is that it changes. It can not, therefore, serve as a stable basis for evaluating the impact of technology. Yet the assumption that it doesn’t change serves a useful purpose. Treating human nature as something static, pure and essential elevates the speaker into a position of power. Claiming to tell us who we are, they tell us how we should be.Intentionally or not, this is what tech humanists are doing when they talk about technology as threatening human nature – as if human nature had stayed the same from the paleolithic era until the rollout of the iPhone. Holding humanity and technology separate clears the way for a small group of humans to determine the proper alignment between them. And while the tech humanists may believe they are acting in the common good, they themselves acknowledge they are doing so from above, as elites. “We have a moral responsibility to steer people’s thoughts ethically,” Tristan Harris has declared.Harris and his fellow tech humanists also frequently invoke the language of public health. The Center for Humane Technology’s Roger McNamee has gone so far as to call public health “the root of the whole thing”, and Harris has compared using Snapchat to smoking cigarettes. The public-health framing casts the tech humanists in a paternalistic role. Resolving a public health crisis requires public health expertise. It also precludes the possibility of democratic debate. You don’t put the question of how to treat a disease up for a vote – you call a doctor.This paternalism produces a central irony of tech humanism: the language that they use to describe users is often dehumanising. “Facebook appeals to your lizard brain – primarily fear and anger,” says McNamee. Harris echoes this sentiment: “Imagine you had an input cable,” he has said. “You’re trying to jack it into a human being. Do you want to jack it into their reptilian brain, or do you want to jack it into their more reflective self?”The Center for Humane Technology’s website offers tips on how to build a more reflective and less reptilian relationship to your smartphone: “going greyscale” by setting your screen to black-and-white, turning off app notifications and charging your device outside your bedroom. It has also announced two major initiatives: a national campaign to raise awareness about technology’s harmful effects on young people’s “digital health and well-being” and a “Ledger of Harms” – a website that will compile information about the health effects of different technologies in order to guide engineers in building “healthier” products.These initiatives may help some people reduce their smartphone use – a reasonable personal goal. But there are some humans who may not share this goal, and there need not be anything unhealthy about that. Many people rely on the internet for solace and solidarity, especially those who feel marginalised. The kid with autism may stare at his screen when surrounded by people, because it lets him tolerate being surrounded by people. For him, constant use of technology may not be destructive at all, but in fact life-saving.Pathologising certain potentially beneficial behaviours as “sick” isn’t the only problem with the Center for Humane Technology’s proposals. They also remain confined to the personal level, aiming to redesign how the inidual user interacts with technology rather than tackling the industry’s structural failures. Tech humanism fails to address the root cause of the tech backlash: the fact that a small handful of corporations own our digital lives and strip-mine them for profit. This is a fundamentally political and collective issue. But by framing the problem in terms of health and humanity, and the solution in terms of design, the tech humanists personalise and depoliticise it.This may be why their approach is so appealing to the tech industry. There is no reason to doubt the good intentions of tech humanists, who may genuinely want to address the problems fuelling the tech backlash. But they are handing the firms that caused those problems a valuable weapon. Far from challenging Silicon Valley, tech humanism offers Silicon Valley a useful way to pacify public concerns without surrendering any of its enormous wealth and power. By channelling popular anger at Big Tech into concerns about health and humanity, tech humanism gives corporate giants such as Facebook a way to avoid real democratic control. In a moment of danger, it may even help them protect their profits.One can easily imagine a version of Facebook that embraces the principles of tech humanism while remaining a profitable and powerful monopoly. In fact, these principles could make Facebook even more profitable and powerful, by opening up new business opportunities. That seems to be exactly what Facebook has planned.Zuckerberg said he expected those changes would continue to decrease total time spent – but “the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable”. This may describe what users find valuable – but it also refers to what Facebook finds valuable. In a recent interview, he said: “Over the long term, even if time spent goes down, if people are spending more time on Facebook actually building relationships with people they care about, then that’s going to build a stronger community and build a stronger business, regardless of what Wall Street thinks about it in the near term.”Sheryl Sandberg has also stressed that the shift will create “more monetisation opportunities”. How? Everyone knows data is the lifeblood of Facebook – but not all data is created equal. One of the most valuable sources of data to Facebook is used to inform a metric called “coefficient”. This measures the strength of a connection between two users – Zuckerberg once called it “an index for each relationship”. Facebook records every interaction you have with another user – from liking a friend’s post or viewing their profile, to sending them a message. These activities provide Facebook with a sense of how close you are to another person, and different activities are weighted differently. Messaging, for instance, is considered the strongest signal. It’s reasonable to assume that you’re closer to somebody you exchange messages with than somebody whose post you once liked.Why is coefficient so valuable? Because Facebook uses it to create a Facebook they think you will like: it guides algorithmic decisions about what content you see and the order in which you see it. It also helps improve ad targeting, by showing you ads for things liked by friends with whom you often interact. Advertisers can target the closest friends of the users who already like a product, on the assumption that close friends tend to like the same things.So when Zuckerberg talks about wanting to increase “meaningful” interactions and building relationships, he is not succumbing to pressure to take better care of his users. Rather, emphasising time well spent means creating a Facebook that prioritises data-rich personal interactions that Facebook can use to make a more engaging platform. Rather than spending a lot of time doing things that Facebook doesn’t find valuable – such as watching viral videos – you can spend a bit less time, but spend it doing things that Facebook does find valuable.In other words, “time well spent” means Facebook can monetise more efficiently. It can prioritise the intensity of data extraction over its extensiveness. This is a wise business move, disguised as a concession to critics. Shifting to this model not only sidesteps concerns about tech addiction – it also acknowledges certain basic limits to Facebook’s current growth model. There are only so many hours in the day. Facebook can’t keep prioritising total time spent – it has to extract more value from less time.In many ways, this process recalls an earlier stage in the evolution of capitalism. In the 19th century, factory owners in England discovered they could only make so much money by extending the length of the working day. At some point, workers would die of exhaustion, or they would revolt, or they would push parliament to pass laws that limited their working hours. So industrialists had to find ways to make the time of the worker more valuable – to extract more money from each moment rather than adding more moments. They did this by making industrial production more efficient: developing new technologies and techniques that squeezed more value out of the worker and stretched that value further than ever before.A similar situation confronts Facebook today. They have to make the attention of the user more valuable – and the language and concepts of tech humanism can help them do it. So far, it seems to be working. Despite the reported drop in total time spent, Facebook recently announced huge 2018 Q1 earnings of $11.97bn (£8.7bn), smashing Wall Street estimates by nearly $600m.Today’s tech humanists come from a tradition with deep roots in Silicon Valley. Like their predecessors, they believe that technology and humanity are distinct, but can be harmonised. This belief guided the generations who built the “humanised” machines that became the basis for the industry’s enormous power. Today it may provide Silicon Valley with a way to protect that power from a growing public backlash – and even deepen it by uncovering new opportunities for profit-making.Fortunately, there is another way of thinking about how to live with technology – one that is both truer to the history of our species and useful for building a more democratic future. This tradition does not address “humanity” in the abstract, but as distinct human beings, whose capacities are shaped by the tools they use. It sees us as hybrids of animal and machine – as “cyborgs”, to quote the biologist and philosopher of science Donna Haraway.To say that we’re all cyborgs is not to say that all technologies are good for us, or that we should embrace every new invention. But it does suggest that living well with technology can’t be a matter of making technology more “human”. This goal isn’t just impossible – it’s also dangerous, because it puts us at the mercy of experts who tell us how to be human. It cedes control of our technological future to those who believe they know what’s best for us because they understand the essential truths about our species.The cyborg way of thinking, by contrast, tells us that our species is essentially technological. We change as we change our tools, and our tools change us. But even though our continuous co-evolution with our machines is inevitable, the way it unfolds is not. Rather, it is determined by who owns and runs those machines. It is a question of power.Today, that power is wielded by corporations, which own our technology and run it for profit. The various scandals that have stoked the tech backlash all share a single source. Surveillance, fake news and the miserable working conditions in Amazon’s warehouses are profitable. If they were not, they would not exist. They are symptoms of a profound democratic deficit inflicted by a system that prioritises the wealth of the few over the needs and desires of the many.There is an alternative. If being technological is a feature of being human, then the power to shape how we live with technology should be a fundamental human right. The decisions that most affect our technological lives are far too important to be left to Mark Zuckerberg, rich investors or a handful of “humane designers”. They should be made by everyone, together.Rather than trying to humanise technology, then, we should be trying to democratise it. We should be demanding that society as a whole gets to decide how we live with technology – rather than the small group of people who have captured society’s wealth.What does this mean in practice? First, it requires limiting and eroding Silicon Valley’s power. Antitrust laws and tax policy offer useful ways to claw back the fortunes Big Tech has built on common resources. After all, Silicon Valley wouldn’t exist without billions of dollars of public funding, not to mention the vast quantities of information that we all provide for free. Facebook’s market capitalisation is $500bn with 2.2 billion users – do the math to estimate how much the time you spend on Facebook is worth. You could apply the same logic to Google. There is no escape: whether or not you have an account, both platforms track you around the internet.In addition to taxing and shrinking tech firms, democratic governments should be making rules about how those firms are allowed to behave – rules that restrict how they can collect and use our personal data, for instance, like the General Data Protection Regulation coming into effect in the European Union later this month. But more robust regulation of Silicon Valley isn’t enough. We also need to pry the ownership of our digital infrastructure away from private firms.This means developing publicly and co-operatively owned alternatives that empower workers, users and citizens to determine how they are run. These democratic digital structures can focus on serving personal and social needs rather than piling up profits for investors. One inspiring example is municipal broadband: a successful experiment in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has shown that publicly owned internet service providers can supply better service at lower cost than private firms. Other models of digital democracy might include a worker-owned Uber, a user-owned Facebook or a socially owned “smart city” of the kind being developed in Barcelona. Alternatively, we might demand that tech firms pay for the privilege of extracting our data, so that we can collectively benefit from a resource we collectively create.More experimentation is needed, but democracy should be our guiding principle. The stakes are high. Never before have so many people been thinking about the problems produced by the tech industry and how to solve them. The tech backlash is an enormous opportunity – and one that may not come again for a long time.The old techno-utopianism is crumbling. What will replace it? Silicon Valley says it wants to make the world a better place. Fulfilling this promise may require a new kind of disruption.Main illustration by Lee Martin Design• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f95bf9d57d22ffecbc9b90994a61e80a6d75e98/0_0_3500_2427/master/3500.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=359cfcf9a740da6b20a75b5cd33b73e5 1760w","title":"to outer space via david davis looking glass world of brexit","story":"The Brexit department has plans for Venus but nothing to declare on the customs unionDavid Davis isn’t noted for his grasp of detail. Or for his grasp of anything very much. But at Brexit questions in the Commons, he took his lack of awareness to new heights by seeming to forget there had been a meeting of the inner cabinet the previous day. He’s going to get a hell of a shock when someone gently informs him that not only was he there but he voted against the prime minister’s preferred customs partnership option. Before long he will be struggling to remember his own name. If only that were possible for the rest of us.Brexit questions used to guarantee a nearly full house in the chamber, but the number of MPs bothering to attend have now dwindled to a mere handful. There’s only so much futility anyone can take and most have long since decided there’s only a certain number of times they can slip through Davis’s looking-glass world before they don’t come back.Of those few – those unhappy few – who did decide to take one for the team and risk their mental health, almost all wanted an urgent update on the customs union. With the government no nearer to deciding what kind of future trading relationship it wants with the EU nearly two years after the referendum, time is running out to reach an agreement by October.EU members (plus Turkey, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino) trade without customs duties, taxes or tariffs between themselves, and charge the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU. Customs union members cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU, which is why leaving it – while hopefully negotiating a bespoke arrangement – has been one of the government’s Brexit goals.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.“The customs union is a very complex issue,” said Davis, confidently channelling his inner Alice. “So it should be no surprise that it is taking a long time.” A few MPs began reaching for their medication. It was going to be a long hour. They didn’t need to be told how complicated it all was as they knew that already. The issue was that the government had taken so long to getting round to realise that fact for itself. Davis looked hurt by the criticism and insisted that, despite the customs partnership having been kicked into the long grass the previous day, the government was still actively considering both the customs partnership and a more streamlined model. “Both have their merits and their drawbacks,” he declared. One of which is that the EU has already in effect ruled both proposals out. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, looked at Davis with alarm and pity. Maybe now wasn’t the moment to get him up to speed.On and on Davis went, taking off his glasses, putting them on again and repeating the phrase “deep and special partnership” over and over again until it sounded meaningless even to him. “We are acting in the best interests of the country,” he said. Now it was the turn of the hardline Tory Brexiters to look confused. They had been certain the government was really just doing anything it could to keep them happy and to stay in power. Having talked himself round in circles to a position where everything was equally possible and impossible, Davis sat down and handed over to his junior minister. In a former life, Robin Walker may have been fully sentient, but his boss’s intellectual impairment has proved contagious and he can now barely string a sentence together.What did the people living on both sides of the Irish border think of the government’s proposed solutions, asked Labour’s Karin Smyth. “Um, er, um, er, everyone understands the importance of a frictionless border,” Walker mumbled. “Um, er, um, er, we’re still talking.” Though not in a language anyone but he and Davis understands. Walker was then asked what steps had been taken to find a technological solution to the Irish border. “None whatsoever,” he said proudly. Davis patted him on the back. That’s my boy.To general amazement and concern, Walker was made to look an intellectual giant by the arrival to the dispatch box of the department’s most recent ministerial recruit. Having dismissed the government’s own research into the economic impact of leaving the customs union as rubbish, Suella Braverman then made her big pitch for the future. Outer space. No matter that we can’t even solve the Irish border, Britain would conquer the universe and be a world leader in trade with Venus and Neptune. To infinity and beyond. Just another day in Brexit in Wonderland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/633add0bb836bec5fcab37626824c31c10ce825e/0_134_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e929c211f8e05939b9d06c5f54c28025","title":"uk voters turned away polling stations id trial","story":"Pilot scheme in five areas leads to people being unable to vote due to ‘ineligible’ identificationVoters have been turned away from polling stations in at least two of the five areas trialling the government’s controversial compulsory ID scheme, prompting concerns that some people are being disenfranchised.Angela Wilkins, the leader of the Labour group on Bromley council in south-east London, one of the boroughs involved in the pilot project, said four polling stations being used for the local elections on Thursday had told her that by 10.30am, they had already turned away five people between them for not having ID.“By that stage, there had been 25 votes at one of the stations, which could mean just 100 votes cast overall, and already five people turned away,” she said.“If that turns out to be the case, it’s a much higher rate of people having difficulties than anyone expected.”Ellie Reeves, the Labour MP for Lewisham West and Penge, an area that covers part of Bromley, described the pilot project as “plain wrong”.In Woking, another of the boroughs testing the scheme, a Labour councillor said a man was turned away because his form of ID, a Surrey county council document with his picture on it, was not accepted. “This gentleman turned up, showed his ID, which included a picture that was clearly him – it was an exact resemblance – but they wouldn’t accept it as it was not on the list of acceptable forms of ID,” Tahir Aziz said.Elsewhere in Woking, one voter said he had initially been told he could not use his rail photo pass as ID.Stuart Wilks-Heeg, an expert on electoral integrity at the University of Manchester, said he had observed three polling stations in Woking, spending at least an hour at each. Of 90 people arriving to vote, he saw two turned away.The pilot seemed to otherwise be running very smoothly from what he saw, he said. “Polling station staff really well briefed and voters clearly knew about the requirements,” he said.The trial, which could see the idea extended across England for future elections, means voters in Bromley, Woking and Gosport have to show photo ID, or two items showing their address from a list of approved documents. Those in Watford and Swindon must bring their polling cards, while there are separate tests connected to postal votes.The scheme has prompted concerns from charities and others that it could disenfranchise more vulnerable voters who are less likely to have access to the necessary ID, for example, older people and those who are homeless.Labour has also said it could unfairly affect those such as the Windrush generation, who do not have adequate documentation through no fault of their own.The Cabinet Office argues that it is necessary to prevent voter impersonation and voter ID has been recommended by the Electoral Commission.But critics have said it is an overreaction to a marginal problem, with none of the five trial boroughs having reported a single incident of voter impersonation over the past decade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91df1cd4351136126dfe9337d2ad0b963448b009/0_44_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a83319ea5632cd89c90221612ac8854","title":"local elections 2018 polling day live","story":"Follow the latest developments as voters go to the polls in the biggest test for the political parties since the general election.The EU plans to defy Tory Brexiters and retain its offices in London – the former Conservative central office at 32 Smith Square – as an outpost from which to communicate with British citizens after Brexit, leaked documents reveal.High-profile Brexiters had called last year for the EU to hand back the large red-brick building that was previously Margaret Thatcher’s headquarters and the scene of her general election victories.The European commission and the European parliament jointly purchased the Westminster building for £20m in 2010 after 50 years of Tory ownership, and renamed it Europe House.Jacob Rees-Mogg MP, the chairman of the European Research Group, had suggested it would be a “wonderful” gesture of goodwill if, during the negotiations over the UK’s £39bn orce bill, the building was returned.But a leaked note on the administrative consequences of Brexit, seen by the , makes clear that the EU is keen to retain the advantages of the building and its plum position close to the houses of parliament in Westminster.Klaus Welle, the European parliament’s secretary general, said the EU would need a position from which to champion the interests of its own citizens living in the UK, and to communicate its messages to the British.Voter ID problems continue to be reported in the trial areas.Angela Wilkins, leader of the Labour group in Bromley, counted five people being turned away because lack of voter ID at various Bromley polling stations.Stuart Wilk-Heeg, who is chairman Democratic Audit, says he was offered more cups of tea in the polling stations he visited in Woking than he witnessed voters being turned away. And there is growing concern about inconsistencies in the rules for the five trial areas and the way they are being applied.The presiding officer at the polling station in Sydenham Tennis Club, in the Borough of Bromley, said “Only a very small percentage” of voters had forgotten or were unable to provide ID. The man, who did not wish to be named, said residents had received five pieces of information explaining the change in the rules, including leaflets, a note with their polling cards and a note on the information about recycling and bin collection. He added: “Voters always have the choice to go home and get some ID.” Kirsteen Ross, 67, who lives nearby, said she had received at least two leaflets about the change, although no polling cards had been delivered down her street. “Polling cards are important because they’re a reminder,” she said. When asked if she thought the scheme was a good idea, she replied: “No, it’s another restriction on civil liberties - it’s just another way to marginalise people who are already marginalised. They might not have any photo ID.” Labour councillor Tahir Aziz said a man was turned away from voting at a polling station on Walton Road in Woking because his form of ID, a Surrey County Council document with his picture on it, was not accepted. Aziz said: “This gentleman turned up, showed his ID which included a picture that was clearly him, it was an exact resemblance, but they wouldn’t accept it as it was not on the list of acceptable forms of ID. He was fuming. He was furious. He is a British national and he couldn’t vote. It is having an impact on certain people being disenfranchised by this trial.”  Cat Smith MP, shadow minister for voter engagement, said: “The Government was warned by the Equality and Human Rights Commission and over 40 leading charities and academics the voter ID will have a disproportionate impact on older people, young people, BME communities, trans people and disabled people. “But instead of listening to the experts and the vast evidence base, the Government decided to implement a mistaken policy with the full knowledge that voters could be disenfranchised. The fact that voters were denied their right to vote is proof that voter ID has no place in our democracy.” Jakub Krupa, the UK correspondent for the Polish Press Agency, is tracking the fate of 117 Polish candidates standing for election today including 48 for Polish Pride and 28 Polish Tories. Voters have also been turned away in Swindon one of the five trial areas, according to reports. Problems have been also been reported in Bromley and Woking, two of the other five areas piloting mandatory voter ID. Swindon council has reminded voters that bus passes don’t count as ID in the trial, even if they do include a photograph of the holder. Confusingly different rules apply on what constitutes valid ID in the various pilot areas. Woking, for example, does accept bus passes.There is a mixed picture on the turn out in Kensignton and Chelsea, writes Goda Naujokaityte. Some polling stations report a “steady” stream of voters others are empty. Here’s how things currently stand. Lib Dem leader Vince Cable turned up to vote with his wife Rachel in Twickenham. She had a polling card but he didn’t. More voter ID problems reported in two of areas, Bromley and Woking, piloting mandatory ID at polling stations. Ellie Reeves, Labour MP for Lewisham West and Peng, was told of two people being turned away from voting in Bromley because they didn’t have ID.A 76-year-old Bromley resident told The Independent he was “shocked” to be turned away because he did not have a bank card or passport.And a voter in Woking had trouble using a rail season ticket as proof of ID as recommended by a local councillor. Susan, who lives in Bromley, brought her passport to the polling station this morning:“There wasn’t a huge amount of publicity about needing to bring ID today but I was fine. I got the impression, though, that there wasn’t a system in place for recording those who turned up without ID and couldn’t vote. You would think with a pilot scheme that kind of information would be recorded. “There will be some who will go and come back and others who won’t. In that sense, I think the pilot disenfranchises some people – especially the elderly, who may not be able to return, or young people on limited income who don’t have the relevant ID.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bac369a417a0fc80cc46e526fef74bec6af71574/0_0_6574_3945/master/6574.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb6295b29e9b2f43d7204aecd1a9f74d","title":"kew gardens temperate house reopens after restoration","story":"Five-year project involved moving 10,000 plants and replacing 15,000 panes of glassAfter five years, 10,000 plants uprooted and replanted, 15,000 panes of glass replaced, 69,000 sections of metal, stone and timber repaired or replaced, enough scaffolding to stretch the length of the M25, and £41m spent, the largest Victorian glasshouse in the world is ready to open its doors again. The Temperate House in Kew Gardens is once again, as the naturalist Sir David Attenborough describes it, “a breathtakingly beautiful space”.The great glass and iron doors to this botanical cathedral, first opened in 1863, closed in 2013 for the most complex restoration project in the history of Kew Gardens, and will reopen to the public on Saturday.The building once again shelters several unique species that have become extinct in the wild, including the cycad Encephalartos woodii, which survived since the era when its spikes helped protect it from dinosaurs but is now labelled “the loneliest tree in the world” because only male specimens survive. Attenborough is one of the many local residents who have missed the great glasshouse terribly and will return to it with joy. “When I had an office job I used to come to Kew at weekends when I was depressed and take deep breaths,” he recalled. “It’s lovely.”He described Kew as the most important botanical institute in the world. “In some circumstances the only way you can prove that a particular species is that species is to come to Kew and compare what you have with what is here. This is why people come from all over the world come to the Kew herbarium and to these great glasshouses.”Far more light is now streaming into the glasshouse, partly because the tallest plants, which were brushing the ridge of the roof, have been pruned or replaced with shorter specimens, which has also permitted much denser planting now the space beneath them is no longer shaded out.Another of the treasures is Dombeya mauritiana, a tree that was thought to be extinct in the wild until Carlos Magdalena led an expedition from Kew, found one growing in the highlands of Mauritius, formed part of a human ladder to reach the lowest branch and take cuttings, and brought it back to make Kew the only place in the world to have succeeded in cultivating the plant.Several of the plants are part of international conservation projects to preserve or reintroduce them in the wild, including the Nepalese Taxus wallichiana, source of the anti-cancer drug Taxol.Richard Barley, the director of horticulture at Kew, said the project was an example of world-class horticulture, science and design working together. “It’s been amazing watching this project unfold, the building emerge gloriously and some of the world’s rarest plants safely reach their home.”The oldest part of the Grade I-listed house, designed by Decimus Burton in 1860, was regarded as one of the wonders of the age, and crowds flocked to walk the winding paths and marvel at the exotic plants. However, the full, awesome 628ft (191-metre) length was not completed for decades, and as costs soared the use of cheaper materials and inferior workmanship caused many problems including leaking roofs, corroding metal, rotting timber and decaying stone. Earlier repair jobs caused further problems. The present work, which cost far more than the original estimate of £34.3m and has been funded by grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the government, included reopening ventilators painted shut half a century ago.

Rugby union facing an extinction crisis in Sydney ran a headline this week and if Perth is hardly a union city, it is far from alone.The belief is that non-rugby followers could be enticed if games contain more action and fewer of the game’s arcane rituals, like scrummaging and competing for the ball in a lineout. The more tries the better, although how many points will a side score if a move starts outside its 22, from a scrum or a line-out say, but the ball is passed backwards into it before the decisive break is made?The vast majority of the law changes in recent years have had two central themes: to increase the time the ball is in play and to promote player welfare, but the first has compromised the second. A Rugby Football Union review a few weeks into this season showed the rate of injuries in the Premiership had increased on the previous year because the increased time the ball was in play meant an increase in the number of tackles being made, the area responsible for the majority of injuries.“The attacking side is getting more of the ball because the contact area is virtually not being challenged but facing a greater number of defenders, and we are therefore seeing more tackles,” said the RFU’s director of professional rugby, Nigel Melville. “The increase in tackles is significant as it involves ‘double tackles’ and with greater line speed. And we found last year that it was not the tackled player that predominantly was injured but the tackler.”With the aim of the Perth series to keep the ball in play for longer, expect there to be more tackles and more injuries. The game will move further away from being a contest for possession to one where players smash into each other, no longer a refuge for all shapes and sizes.Australia are not known for placing a premium on scrummaging, but the maximum 60-second affair runs the danger of turning it into a rugby league set-piece, put the ball in and away. Similarly with the line-out: throw in when the opposition are not ready and there is no tussle for possession, nor time for players to get a breather.They will have to wait for a pause in play for injury, although no doubt there will be calls for a rolling substitute to be brought on when a player is down so play can continue and not count as one of the 12. Forrest says that next year’s series will see 10-point tries and set a time-limit on lineouts as well as scrums.How long before both set-pieces are canned and the game moves almost as far away from its roots as the new 100-ball cricket tournament planned in England and Wales? Rugby by name rather than nature, a dumbing down. It is far easier to look at ways of promoting “entertainment” by squeezing features that make union distinct rather than trying to address the central problem of how to create space on the field so that players are not continually clattering into each other from the first minute to last.Not a word about player safety in Perth, but the way the sport is going with each round of league and cup matches scarred by long-term injuries, it could face a class action down the line from players who reach middle age and find that they are unable to work because various parts of their bodies have broken down. Concussion is not the only issue.World Rugby had little choice to approve the law changes with countries like Australia and Scotland, who from 2019-20 will be launching a Super 6 competition to help bridge the gap between club and professional rugby, looking for a stimulus but it needs to tread warily and not be blindly led by commercial interests.• This is an extract taken from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

However, she is adamant that Friday’s uphill finish on the Cow and Calf climb above Ilkley will not suit her, and that she is only a temporary race leader.In 2016 Wild won the inaugural women’s race here after the peloton swept up a rash lone attack from Lizzie Armitstead, and that knowledge stood her in good stead when several front runners followed a motorbike when it turned left into the race vehicle ersion instead of going right at the final roundabout with 800m to go.As others dodged through cones to get back on course, Wild’s team went to the front earlier than they expected, but she still sat pretty until the final crucial moment with all the sang-froid to be expected of a woman in her 15th racing season, heading inexorably for her 73rd race win.The key instant came as Doncaster’s South Parade veered gently to the right in the final 200 metres past the Town Fields. Here, the 2016 world champion Amalie Diederiksen – who deprived Wild of the gold medal in that year’s title in Qatar – was poised to lunge through a gap to Wild’s right, only for the 35-year-old to show her nous by moving briskly to close the door, leaving the young Dane with nowhere to go.On Friday, Wild will become a team rider working for Wiggle’s climbers, Elisa Longo-Borghini and Lisa Brennauer as the race heads for the hills around Otley and Pool in Wharfedale before the final two-kilometre climb on to the moors. It should also suit Great Britain’s Dani King, who had planned to target time bonuses on this flat stage, and landed four seconds which could prove useful in the final reckoning.On the largely flat roads of South Yorkshire, the stronger teams sat tight with Friday in mind, which left openings for the British squads. Trek-Drops sent Anna Christian ahead for the latter part of the stage while Jadan-Weldtite team gambled heavily by sending their junior Pfeiffer Georgi – currently the strongest under-18 woman in Europe – off from the gun. It was a move which netted the 17-year-old the only ranked climb of the day, and with it the Best Climber’s jersey, justifying her team’s presence in the race with just 40 miles covered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c805e6484d81bcbd408d3648fb20f949d729c368/0_70_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?w=1900\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cddcb1504960f5424492a184f13d2cd1 1900w","title":"chinas xiaomi set to raise 10bn on hong kong stock exchange","story":"‘China’s Apple’ turns focus to west and is set to raise $10bn on Hong Kong stock exchangeThe Smartphone maker Xiaomi will begin selling its smartphones in the UK under a partnership with Hutchinson’s Three as “China’s Apple” turns its attention to the west.The news came as the firm announced its IPO on the Hong Kong stock exchange seeking to raise at least $10bn (£7.3bn), in what could be the largest offering since Chinese e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba’s $25bn listing in New York in 2014.Xiaomi, the world’s fourth-largest smartphone maker, has made a name for itself selling high-end phones at rock-bottom prices but has been limited to China and other developing markets, such as India.It made its first move into western Europe by debuting in Spain in November last year. The partnership with Hutchinson will lead to Xiaomi phones being sold through Three stores in the UK and Ireland, as well as Austria, Denmark, Hong Kong and Sweden.“We have been watching Xiaomi’s success from afar and are impressed with the huge range of connected devices that they currently offer,” Three UK’s chief digital officer, Tom Malleschitz, said and added that it opens the door to Xiaomi’s other connected devices such as smart home appliances.Xiaomi’s $10bn fundraising could value the company at up to $100bn, making it the third largest Chinese tech firm by value behind so-called “national champions” Tencent and Alibaba.Xiaomi is the top-selling smartphone brand in India ahead of Samsung and the fourth globally in the first quarter of 2018 behind Samsung, Apple and Huawei, according to the analysts IDC. However, the firm made a a loss of $6.9bn last year.The eight-year-old company first cultivated a following in China by selling imitations of Apple’s iPhone at half the price of the real products, which resulted in it being hit with threats of patent infringement that were seen as keeping Xiaomi out of the west.Xiaomi describes itself as the “triathlete” of Chinese tech firms. Most of its revenue come from smartphone sales, sold at a low-profit margin. The rest comes from selling smart household gadgets – Xiaomi rice cookers, scooters or air conditioners – and online services such as entertainment and financial service apps.In an open letter included in the filing, the 48-year-old founder, Lei Jun, acknowledged the company’s struggles in 2016 when phone sales declined as competitors churned out cheaper options.“It was clear to us that because we grew so quickly in our early years, we did not have an adequately strong foundation to face all the challenges in front of us at the time,” Lei wrote.Xiaomi still depends on China for the majority of its revenues, a challenge given that that market is nearing saturation. For the first time in five years, smartphone shipments dipped below 100m in the first quarter of this year. Xiaomi phones are popular with first-time buyers but shoppers often upgrade to Apple’s iPhone or other phones in later purchases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10af03ea440a46d532a66b0089364655b98025c4/0_45_4388_2633/master/4388.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef40f5e76784350ff26dfd729dbb09d4","title":"can i buy a fast and powerful work laptop for under 700 pounds budget","story":"Ivana is on a budget but still wants a new 13in machine that can handle tougher tasks than email and browsingI left my corporate job a few months ago and now need to purchase a new laptop for my work. I am looking for a 13in laptop in the £500-£700 range. I am not too picky about the aesthetics. What matters most is that it’s fast and can handle more tasks than just email and browsing. What is my best bet? IvanaThis is an interesting question, partly because the mainstream PC market is broadly ided into two main groups. There are lots of low-end laptops aimed at consumers, and they usually cost around £250 to £500. (Yes, there are even cheaper systems.) Examples include the Lenovo Ideapad 110, Asus VivoBook, and lots of HP Pavilion and Dell Inspiron laptops. Most are relatively slow, but some are fast enough for your purposes.There are also lots of upmarket laptops for high-end buyers and freelancers, and they usually cost from £750 to £1,500. (Yes, there are even more expensive systems, especially the ones designed for gaming.) Examples include the Dell XPS 13, Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, HP’s Spectre 13 and EliteBook x360 G2, the Microsoft Surface range and many more. Most of them are thin and fast, but you are also paying a premium for aesthetics.The third option is to look at laptops aimed at IT managers, especially those in large corporations. Most are designed more for durability, reparability and predictability than for speed or style. The main examples are Lenovo (formerly IBM) ThinkPads, Dell Latitudes, and HP Elitebooks. You can also buy refurbished models of these machines from corporate asset management companies such as Tier1Online.It would be useful to know the specification of the laptop that you used in your corporate job, for comparison purposes, and the work involved. How fast was the processor? How much memory did it have? Did it have a traditional hard disk drive or a faster SSD? What was the screen resolution?Was your corporate laptop as fast as you wanted, or did it feel too slow?If you know which CPU you had, you can check its PassMark score, or find it on Notebookcheck’s list of mobile processor benchmarks. You will then be able to make sure you buy a faster CPU and as much or more memory than you had before.A typical corporate laptop today might have an Intel Core i5-5200U or similar processor, 8GB of memory, and a 128GB or 256GB SSD. I reckon you would find that a usable specification. However, it can be very frustrating to go from a fast laptop to a slow one, so try to avoid that.As for size, 13.3in screens are not as popular as they used to be, and there are now models with 10.1in, 11.6in, 12.5in and 14in screens as well. Ultraportables with 10.1in or 11.6in screens are a bit small for everyday use, but 14in models are becoming increasingly common.If you buy a consumer laptop you’ll have the advantage of shopping for one of the better models, but there’s not a lot to choose between them. There’s been a trend towards more solid construction and better trackpads, along with higher prices.You can check out the different models at stores such as PC World and John Lewis, but there are many other suppliers. I’m linking to PC World partly because I did that myself on Tuesday.The main drawback with the HP Pavilion 14 and similar consumer laptops is that most of them have a standard Windows screen resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. But if this is what you’re used to, you probably won’t mind.One of the advantages of buying a Dell business laptop – not an Inspiron – is that you can add next-business-day on-site service for a low price. For example, you could get a 14in Vostro 5471 from Dell’s small businesssoho range with a Core i5-8250U8GB256GB spec for £579 plus delivery and VAT. You could then add four years of collect-and-return service for £50.36, or four years of on-site service for £95.14. I’ve used this service in the past, and have it on my current Dell desktop. I can confirm that having someone turn up on your doorstep to fix things is fantastic value for 46p a week.The Vostro 5471 with the spec mentioned, four years of ProSupport Plus and on-site service, VAT and delivery currently comes to £885.05. It busts your budget, but if you are used to getting good IT support, it’s probably worth it.Bear in mind that you can also buy HP laptops direct and add three years of pick up-and-return service for £79 or less. If you like the HP Pavilion 14, you can get a 14-bk002na with 4GB and a Full HD (1920 x 1080-pixel) screen for £429, or a silver Pavilion x360 14-ba007na with 8GB and a 1366 x 768 screen for (flash sale) £449.10. Both these laptops have Core i3-7100U processors and 128GB SSDs.Most Pavilion 14 laptops have two memory slots, so you should be able to expand a 4GB system to 8GB, but check before buying. Their usual maximum memory is 16GB.Most refurb buyers are looking for cheap machines, typically under £250. In your case, you could get a high-end laptop – the latest X1 Carbon starts at £1,439.99 – within your budget.Refurbs are available from many other websites including Laptop Outlet and Dell Outlet, as well as on Amazon and eBay. As long as you go for a decent spec, they should do what you need.Have you got a question?

This week Hawaii took action on the issue, passing a bill that will make it the first US state to ban sunscreens that are harmful to coral reefs. If subsequently signed by state governor David Ige, the ban will come into place in January 2021.The bill focuses on two chemicals – oxybenzone and octinoxate – that are found in many sunscreens and notes that they “have significant harmful impacts on Hawaii’s marine environment and residing ecosystems”. It indicates that high levels of these chemicals have been found at popular swimming beaches and reef areas, including Waimea Bay, Hanauma Bay, and Waikiki Beach on Oahu and Honolua Bay and Ahihi-Kīnau natural area reserve on Maui.A study in 2015, published in the journal Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, found the chemicals have a range of effects on coral, including mortality in developing coral, bleaching of coral and genetic damage to coral and other organisms. It also found both chemicals can induce feminisation in adult male fish and increase reproductive diseases in creatures from sea urchins to parrotfish and mammal species similar to the Hawaiian monk seal. The chemicals can also induce neurological behavioural changes in fish and have possible impact on the many endangered species found in Hawaii’s waters, including sea turtles.The study found oxybenzone had a toxic effect at a concentration of 62 parts per trillion – equivalent to one drop in six-and-a-half Olympic-size swimming pools.“This is the first real chance that local reefs have to recover,” said Craig Downs, a scientist whose 2015 peer-reviewed study found oxybenzone was a threat to coral reefs. He found up to 14,000 tonnes of sunscreen lotion ends up in coral reefs each year. “Lots of things kill coral reefs but we know oxybenzone prevents them from coming back.”Critics of the bill have argued that it’s just a “feel-good measure”, pointing out that other factors pose equally significant threats to coral, such as global warming and coastal development. The American Chemistry Council opposed the bill on the basis that sun exposure to humans is also a danger.Reef-friendly sunscreens are already available. Edgewell Personal Care, which makes Banana Boat and Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen lotions, said it makes products free of the two chemicals. The company “will continue to ensure we comply with all relevant regulations concerning oxybenzone and octinoxate”.In April, Hawaiian Airlines partnered with RAW Elements USA, to offer complimentary samples of its reef safe sunscreens to its passengers. Authorities in other marine park locations – such as the Virgin Islands, south Florida and destinations in Mexico – have already been taking measures to encourage visitors to use sunscreens made with biodegradable chemicals such as zinc oxide and titanium oxide.

A TV show that outperforms its movie inspiration can be a rarity – the myriad Marvel spinoffs seem largely content to settle as inferior versions of the big screen blockbusters, and shows that lean too heavily on nostalgia tend to collapse under the weight (see the gossamer-thin Scream, for example, though I have a soft spot for the sitcom version of Clueless). But other shows are improvements on the feature length versions that came before them, using the extra space and length to explore aspects that may have been pushed to one side.Peter Berg based his 2004 movie of the same name on a non-fiction work by HG Bissinger, which told the story of the Permian Panthers, a high school football team in Odessa, following them for one season in 1988. The movie tweaked real life events to add dramatic dazzle, and it’s an excellent sports film, that rare kind that makes sport watchable even for those who don’t know their block from their blitz. But Berg has said that in translating the story to the big screen, he had to put the book’s focus on social issues away, and that even when making the film, he realised that television would allow him the space to do that. The show, which ran for five seasons from 2006 to 2011, succeeded in making a drama ostensibly about sports, but really about family, community and society, creating the fictional town of Dillon for its Panthers to call home. It may have lacked Billy Bob Thornton, but it made stars out of Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton.Joss Whedon had what he called “major involvement” in the original 1992 film version of his teenage superhero, for which he had written the script. While it’s fun to watch in retrospect as a kitschy early 90s relic, it appears that Whedon’s vision was twisted out of shape by Hollywood’s dark forces. “It didn’t turn out to be the movie I had written,” he has said. By the time it reappeared on the small screen, five years later, it was clear that it would be everything the film should have been: wry, witty and inventive, exploring teenage life (and eventually adulthood) through that tragicomic supernatural filter. It always exists slightly outside of the “golden age of TV” boxset canon, perhaps because it lacks “serious drama”, HBO-ish credentials, but it’s certainly one of the most loved shows of all time, and for many, one of the best.Though there are surface similarities between the Starz series and the 2009 Steven Soderbergh film from which it took its title – both are about an escort named Christine, both explore the service-industry economics of sex work, and both have proven isive – the TV show proved to be a bold and accomplished curiosity. (The first season, that is, rather than the odd, disjointed second.) Riley Keough’s turn as Christine, a trainee lawyer who begins a sideline in escorting, is extraordinary, and Amy Seimetz and Lodge Kerrigan have turned the vicious, icy world of corporate law into a blithely nightmarish trap of claustrophobic boardrooms and anonymous hotel rooms. It’s an unusual and demanding show that’s more arthouse than blockbuster, and it greatly improves upon what Soderbergh came up with. Michael Crichton directed his own story in 1973. His vision of a historical theme park populated with robots who are infected with a virus that causes them to turn against human visitors has aged surprisingly well, considering the movie sets its future in 1983. It contained a kind of prescience about technology and development that made it a natural choice for a 21st century reboot. While some find HBO’s big-budget reimagining to be slow and overly complicated, the expanse of the small screen perfectly suits the magnitude of the story, and allows it room to develop beyond a cautionary horror story. Roman world and medieval world are yet to make an appearance in the show, but it’s been so successful that such growth seems inevitable. It might seem a stretch to argue for the full superiority of Fargo the TV show to Fargo the movie, which is pretty close to cinematic perfection. So rather than calling it an improvement, it might be better to think of it as an equal partner. Plenty of series have attempted to rework hit films for the small screen, and plenty have fallen into the trap of relying too heavily on viewers’ nostalgia and good will. But Fargo works hard to live up to its name, taking the feel and template set by its impeccable forebear and adapting it to a new format with elegance. Its three seasons so far have often felt like elongated movies, not least because of the star power they’ve commanded."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc37255fbdb17d2530df78adaaf2670a11334731/0_157_4688_2812/master/4688.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=958b7d9e091bbbd4db4e00046d4c8b2e","title":"eu plans to retain westminster offices former tory hq","story":"Exclusive: European parliament and commission to keep UK outpost at former Conservative HQThe EU plans to defy Tory Brexiters and retain its offices in London – the former Conservative central office at 32 Smith Square – as an outpost from which to communicate with British citizens after Brexit, leaked documents reveal.High-profile Brexiters had called last year for the EU to hand back the large red-brick building that was previously Margaret Thatcher’s headquarters and the scene of her general election victories.The European commission and the European parliament jointly purchased the Westminster building for £20m in 2010 after 50 years of Tory ownership, and renamed it Europe House.Jacob Rees-Mogg MP, the chairman of the European Research Group, had suggested it would be a “wonderful” gesture of goodwill if, during the negotiations over the UK’s £39bn orce bill, the building was returned.But a leaked note on the administrative consequences of Brexit, seen by the , makes clear that the EU is keen to retain the advantages of the building and its plum position close to the houses of parliament in Westminster.Klaus Welle, the European parliament’s secretary general, said the EU would need a position from which to champion the interests of its own citizens living in the UK, and to communicate its messages to the British. The EU’s office in Scotland was established close to Edinburgh Castle in 1975, the year of the UK’s first referendum on the then EEC, in order for Brussels to build contacts with local politicians. The office in London comprises eight floors and has an area of approximately 34,000 square feet. “Although the UK is set to become a third country, as a former member state with many links to the EU, it nonetheless – and whatever the outcome of the negotiations – will remain a special and essential partner of the union. Most notably, as of now, more than 3 million non-British EU citizens reside in the United Kingdom,” Welle said.“Both the London and Edinburgh offices offer unique advantages to particular parliament’s positions and serve as a vehicle for communicating with citizens.”Welle continues: “The House of Europe in London is moreover ideally suited to host a wide range of external events, thanks to its location and meeting facilities, which may also serve as a means of engaging with civil society in the international setting that London will undoubtedly remain.Welle’s note says, however, that the European parliament will have to examine its contracts with British suppliers when the UK withdraws from the EU.While the ongoing Brexit negotiations might provide further clarity, he writes: “The handling of contracts of parliament with British companies that will be in force when Brexit becomes effective is a further area of interest.“One might have to analyse also contracts concluded with subsidiaries of British companies located in EU member states, such as the internet and voice data supply contractor of parliament ... A process of continuous legal and operational analysis has been initiated by the secretary general in the legal service, on the basis of a screening exercise.”In January 2016, BT announced two new contracts with the European commission worth £24m to deliver public and private cloud services across 52 major European institutions, agencies and bodies – including the European parliament, the European council and the European Defence Agency.The Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder said: “Brexit is bad for British companies doing business anywhere in the EU.“At the moment British companies have the right to tender for EU contracts – that will be lost when we leave.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7f7d3fa34310bf3541115356419d4abd7a83017/0_202_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff603cf99083f44f5321553d84a95e96","title":"my whole life has been a lie sweden admits meatballs are turkish","story":"Turks don’t mince their words as they relish news that Ikea’s famous dish is not SwedishTurks have reacted with undisguised glee to what many have described as an official – and certainly long overdue – confession from Stockholm that Sweden’s signature national dish is, in fact, Turkish. “Those famous Swedish meatballs you get in Ikea are actually Turkish, admits Swedish government,” tweeted TRT World, Turkey’s publicly funded international television news channel. “Swedish meatballs originally Turkish dish: Swedish government,” said the headline in Hürriyet Daily News, after Sweden’s official national Twitter account, @swedense, came clean last weekend.“Swedish meatballs are actually based on a recipe King Charles XII brought home from Turkey in the early 18th century,” the Swedish account revealed abruptly and for no immediately apparent reason. “Let’s stick to the facts!”Turkey’s Anadoly agency seized the chance to speak to Annie Mattson, of the literature department at Uppsala University, who confirmed that after losing a key battle against Russia in 1709, Charles and the remnants of his army took refuge in what is now Moldova, then part of the Ottoman empire. Once known as “the Lion of the North” and “Swedish Meteor” for his early military prowess, Charles, who acceded to the throne in 1697 at the age of 15, had bitten off rather more than he could chew by taking on Russia, and spent the following six years in exile in and around present-day Turkey.Having acquired a taste for the local cuisine, he returned to Sweden in 1714 with the recipe not just for köfte, the spiced lamb and beef meatballs that in time became the Swedish staple köttbullar, but also for the popular stuffed cabbage dish now known in Sweden as kåldolmar.In Turkey’s meatball capital, Inegöl, this week, a local chef, İbrahim Veysel, told the Dogan news agency it was an honour that the Turkish dish should have become “an example to different cuisines all over the world”.Others were less happy. Serdar Çam, president of the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency, complained that Ikea, which sells 2m meatballs a day in its in-store restaurants, should not be selling the dish as though it were Swedish.And one forlorn – though presumably tongue-in-cheek – Swede lamented that the news had robbed life of its meaning. “My whole life,” he tweeted, “has been a lie.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3482048.1525296876!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cervicalcheck 10 year timeline","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHSE director general Tony O’Brien: there are 10 active legal claims in relation to the CervicalCheck audit controversy.  Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill2008: CervicalCheck – a national cervical screening programme is set up as “a quality-assured, organised and population-based screening programme” to provide free cervical screening to women aged 25 to 60. The CervicalCheck women’s charter says the service is “committed to providing a safe and reliable service to women”. The National Cancer Screening Service awards the contract to analyse 300,000 Irish smear tests a year to US firm Quest Diagnostics.2010: Clinical Pathology Laboratories, based in Austin, Texas, wins the contract to provide laboratory services for CervicalCheck. Two laboratories in Ireland also have similar contracts.2011: Limerick woman Vicky Phelan attends CervicalCheck for a routine smear test and wrongly receives the all-clear. 2014: An audit of smear tests reveals to health service professionals that Ms Phelan had wrongly received the all-clear, but she is not told about it. Having sought medical assistance on her own initiative, Ms Phelan is diagnosed with cervical cancer. She undergoes an aggressive form of radiation and chemotherapy and eventually gets the all-clear.2017: Ms Phelan had been cancer-free for almost three years until a routine scan in November reveals the cancer is back.September 2017: Ms Phelan learns that her cancer was missed through a chance reading of her medical file while waiting for an appointment. Wednesday, April 25th, 2018: Ms Phelan settles a High Court action against Clinical Pathology Laboratories for €2.5 million with no admission of liability. The money will allow her trial new drugs and may extend her life, she says. Friday, April 27th: Minister for Health Simon Harris says he does not have confidence in the management of the CervicalCheck programme. The HSE says it now knows a review was warranted in 442 cervical smear cases and more than 200 cervical smear results should have resulted in earlier intervention. It was revealed that Dr Gráinne Flannelly, the clinical director of CervicalCheck, told Limerick gynaecologist Dr Kevin Hickey in a July 2017 email that several women should not be told about false negative tests discovered in an audit and that the doctor should “simply file” the audited test results in the patients’ medical files.Saturday, April 28th: A helpline opens for concerned women. By 1.30pm it receives more than 600 calls. More than 2,000 people contact the Health Service Executive’s CervicalCheck programme over the weekend. Former master of the Rotunda Hospital Sam Coulter-Smith says he warned the government a decade ago against testing being moved to private companies overseas, because he was worried that resulting problems would mean cancer cases being missed.Monday, April 30th: David Gibbons, the former chair of the cytologyhistology group within the quality assurance committee of the National Cervical Screening Programme, says he had resigned over outsourcing the analysis of smear tests to the US. Dr Gibbons says he resigned after his warnings were ignored. He says figures from the US showed a one-third lower detection rate of high-grade dysplasias (pre-cancerous cells) compared to Irish labs, with a “mismatch” of systems because Ireland tests for cervical cancer every three years while the US tests smear samples annually. He said he made his concern known to HSE chief Tony O’Brien.Tuesday, May 1st: Simon Harris tells the Dáil an additional 1,500 women who have cervical cancer did not have their earlier negative smears rechecked. He also suggests the Government may set up a commission of investigation into the affair.Wednesday, May 2nd: HSE chief Tony O’Brien reveals there are 10 active legal claims in relation to the CervicalCheck audit controversy. Legal proceedings have commenced in six cases.

He is due to leave the HSE in July. It is understood there was contact between Minister for Health Simon Harris and Mr O’Brien this morning and an agreement for him to step down was reached.Mr O’Brien’s position in Evofem entitles him to annual fee of $65,000 and share-buying options up to $450,000 in his first three years with the company.There has been renewed calls for him to stand aside from his position due to the ongoing controversy over the CervicalCheck controversy.It has emerged following a High Court case taken by terminally ill Limerick woman Vicky Phelan (43) that scores of women with cervical cancer were not told that smear test results showing them to be in the clear were in fact inaccurate and the revised test results were kept from them for years.Ms Phelan who was diagnosed with incurable cervical cancer last year. The diagnosis followed a false negative result from a cervical smear which was tested in 2011.The Government is to establish a non-statutory inquiry to provide immediate answers to the CervicalCheck controversy before deciding if a commission of investigation is required.Sinn Féin deputy leader Pearse Doherty said Mr O’Brien’s decision to stand aside from the board did not go far enough. He said the move “only goes to show the inappropriateness of the health minister’s sanctioning the board appointment”.Tánaiste Simon Coveney said Mr O’Brien “can be of most use to the women of Ireland if he focuses now on the most important” role of establishing the facts in the cervical smear controversy.He said Mr O’Brien would focus on making a positive contribution to the work that needed to be done in relation to the cervical cancer screening controversy.Mr Coveney said Irish women had been badly let down and that there was a real sense of anger and frustration within Government at what had happened and how.There had been “ a disgraceful breach of trust between thousands of women and the State”, he added. Mr Coveney twice did not respond to Mr Doherty when pressed as to whether or not he had confidence in Mr O’Brien. However, he pointed out that the clinical director of CervicalCheck had resigned and the director of the service had stood aside.“This is about accountability, providing full information, responsibly, comprehensively to a disgraceful breach of trust,” Mr Coveney added.Mr Doherty said that Mr O’Brien did not have to be in place for him to co-operate with the inquiry set up to investigate.He added that Ms Phelan had said that “heads absolutely need to roll, especially Tony O’Brien’s” and had criticised his refusal at the Oireachtas health committee meeting to accept full responsibility “for the cock-up”.“This is so serious. We don’t need an inquiry to know it happened on Tony O’Brien’s watch,” Mr Doherty said. “We cannot allow Tony O’Brien to walk off into the sunset with his pension in six weeks time without accountability”.Mr Coveney said that no one should doubt that there would be full accountability following an independent process led by international experts.Separtely, the woman who brought the CervicalCheck controversy to light has called for a public commission of investigation to look into how cancer patients have been treated by the health service.Vicky Phelan said an urgent and prompt investigation was required and that there has already been too much secrecy around the issue.“As the woman who exposed this scandal, I want to see a Commission of Investigation that is both urgent and prompt but also PUBLIC. Too much has already happened behind closed doors,” Ms Phelan tweeted on Thursday morning.She also said Mr O’Brien should step down over the scandal.“Heads absolutely need to roll, in particular Tony O’Brien’s,” she said.Speaking before an Oireachtas committee on Wednesday, Mr O’Brien said he would not stand down. While recognising his organisation had made mistakes, Mr O’Briensaid he didn’t personally “cock up” so he would not take responsibility for it.It was agreed a person from outside the State would be appointed to conduct a “scoping exercise” to answer the immediate questions including how many women are affected, how many should been informed of a delay in their diagnosis and the level of knowledge within the health service of the extent of the issue.The inidual will be asked to examine if a commission of inquiry is warranted and to decide the possible terms of reference for such an inquiry.A preliminary inquiry will report back in a number of weeks, he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. “Let’s see what they say.”He also expressed concern that more cases may be uncovered. If there are other cases that have been settled and not disclosed by the HSE and the Department of Health that would mean they had not been “fully candid” with the Oireachtas Committee and “that would be very worrying indeed.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481694.1525330729!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"karl marx s insights retain their clout and relevance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA statue of German philosopher, economist, political theorist and sociologist Karl Marx is placed on its plinth in his birthplace of Trier, Germany. Photograph: Harald TittelAFPGetty His view over Brussels’s magnificent Grand Place from La Maison du Cygne was a vivid architectural representation of what he was trying to write. History as class struggle.The tall gothic and baroque guild houses, an expression of the rise to pre-eminence of the merchant bourgeoisie, and the town hall spoke of municipal power and wealth. And surrounded by a city teeming with the poor and hungry . . .An impoverished Karl Marx, barely 30, spent three years here from 1846.And in the back room of what is now one of Brussels’ most chic restaurants, with friend Friedrich Engels, he laboured over their most important work, The Manifesto of the Communist Party, part-groundbreaking philosophical and historical thesis, but above all a call to action that would reverberate around the world.Two hundred years ago next Saturday, Marx was born in the small German town of Trier, where EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker will deliver a speech for the birthday unveiling of a 5.5m statue of the local boy, a gift from the People’s Republic of China.“Nobody can deny that Karl Marx is a figure who shaped history in one way or the other,” a commission spokeswoman defensively insisted. “Not speaking about him would come close to denying history.”His intellectual legacy is everywhere. Last week with a laugh, a senior Irish diplomat described to me the “mao dun” – Chinese for “internal contradiction” – at the heart of a commission proposal. Doomed, he was suggesting, like capitalism and its contradictions, to the dustbin of history.Neither Juncker nor my diplomat, you may be relieved to hear, are closet Marxists, but in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 , they, like many others, economists, historians and philosophers, have been willing to look again seriously at the ideas of a man at whose door most of the 20th century’s woes have been unfairly laid by conventional opinion.And yet. No more than the bloody crusades, or the terreur and the guillotine can be said definitively to characterise Christendom or the French Republic,\u0026nbsp Marx too can and must be rescued from his disciples’ excesses and intellectual rigidities. “If anything is certain,” he would claim to “revolutionary phrase-mongering” adherents, “it is that I myself am not a Marxist.”Rescuing Marx is first and foremost about rescuing his thinking from the charge – a caricature – of dogmatism and rigidity. On the contrary, it is above all a methodology of thinking and analysis, not a fixed position, not a political programme, nor a set of explicit prescriptions for the world’s ills.One that explores the dynamics of constant change in the economic, political and ideological spheres as the working-out of contradictions. In Marx’s view, these are the tensions between old ways of creating the means of survival, and their social organisation, and new, emerging forms of economic and political organisation. Irreconcilable opposites in whose synthesis the new world is created.But for Marx, and his “historical materialism”, history itself was inherently open-ended: “All history is nothing but a continuous transformation of human nature.”“In Marx’s vision, which cannot recognise anything as absolutely final,” the late philosopher István Mészáros wrote, “there can be no place for a utopian golden age, neither ‘round the corner’ nor astronomical distances away. Such a golden age would be an end of history, and thus the end of man himself.”It was not Marxists who announced “the end of history” on the fall of the Soviet Union, supposedly the triumph of capitalism as the highest and unsurpassable civilisation. Such finality is absurd to them.Marx’s analysis and insights have made much of modern sociology and shaped political and historical theory. Gender theory, race theory, and new insights into humanity’s ecological death wish, have all added to and deepened his insights into the exploitation that drives capitalismEven right-wing economists nod at his critique of the market. The jury may still be out on whether, as he predicts, there is an inevitable tendency for the rate of profit to fall.But, most recently, in a powerful dissection of the data on wealth concentrations and distribution over the last 250 years, French economist Thomas Piketty convincingly linked growing global inequality to the fact that the rate of capital return in developed countries is persistently greater than the rate of economic growth. In other words, as Marx predicted, under capitalism the rich will get richer and the poor, poorer .“The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point is to change it,” Marx wrote in 1845. And the view of the cobbled square from the Maison du Cygne remains. Unchanged."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481984.1525297392!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"house of lords backs move to prevent hard border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer first minister of Northern Ireland David Trimble:   said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London. Photograph: Matthew LloydGetty ImagesBritain’s House of Lords has backed a move to prevent a hard border after Brexit under which no new checks or controls could be imposed without the agreement of the Irish Government. Peers voted by 309 to 242 in favour of the amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which was proposed by former Conservative minister and EU commissioner Chris Patten. It says Brexit must not diminish any form of North-South co-operation or create or facilitate Border arrangements featuring any new infrastructure, checks or controls without an agreement between London and Dublin. Lord Patten said the amendment reflected prime minister Theresa May’s stated policy, which was under pressure from hardline Brexiteers, and he rejected the charge that raising fears about a hard border was playing with fire.“I will tell you what I think playing with fire is: blundering into the politics of Northern Ireland with a policy which is sometimes clueless and sometimes delinquent with a can of petrol in one hand and a box of matches in the other. That is playing with fire. That is what we are in danger of doing,” he said.Former first minister David Trimble was one of a number of former unionist politicians to speak against the amendment, suggesting that Brussels and Dublin were seeking to change the way Northern Ireland was governed.“The drive is there to get Northern Ireland into a special situation: linked permanently to the European Union and with the union with the rest of the United Kingdom to that extent weakened,” he said.Lord Trimble said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London, which had improved dramatically since the Good Friday Agreement.“They have been extremely good and I am delighted, but the behaviour at the moment of the Irish prime minister and Coveney, backed up by the European Union, is actually destroying that relationship and doing considerable damage to it,” he said.Wednesday night’s vote, in which 19 Conservative peers supported the amendment, was the 10th defeat the Lords have inflicted on the government during the passage of the EU Withdrawal Bill.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481967.1525291648!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish border centre stage at westminster and in eu negotiations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDavid Trimble was one of a number of speakers in the House of Lords who complained that Dublin and Brussels were engaging with only one community in Northern Ireland. Photograph: Peter MorrisonAP PhotoWednesday’s debate in the House of Lords about Brexit and the Border was an elegant affair, with Chris Patten and Northern Ireland minister Ian Duncan quoting lines from Louis MacNeice to one another and peers displaying elaborate courtesy as they argued. The debate underscored the central position the Border now occupies in the Brexit negotiations, and in Theresa May’s efforts to agree a common position with her ministers on future customs arrangements.The debate also exposed, however, the rawness which has entered into the atmosphere between London and Dublin and between unionist politicians and their counterparts in Dublin.Patten poked fun at Brexiteers who blamed Dublin for the impasse over the Border, and at David Davis’s theory about who was pulling Leo Varadkar’s strings.“The secretary of state for exiting the European Union said that the problem was because the leader of the Fine Gael party, the Taoiseach, was in the pocket of Sinn Féin. Sinn Féin and Fine Gael – I think the secretary of state must have been away the day they did Irish history at school,” he said.But former Alliance leader John Alderdice said the idea of a coalition between Fine Gael and Sinn Féin was not such a fanciful one and historian Paul Bew agreed, pointing to an email exchange between the Taoiseach’s office and Sinn Féin “showing an intimacy of spirit which nobody would have believed possible from a Fine Gael government”.David Trimble was one of a number of speakers who complained that Dublin and Brussels were engaging with only one community in Northern Ireland, suggesting that making deals over the heads of the people was a greater threat to peace than Brexit.“If future arrangements are to be made over the Northern Ireland Border it is obvious that you have to have the people of Northern Ireland and their elected representatives closely involved in that. If not, you are going to make the same mistake,” he said.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481907.1525286901!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may postpones customs decision after ministers disagree","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg denied that Brexiteers had given Theresa May an ultimatum on customs arrangements with EU. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireTheresa May has postponed a decision on Britain’s future customs relationship with the European Union, asking officials to draw up revised proposals after her senior ministers failed to agree a common approach. The cabinet’s Brexit sub-committee met on Wednesday after Eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers called on the prime minister to abandon one of her two customs proposals.Reports after the meeting suggested that Ms May’s new home secretary, Sajid Javid, and defence secretary Gavin Williamson joined Brexiteer ministers to oppose the proposed “customs partnership”, which would see Britain collect tariffs on behalf of the EU. Ministers opposed to a hard Brexit, including chancellor Philip Hammond and business secretary Greg Clark, spoke in favour of it.The European Research Group (ERG) of 60 MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg dismissed the customs partnership as unworkable and urged the government to focus exclusively on a second option of a customs arrangement known as Maximum Facilitation or MaxFac, which would use technological and administrative measures to make customs controls less intrusive.Mr Rees-Mogg denied that the group was threatening to move against the prime minister unless she took the customs partnership off the table.“There is no question of there being an ultimatum. This is a paper that has been produced on a specific aspect of policy that would not work, that would not effectively take us out of the European Union. It would leave us de facto in both the customs union and the single market,” he told the BBCHousing minister Dominic Raab, who campaigned for Brexit, said\u0026nbspthose opposed to the customs partnership option appeared to be winning the argument.“I always keep an open mind on this because I do think when it comes to Brexit we are going to be forging a distinct path, the UK, not taking some off-the-shelf model. But I suspect actually in terms of delivering the two things that we need, which is to stay out of the customs union but also avoid the hard border as a matter of principle but also workability, at the moment the way I read it is that those in favour of max fac are winning the argument,” he said.At prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Ms May said there were “a number of ways” to deliver frictionless trade and avoid a hard Border in Ireland, fuelling speculation that the government is looking at a third option in an effort to unite the cabinet. Asked about the prime minister’s remarks, her spokesman said the government’s ideas on the customs relationship were evolving.“Work has been ongoing on two options that work has been proceeding. Ideas are obviously evolving as we go along the prime minister said there’s a number of options of ways to proceed,” he said.Labour’s Stephen Doughty, who supports a campaign for a second referendum on leaving the EU, said the government was negotiating with itself about customs options Brussels has already rejected, and the government’s negotiation with itself was going about as well as its negotiations with the EU.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“With less than six months to go before the final Brexit deal is supposed to be agreed, Ministers are still fighting among themselves about which of their two discredited customs proposals to persist with. Our European negotiating partners, who have for good reason already dismissed both proposals as unworkable, must be baffled as to what on earth the government wants,” he said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

He has tried it and says it tastes a bit like rabbit.His proposal, launched on his Facebook page, has caused a lively social media debate, with some people in favour of the idea and others revolted by the prospect of tucking it what looks like a cross-between a beaver and a large rat.“The debate about coypu has become bonkers, without coming to any resolution of the problem,” the 31-year-old mayor wrote.“Here’s my idea – let’s start eating them in restaurants and at village food festivals.”However unpalatable the idea, he insisted that he was not joking and said there were regions of Italy that were already warming to the idea of tucking into roast, broiled or braised coypu.“I’m totally serious. It’s true that there is a sense of revulsion towards the coypu but you just have to go into a pig farm to put it into context – everybody loves to eat prosciutto. We should at least start to discuss the idea.”The mayor said he was speaking from practical experience, having eaten coypu meat. “It’s almost better than rabbit,” he said.One enthusiastic backer of the idea wrote on social media: “Coypus are very clean animals and they are herbivores. I’ve tried them a few times. They should be cooked in a stew with onions or baked in the oven. I agree with the mayor – it’s better than rabbit.”Animal lovers were less enamoured of the idea. “Here’s another genius who thinks he can resolve a problem by killing defenseless animals. And they elected him mayor,” wrote one critic.Coypu – which are also known as nutria – have adapted well to a range of different habitats in Italy.A coypu on steps leading down to the Tiber River in the centre of RomeThey can even be seen in the middle of Rome, nibbling on sedges on the banks of the Tiber.They breed prolifically, with a female capable of giving birth to up to a dozen young at a time.No one knows how many coypu there are living wild in Italy.In the region of Emilia-Romagna alone there are believed to be around one million, while Lombardy has a population of around 1.3 million, with the regional government calling for 300,000 to be culled each year.In their native range they are eaten by alligators, large snakes and eagles.A lack of such predators in Europe has contributed to their rapid population growth.They have also colonised part of the United States, with 18 states reporting significant coypu populations.There, too, there is a debate over eating them. In Louisiana, where they have thrived in swamps and wetlands, the state’s wildlife and fisheries department suggests a range of recipes, from coypu fettucini and soup to coypu a l’orange.A website with the tag line “Can’t Beat’em, Eat’em,” enthuses that the furry rodents are “among the healthiest of meats to consume”.Please review our commenting policyHenry Vincent funeral: Tempers flare as man arrested and rocks are thrown after mourners swear out of windowsReleased after 43 years: Murderer who became one of Britain\u0026#39s longest serving prisoners is freedHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding on TV  Britain \u0026#39deeply concerned\u0026#39 by Palestinian president\u0026#39s Holocaust remarksIowa set to ban abortions after six weeks\u0026#39Social media has become weaponised\u0026#39: Lyse Doucet reflects on seven years of war in Syria Malaysian opposition leader investigated for \u0026#39fake news\u0026#39 after claiming plane was sabotagedArmed men abduct German nurse from Mogadishu Red Cross stationBreast cancer screening scandal: who is to blame for the error?Who is Rudy Giuliani?

However, it excludes retailers.Earlier this week, the April PMIs for manufacturing (10 per cent of the economy) registered a 17-month low for activity, while construction (6 per cent of output) was judged to be only “treading water at best”.The chancellor, Philip Hammond, attributed the sharp GDP slowdown in the first quarter to the severe snow storms of March, but the Office for National Statistics sought to downplay this explanation.Many analysts blame a combination of last year’s inflation spike and uncertainty from firms about post-Brexit trade arrangements for the UK’s underperformance relative to the US and the EU since the 2016 Brexit vote.However, there has been a slowdown this year in the eurozone too, with eurostat reporting on Wednesday that the 19-member currency bloc’s GDP grew by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter, down from a 0.7 per cent rate at the end of 2017.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

scowling celestial body annoyed that a rocket ship has crashed into its eye in A Trip to the Moon (1902), Melies was most recently seen in Martin Scorsese\u0027s film Hugo (2011) where he was played in old age by Sir Ben Kingsley.He was born in 1861, the son of luxury shoemakers who - after attending the prestigious Lycee Louis-le-Grand, completing military service and serving an apprenticeship as a clerk in London - shunned the family business to work as a conjurer at the Theatre Robert-Houdin in Paris.Here, Melies developed a fondness for stagecraft and visual effects, working with mechanical automata, trapdoors and lighting, eventually selling his boot factory shares to his brothers and buying the theatre outright. After seeing the Lumiere Brothers sensational moving picture camera in action in 1895, Melies rushed out to establish his own studio and began making films that featured clever illusions and tricks created by experimenting with double exposure, cutting and rewinding, building on his theatrical innovations.Using elaborate painted sets akin to those of Paris\u0027s music halls, Melies was a true pioneer who played a key role in the evolution of cinematic technique and the medium\u0027s storytelling grammar.He also had an acute sensitivity for the sort of blockbuster spectacle audiences would be attracted to.Specialising in horror and steam punk science fiction, taking inspiration from the fiction of late Victorian visionaries Jules Verne and HG Wells, his most famous film remains A Trip To The Moon, which starred acrobats and dancers from the Folies Bergere and the Chatelet ballet.As fantastic as this is, perhaps even more extraordinary is the later Tunnelling The English Channel (1907), in which he effectively predicted the advent of Eurostar and the Channel Tunnel.Other celebrated works including The Vanishing Lady, The Haunted Castle (both 1896), The Astronomer\u0027s Dream (1898), Bluebeard (1901), The Impossible Voyage (1904), The Merry Frolics of Satan (1906) and Baron Munchausen (1911).The aftermath of a cyclone in a short by Georges Melies (Getty)Tragically, after more than 500 short films, Melies\u0027s career collapsed with the onset of the First World War. He went bankrupt and was forced to sell his back catalogue to Pathe.An early setback had come when Melies planned to release A Trip To The Moon in America, only to find that Thomas Edison\u0027s representative Al Adabie had secretly copied a print of the film after bribing staff at a London cinema and had already released it in the US without permission - an early and particularly devastating case of film piracy.Later reduced to running a toy stall and selling sweets at Montparnasse train station in Paris (as depicted in Hugo), Melies became so embittered that he dug a hole in his garden, filled it with what remained of his priceless reels and memorabilia and burned it all.What was lost that dark day is almost too painful to think about.However, he did live long enough to see his films reassessed and acclaimed and to receive the Legion d\u0027Honneur before finally passing away in 1938.27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Amazingly, a colour print of A Trip To The Moon was unearthed in a French barn in 2002 in which each frame had been meticulously hand-painted by a large female work force a century earlier.The world greeted its restoration and re-release with the same excitement and anticipation of its premiere at a Paris fairground and the film continues to inspire affectionate parodies and homages in everything from the Smashing Pumpkins\u0027 video for Tonight, Tonight (1996) to Futurama (1999-2013) and The Mighty Boosh (2004-13).or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Photos of the happy couple are strewn around the walls: Jane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris Jane and Serge beaming into the camera on a lazy summer’s day, after a long, languid lunch. Jane looks beautiful, an English rose, the epitome of a carefree era when anything seemed possible. Serge looks incroyable, like a gargoyle or a goblin. No wonder the French press called him l’homme à tête de chou (the man with the head of a cabbage).From 1968 to 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg were Europe’s most glamorous creative couple. They could scarcely have been less alike. She was young and lovely, health and innocence personified. He was seedy and dishevelled, yet he oozed Gallic élan. They appeared together in movies and fashion shoots, but the thing that made them famous was the song they sang together, “Je T’Aime… Moi Non Plus” (I love you… neither do I).Gasinbourg wrote “Je T’Aime” for Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a brief romance in 1967. In 1969, he released the song with his new love, Jane Birkin. It was a Succès de Scandale, on account of Birkin’s contribution, in which she simulated the sounds of female arousal (20 years before When Harry Met Sally – quelle horreur!). If you’ve never heard it, it sounds awful – but, remarkably, it was a masterpiece. A conversation between two passionate, nihilistic lovers, it contained poetic pearls like “You are the wave – I am the island”, and Birkin’s heavy breathing, of course.Driving through Oxfordshire, on the road to Blenheim Palace in 1969“Je T’Aime” was condemned by the Vatican and banned from the radio in Britain and several Continental countries. France was a bit more enlightened. The song was played on the radio, but only after 11pm, and you had to be over 21 to buy the record. Even then, it was sold in a plain wrapper, like a porn mag or a blue movie. Naturally, this furore was wonderful exposure. A broadcast ban is fantastic for sales, giving a hit single a rebellious cachet that no amount of advertising can achieve. All these years later, “Je T’Aime” still stands proud in the pantheon of brilliant records banned by the BBC, from “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols to “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The record reached number one in Britain, and all across the Continent. Serge told Jane that the Pope was their greatest PR man. “He loved it!” she says, remembering Gainsbourg’s reaction to the controversy. He had a terrific appetite for mischief, and he knew no publicity was bad publicity.Jane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris 1969 - Andrew Birkin: Serge seemed to know the hidden underside of the photo shoot and, clearly better than me, the readers of Jours de France: nothing too subtle. We looked for the Oxford bus depot, which was deserted at the weekend, and bribed the caretaker to close his eyes while Serge sat in the driver\u0027s seat in the bright red double-decker bus, Jane at his side. Buying him a hot dog was the not-too-subtle but sufficient reward, before setting off for Oxford, a true place of learning.\u0026#131974 - Andrew Birkin: Serge received some good news from his agent... and bad news in a Sunday rag, which quoted him as saying: You\u0027re not my wife, darling... I love my freedom too much! . Black had always been my favourite colour: when I was at school, I had painted my bedroom walls black and I thought about doing the same in this hideous house I had bought in London. Serge stole a march on me by covering his recently purchased house in the Rue de Verneuil in black from floor to ceiling. \u0026#13On the road to Blenheim PalaceSerge entertaining Jane and Régine during a lunch party in 1969Photography by Andrew BirkinJane in 19691977 - Andrew Birkin: Jane had bought an old presbytery in Normandy, somewhere she could impose her own taste rather than always approving Serge\u0027s style. Serge\u0027s love for the countryside was short-lived and after just a few days, he was itching with the idea of returning to Paris... Or at least the idea of reviving himself with a “Marcel Proust” cocktail at the bar in the Grand Hôtel in Cabourg. \u0026#13Serge and Nana in 1977That was nearly 50 years ago, but the memories of that hedonistic era still burn bright, and now Birkin is revisiting that heady époque in a new show called Jane \u0026amp Serge here in Calais. It’s an exhibition of photos of the couple by her brother, Andrew Birkin, taken from the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Andrew is an eminent filmmaker (his biggest hit was his haunting film of Ian McEwan’s novel, The Cement Garden) and he has a director’s eye for drama. Andrew has always been close to Jane and he became close to Gainsbourg too. Consequently, these photos are incredibly intimate. Each frame preserves a particular mood, a unique atmosphere. They not only capture the essence of their relationship but the spirit of their age.Andrew is here too, for the opening of the exhibition, and he takes time out to show me and a few other hacks around. “He was a provocateur,” he says, of Serge. “He was always on.” This isn’t a criticism, merely a statement of fact. Twenty-seven years since Gainsbourg died, of a heart attack, aged just 62, Andrew’s deep affection for the legendary chanteur endures. “That streak of melancholy was one of his most attractive facets.”Half a century later, Jane Birkin is still striking – the same fine features half hidden beneath a cascade of tousled brown hair. The laugh lines around her almond eyes merely add to her allure, and her rich voice is full of joie de vivre. Although she left Gainsbourg in 1980, on account of his escalating alcoholism, they remained friends thereafter, united by the child they had together, the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she speaks of him with fondness, and admiration.Jane in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1969 – the archetypal English rose“Andrew was around on all our holidays – and all the rather bad films I did!” she recalls, looking at the photos of her younger self that surround her, reducing her to a pale replica of the image on the wall. “It’s a bit weird. You feel as if you’re dead.” Everyone laughs, but it’s not so funny. Her youthful fame has eclipsed her, leaving her public persona stranded in a time that’s long since passed.She still spends most of her time in France, and today she seems more French than English. Watching her being interviewed by French reporters, speaking fluent French, she seems more natural, more at ease. It looks like an admirable life, from a distance, but she’s had her share of sadness. Kate Barry, her eldest daughter, from her first marriage to the composer John Barry, died in Paris in 2013 after falling from a fourth-floor apartment.Jane left Serge for the French director Jacques Doillon, with whom she had another daughter, the actress and singer-songwriter Lou Doillon. She still sings, and last year she released an album of songs written for her by Serge – he wrote some of his finest songs about her after they’d parted. “Which, for me, are the most beautiful,” she says. “Everything on Baby Alone in Babylone, which was perhaps the best record I ever made.”That was two years after they’d split, and she’d already given birth to Lou, but the aura of their romance lived on in Serge’s songs. “I liked the ones after I left more, perhaps, because they were really about what he was feeling, and I felt it was deeper.” It felt emotional, singing them in front of him after a parting which caused them both such pain.What made him so significant as an artiste, I ask her. “He really rediscovered the French language,” she tells me. “That’s why I think every writer these days is bound to mention his name.” She likens him to Picasso, passing through so many styles. “He never repeated himself.”Jane and Serge in 1977, in the old presbytery that she bought in NormandyLike a true poet, he loved ambiguity. “There were always two meanings, and sometimes a third.” Yet he far preferred to simply call himself a songwriter. “He didn’t want to say he was a poet. He thought that was for Baudelaire and Apollinaire. The people he really appreciated were classical musicians.” He said that songwriting was a minor occupation. She found such modesty refreshing.Time’s up. Jane has another appointment. A French TV crew are waiting. I return to Andrew and his photos. “The problem with photography is that it starts to overwrite your memories of what you didn’t photograph,” he says. I think I know what he means. The more you look at these photos of his sister, the more unreal the real person becomes.Jane Birkin asks Hermès fashion house to rename luxury Birkin bagsSimon Price on Jane Birkin: Jane reignites her flame for SergeJane Birkin: \u0027I was no Lolita,\u0027 says Britain\u0027s BardotHowever Andrew has a very clear memory of his final meeting with Serge Gainsbourg, about six months before he died. “I bought him a 1910 bottle of Absinthe from Sotheby’s.” Andrew went to see him in his home in Paris, and they watched a film together. “He was asleep within five minutes of putting on the video, so I got up, crept out of the black house and into the black street and that was the last time I saw him.”In the end, it was the same old, sad old story. “The main problem with Serge is just that he became an alcoholic, and had no particular interest in stopping himself.” So what was the connection between his sister and the chanteur? I ask him. “Sex,” he says, and everyone laughs, but he then stops and thinks about it. “It was the attraction of opposites, in a way.”Jane \u0026amp Serge is at the Musée des Beaux Arts in Calais (calais.fr) until 4 Novemberor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Trees, for example, tend to stop growing outwards when they make contact with their neighbours’ branches.However, the mechanisms by which plants signal using touch are poorly understood, and Dr Ninkovic and his colleagues wanted to find out whether the answers could be found underground.In recent years scientists have begun to disentangle the complex communication system that links plants together. Science news in picturesScience news in picturesLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. \u0026#13Working in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. \u0026#13More than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.\u0026#13The storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together beforeA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits.

The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars.

Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.Unlike animals, plants do not have nervous systems and so cannot communicate using rapid electrical signals.Instead, their signalling both within their bodies and with neighbours consists of the relatively slow exchange of chemical messages.Some of this communication takes place via strands of underground fungi that plants use to share food, warning signals and even toxic chemicals – a phenomenon that some biologists have informally termed the “wood-wide web”.In the study by Dr Ninkovic and his colleagues, they wanted to investigate whether chemicals released directly into the soil by stressed plants could change the behaviour of their neighbours.Five plants and animals utterly confused by climate changeThe researchers began by applying a soft brush to corn seedlings, a touch that could represent any number of nearby stresses, including new plants encroaching on their territory or a plant-eating animal nibbling on their leaves.New seedlings were then transferred into the same growing material as the recently touched plants to see if their growth was affected – the theory being that plants touched by the brush would have left chemical traces in the soil documenting their experience.The scientists found that the fresh seedlings responded by growing more leaves and fewer roots than plants that had grown under normal conditions.They suggested that the corn seedlings, upon being exposed to the chemical signals of recently touched plants in the soil, were responding by preparing themselves for the trouble ahead posed by new neighbours or becoming something’s dinner.While they seem largely defenceless against outside attack, plants actually wield a variety of defensive strategies when targeted by hungry herbivores. Previous research has demonstrated that plants respond defensively to the sounds that caterpillars make when munching on their leaves – flooding them with unappetising mustard oil.Engineers have figured out a way to make plants glowTo confirm that their plants were capable of telling the difference between soil occupied by touched and untouched plants, the scientists gave some corn seedlings a choice about which medium they preferred to grow in.When placed near both, roots grew preferentially towards the growing solution that had previously contained untouched plants.These findings were published in the scientific journal PLOS One.The team suggested their results should be noted by other scientists when conducting experiments with plants, as even gently brushing a plant’s leaves has the potential to change how it and its neighbours behave.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Boris Johnson and Michael Gove also oppose itWith the overall balance of the cabinet six to five against the proposal, one source said Brexiteers now believe they have “killed” the option.Peers defeat government on plan for Irish border after BrexitUK police use EU system that may be lost post-Brexit 539m times a yearThe best Brexit deal does involve leaving the customs unionThis is why you should care about the local electionsAre countries really ‘queuing up for trade deals’ with Brexit UK?May ‘held hostage by extreme Brexiteers’ as customs decisions delayedBut in a sign that Ms May is not ready to let go of it, the prime minister asked for more work to be done on both of her existing proposals.The partnership plan would see Britain collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf at ports and airports, passing on a share of the money to Brussels – then if the UK sets different tariffs from the EU, traders would claim refunds from HMRC for goods that stay in Britain.Olly Robbins, Ms May’s Europe adviser, regards the partnership as a means of avoiding a hard border in Ireland, while keeping the UK out of the European customs union. Close aides of Ms May have also called it “intellectually perfect”.But Downing Street has been privately warned that the customs partnership proposal could collapse the government, with the Brexit-backing European Research Group having organised a critical report backed by 60 MPs.Boris Johnson: Northern Irish border being used to try and keep the UK in the customs unionThe group’s chairman, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has called the proposal “cretinous”, “deeply unsatisfactory” and argued that it would “not get us out of the European Union, which is what people voted for”.The other option, a “streamlined arrangement”, is viewed more favourably by Brexiteers in both the cabinet and on the back benches.It is known as “maximum facilitation”, or even “max fac”, and would see the UK outside any customs union, but with some controls at the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.Backers say a “trusted trader” scheme and remote monitoring of the border would limit physical infrastructure.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

First of all, there isn’t a lot of evidence that signing new free trade agreements (FTAs) would deliver an economic boost anything like enough to compensate for the hit from leaving the EU single market and customs union. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says “simple arithmetic” and “a basic understanding of trade” show the gains from such FTAs are likely to be small.But another problem is that countries aren’t exactly queuing up to do deals with Britain – or where they seem to be, things aren’t as straightforward as they appear.The US president has been enthusiastic about a trade deal (AP)Donald Trump has said he wants a “big and exciting” trade deal with the UK, which sounds promising. In reality, however, the price of such a trade deal could be so high as to be unworkable. A previous US-EU attempt at a trade deal, called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, failed after Mr Trump suspended negotiations because it wasn’t favourable enough to the US. But on this side of the Atlantic, even that deal was equally controversial because of US stipulations on scaling back welfare and hygiene rules for farm animals, as well as opening up public services like the NHS to US private corporations.With polling showing the public firmly against US foodstuff such as chlorinated chicken coming to Britain, any deal likely to be acceptable to Mr Trump would be sure to contain extremely unpopular and controversial elements – particularly if it were to be negotiated at speed.The UK has a huge trade deficit with China, the workshop of the world (Reuters)China’s approach to post-Brexit trade has been cautious, despite multiple visits from senior British politicians to pay their respects and drum up support.The country’s envoy to the EU, Zhang Ming, has specifically said that China would not open trade negotiations with Britain if the UK did not manage to conclude a withdrawal agreement with the EU – which some Brexiteers are pushing for.President Xi Jinping called for a “golden era” of relations before Britain voted to leave the EU, but enthusiasm has been less obvious since the referendum. Following Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, Liu Xiaoming, China’s ambassador to the UK, warned Chinese firms operating in the UK they should now take “precautions” – widely interpreted as coded support for the defeated Remain campaign. Japanese car firms have invested heavily in the UK in recent decades (AFPGetty)Japan has been among the most vocally negative about Brexit and explicitly said it would prioritise the EU for trade deals over Britain.The country, which reportedly sees Brexit as an act of “self-harm”, said doing a deal with the EU – which would now not apply to Britain – would be “first and foremost a priority” over negotiating anything with the UK, according to its diplomatic minister.Japanese companies are particularly concerned about the UK’s exit from the single market and customs union, which is seen as important for industries like carmaking, which rely on frictionless trade set to come to an end under current government plans.Businesspeople from the country who met with Theresa May earlier this year told her openly that they would leave the UK if they could no longer make a profit under the new arrangement.Trudeau with May in Ottawa (AFPGetty)Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he wants a “seamless” trade deal with the UK – aiming to “flip over” a new agreement between Canada and the EU so that it still applies to Britain.This sounds positive, but there are three significant things to bear in mind. The first is that even if this goes well, there would be no gain for Britain – it would merely be replicating an existing trade deal that the UK already benefits from as an EU member.The second is that it may not be as simple as it sounds: little progress has been reported so far on issues such as what share of the EU’s quotas belongs to Britain. The third is that Canada is not a huge economy, equal to one of the larger 28 EU member states – its GDP sits roughly between Italy and Spain. British objections to sky high tariffs on Scotch whisky held back an EU-India trade deal (Getty)Yashvardhan Sinha, India’s high commissioner to Britain, has specifically said the country is not in a “rush” to do a trade deal with Britain after Brexit. India, whose economy is set to overtake Britain’s in size over the next few years, has been in trade talks with the EU for a trade deal since 2007.In fact, the country does see Brexit as an opportunity to do a deal – with the EU. Britain has been holding up a trade deal between India and the EU by opposing the more liberal immigration and visa regime sought by the South Asian country’s government. Another sticking point is the sky high tariffs on Scotch whisky imposed by India, which Britain would not accept as part of a deal.Despite a series of limited commercial agreement already inked between the two countries, both these obstacles would remain to a full UK-India deal after Brexit – indeed, Delhi has specifically said it wants visa liberalisation as a condition.British beef producers could face competition (Jo Turner)Mercosur is a South American trade bloc that includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay – which must be dealt with collectively for trade deal purposes because they’re in a customs union together.Brazil and Argentina have both expressed an enthusiastic interest in doing a possible deal with Britain – with the most notable outcome a flood of cheap South American beef into UK markets. That means lower prices for British consumers, though potentially difficult times ahead for this country’s beef producers.The South American bloc is already negotiating a separate trade deal with the EU, having relaunched stalled negotiations in May 2016 as the UK voted for Brexit. A trade deal with Britain might be more simple to conclude than one with the EU, however, because the UK has fewer and weaker agricultural interests than most European countries. The EU’s new trade deal with Mexico includes agricultural produce between the two blocs (Reuters)The European Union and Mexico reached an agreement on a trade deal in April of this year, getting rid of practically all tariffs. The deal is currently being finalised into a legal text. Trade secretary Liam Fox has said he wants to roll over this EU trade deal to keep its benefits after Brexit – but as with Canada’s EU deal, the process might not be straightforward, and there has been little reported progress so far.South Korea already has a trade deal with the EU (Alamy)South Korea is in a similar situation to Canada: the EU has a trade deal with the East Asian country already, and Britain wants to roll it over once it leaves to keep the benefits. As with the other countries in a similar situation, this will not be straightforward – but British business have notably raised concerns that South Korea in particular will ask for concessions and favourable terms from the UK to keep continuity. The Department for International Trade says it has “already held discussions with more than 70 countries” and insists “none have displayed any interest in disrupting trade flows, or in erecting barriers to trade that do not currently exist” – but trade experts are concerned that countries will use the UK’s situation to try to extract favourable terms.May gladhands Turnbull at Downing Street (Getty)Australia has been perhaps the most positive about a trade deal with the UK after Brexit. The country’s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he was “very keen” to do a deal with the UK “as quickly as possible”, in a joint press conference with Theresa May last year. Australia is, however, a relatively small player on the world stage, with an economy well out of the top 10 and roughly the size of Spain.Australia is also already negotiating a free trade deal with the EU, having opened preparatory talks with the bloc years ago – so Britain may not actually gain any new advantage from negotiating a separate agreement.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

remained in office following the referendum.\u0026nbspHe said people are fed up with how long Brexit is taking and suggested Mr Cameron should have stayed on as prime minister and\u0026nbspimplemented Article 50 himself.Mr Bone asked Brexit Secretary David Davis: Has the Secretary of State ever reflected on the fact that if David Cameron had kept his promise of after the referendum staying in office, implementing the views of the British people and triggering Article 50 immediately after the referendum, we would nearly be coming out of the EU now?And I, sir, would probably be arranging a statue to David Cameron in my constituency.He added: Does the Secretary of State get the feeling that the public are fed up of how long this process is taking and wish we could get on with it a bit quicker?Mr David Davis responded: Had we triggered Article 50 immediately after the referendum we would have had to absorb 40 years of European Union law into British law in an almost geological nanosecond, a very, very short time.It would not have been easy to do and although he is right about the departure date it might have been a lot more uncomfortable than it\u0027s going to be.Mr Bone\u0027s remarks follow an outburst during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions in which he hailed Theresa May the Brexit Queen.He joked that the prime minister would be carried shoulder high through the streets to the echoing of cheering crowds if she visited his constituency after Brexit.He also promised show her the sight where a statue to the Brexit Queen will be erected.This is from our deputy political editor, Rob Merrick, following this morning\u0027s Downing Street media briefing:\u0026nbspNo 10 has been defending the\u0026nbspattendance of Julian Smith, the chief whip, at the sub-committee which is deciding \u0026ndash at least in theory \u0026ndash the UK\u0026rsquos preferred option for post-Brexit customs rules.Mr Smith is not listed on the government\u0026rsquos website as attending, but turned up yesterday when \u0026ndash without his presence \u0026ndash Theresa May would have been outnumbered 6-5 on her preferred \u0026ldquocustoms partnership option.The prime minister\u0026rsquos spokesman said Mr Smith had attended several of its meetings \u0026ldquoin his capacity as chief whip as a \u0026ldquonon-voting member.However, he then conceded the sub-committee had never taken a vote, but instead made decisions \u0026ldquoby consensus \u0026ndash leaving reporters unclear how his role was different in any way.The spokesman would not say whether the sub-committee would meet again before next Tuesday\u0026rsquos full Cabinet meeting, which had been expected to finally settle on the preferred option.Brexiteers are confident they have, after yesterday, killed off the \u0026ldquocustoms partnership model, which they oppose as effectively keeping the UK in the EU customs union by the back door.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer asked if the customs partnership model with the EU is off the table after Cabinet ministers hit deadlock on the plans this week.Mr Davis replied: The first advice I\u0027d give to him is not to believe everything he reads in the papers, even about himself, let alone about me.Secondly, I mentioned earlier that the Government is spending some time, rightly, on making sure that we get absolutely the best outcome, which will preserve the United Kingdom without creating internal borders, and which will also deliver the best outcome in terms of both retaining the trade we have with the European Union and opening up opportunities to the rest of the world.That\u0027s why we\u0027re taking time to get this right.In total, more than 4,000 seats are being contested in around 150 councils in

The aircraft has been taken out of service, and our local Cleveland employees are working diligently to accommodate the 76 customers on a new aircraft to Newark, the airline said in a statement. Passengers said the emergency exit window shattered and pictures showed damage to the pane.A spokeswoman for Southwest said the aircraft never lost cabin pressure.She added that the pilots did not declare an emergency before landing and there were no other mechanical problems with the plane.A passenger who died after being partially sucked out of a Southwest jet window in April was the airline\u0027s first fatality, knocking the Dallas-based firm from its position as the safest airline in the world by passengers flown.She was named as Jennifer Riordan, a 43-year-old mother-of-two. The banking executive was travelling home to her family following a business trip when she was hit by shrapnel after the Boeing 737 blew an engine at 32,000ft on a flight from New York to Dallas.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

an experience he now considers a breakthrough - during which time he visited then-president-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower, an endorsement the latter was only too happy to accept.One of Kanye\u0027s more intriguing posts has been his expression of support for right-wing pundit Candace Owens:I love the way Candace Owens thinksMs Owens, who works as communications director for the conservative think-tank Turning Point USA, responded in kind:https:t.coUz1nB9K0OzCandace Owens is a controversial figure in America who has expressed opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement, suggesting the spoiled toddlers who comprise its membership foster a victim mentality.She has also attracted criticism in the past for branding the Women\u0027s March on Washington a joke.Kanye West and Candace Owens (GettyFox)Despite outrage at the mutual backslapping from many of Kanye\u0027s fans, he duly met with Ms Owens in California on 29 April in the company of Donald Trump Jr and her Turning Point colleague Charlie Kirk.Kanye said afterwards he hoped her influence would allow people to recapture freedom of thought while she in turn said she believed he had a wonderful, beautiful vision for the future of America.He previously expressed the same idea in a heated private phone call with radio\u0027s DJ Ebro, telling the host her example would help to de-programme people... to have people think differently than they have before.Candace Owens wrote this at the Office yesterday pic.twitter3utFm74k75Ms Owens, still just 28, was raised in Stamford, Connecticut, before graduating with a BA in Journalism from the University of Rhode Island and working for Vogue and as an administrative assistant in private equity.She subsequently founded the websites Degree180 and Social Autopsy, the latter intended to expose online trolls and bullying but proving controversial in practice and leading to accusations of harassment by doxing.She thereafter launched Red Pill Black in 2017, a YouTube channel in which she espouses right-wing political views targeted at an African-American audience, part of a growing movement in the US speaking up for black Republicanism and against complacent assumptions that African-Americans can be relied upon to vote Democrat.The likes of Chance the Rapper and Trump super-fans Diamond and Silk have aligned themselves similarly.Kanye West meets Donald Trump in ManhattanKanye West meets Donald Trump in ManhattanKanye West and President-elect Donald Trump speak with the press after their meetings at Trump Tower December 13, 2016 in New York.Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump speak with the press after their meetings at Trump Tower December 13, 2016 in New York.Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump speak with the press after their meetings at Trump Tower December 13, 2016 in New York.Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump speak with the press after their meetings at Trump Tower December 13, 2016 in New York.Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump speak with the press after their meetings at Trump Tower December 13, 2016 in New York.Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump speak with the press after their meetings at Trump Tower December 13, 2016 in New York.Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump speak with the press after their meetings at Trump Tower December 13, 2016 in New York.Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump speak with the press after their meetings at Trump Tower December 13, 2016 in New York.Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump speak with the press after their meetings at Trump Tower December 13, 2016 in New York.Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump speak with the press after their meetings at Trump Tower December 13, 2016 in New York.Singer Kanye West arrives at Trump Tower December 13, 2016 as US President-elect Donald Trump continues to hold meetings in New York.

The influence of Candace Owens, who has appeared on Alex Jones\u0027 conspiracy-minded InfoWars talk show, perhaps explains Kanye\u0027s slavery remarks in his interview with Charlamagne Tha God this week:We definitely are dealing with racism but I wanna push future concepts. That was the moment I wanted to use bitcoin, when I saw Harriet Tubman on a $20 bill. It\u0027s like when you see all the slave movies, it\u0027s like why you gotta keep reminding us about slavery? Why don\u0027t you put Michael Jordan on a $20 bill?When challenged that Tubman and Nat Turner led the opposition to slavery, the artist countered:I know this is gonna cause an uproar but certain icons are just too far in the past, they\u0027re not relatable, and that\u0027s what makes them safe. Like they\u0027ll let you go on the Grammys and talk about slavery and racism and all that because it\u0027s not talking about buying stock, it\u0027s not talking about buying property. It\u0027s not talking about economic empowerment.One of the many people troubled by the alliance between hip-hop\u0027s leading light and Candace Owens is Frank Ocean, the latter countering on Tumblr: I love the way Michelle Wolf thinks.​Mr Ocean appeared to be arguing that the comedian who caused such a furore with her acidic takedown of the Trump administration at the White House Correspondents\u0027 Dinner was the better role model, a gentle chiding of Kanye\u0027s inconsistent political outlook and bloated ego.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s. Mrs May, who knows the Home Office so well, will find that hard to take at times.But his appointment is a recognition that she isn’t any more in a position to dictate to her senior ministers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in my view, the Appeal Court was wrong.As a lifelong campaigner for LGBT rights, and as someone with gay friends in Northern Ireland who want to marry, I obviously strongly disagree with Ashers’ opposition to marriage equality.But in a free society neither they, nor anyone else, should be compelled by law to promote an idea they object to.These bakers didn’t turn away their gay customer – they gladly agreed to make Gareth a cake but declined to decorate it with the pro-gay marriage wording he wanted.As much as I deplore their opposition to marriage equality, Ashers should not be forced to promote same-sex marriage, given that it goes against their religious beliefs - nor should they be obliged to endorse a LGBT equality movement they do not agree with.This case doesn’t just affect the LGBT community it has wider, dangerous implications for the whole of Britain.If the Supreme Court insists that the bakery should be required to promote a pro-gay rights message that they find objectionable, this would presumably also mean that a Jewish publisher could be obliged to print a book that propagates Holocaust denial.Likewise, Muslim publishers (who believe that the Islamic prophet must never be depicted in art or drawings) could be legally pressured, against their will, to print the Danish cartoons of Mohammed that Muslims find deeply offensive.It could also encourage far right extremists to demand that businesses facilitate the promotion of their anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim opinions.Although most Christians in Britain now support same-sex civil marriage in register offices, the McArthur family, which owns Ashers bakery, does not.They say their faith requires them to oppose gay marriage and anything that endorses it.Using the law to force Ashers and others to aid the dissemination of ideas that conflict with their conscience sets a dangerous, authoritarian precedent.The equality laws invoked in this case are intended to protect people - not ideas - against discrimination.A business providing a public service, such as a bakery, has a legal duty to do so without discrimination based on a person’s race, gender, disability, faith, age, sexuality and so on. That is right and proper.But Ashers did not discriminate against the customer, Gareth Lee, because he is gay.His sexual orientation was not an issue – it is the message he wanted on the icing that is at the heart of this sticky moral dilemma.The logical consequence of the Appeal Court’s judgement against Ashers is that businesses cannot lawfully refuse a customer’s request to propagate a message, even if it is sexist, xenophobic or anti-gay - and even if the business owners have a conscientious objection to it.This case is different from the Christian B\u0026ampB owners who refused to accommodate a same-sex couple or the town hall registrar who refused to perform a gay civil partnership.Both were offering a public service but refused to provide that service to LGBT people. The courts found that they had discriminated unlawfully.Their refusals involved direct discrimination against people because they were gay.If the law rules against the bakery it will undermine the principle of freedom of expression, which includes the right to not support ideas you disagree with.Just reverse the roles and imagine that an anti-gay rights campaigner had asked for a cake with a homophobic slogan on it.I do not believe that a gay baker, or any baker, should be legally forced to decorate a cake with a message against LGBT equality.Discrimination against people is always wrong and is rightly unlawful.But in a democracy, it’s vital that people should be free to say no when asked to spread an idea they dont agree with.If they cant, the implications are frankly terrifying.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She made the mistake of posting pictures of herself wearing a red silk Chinese dress to her high school prom.One twitter-warrior complained: My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress. Another asked What’s the theme of your life? Ignorant”?And it was only a matter of time before Keziah was branded with the R-word! One troll asked, Was the theme of prom casual racism?Evidently, for social justice warriors, wearing clothes or costumes from another culture constitutes a crime that goes by the name of cultural appropriation.In recent times universities have become the hot-bed of the crusade against cultural appropriation.As a professor who has worked universities for many decades, I was taken aback by the speed with which a tiny group of cultural crusaders have succeed in gaining power over campus life.The rhetoric of cultural appropriation plays an important role in the performance of outrage. And everybody is at it.In some universities guidance is offered to students about what costumes they can and cannot wear on Halloween.Forget about organising a Latino themed party. On both sides of the Atlantic the wearing of sombreros by university students has been condemned as a cultural crime against Mexico.At one university, yoga classes were suspended because it might cause offence to Indians. A campaigner helpfully offered to change the title of the course to mindful stretching.Recently Oxford university decided to cancel a cannabis themed party amid concerns about cultural appropriation.Critics of this party encouraging guests to dress as pop-icons like Snoop Dogg or Shaggy claimed that the event would cause offence to minority students.Last month, students at Bristol University, who hosted a 21st birthday party themed A night at the Maharaja’s Palace, were denounced for committing a cultural crime. Critics were particularly galled by the sight of European students wearing glamorous Indian costumes.In recent years celebrities have become a favourite target of the culture police.White models and actresses, including Kim Kardashian, who wear their hair in cornrows are slammed for exploiting black culture.Iggy Azalea the Australian singer was attacked for rapping with a blaccent. Selina Gomez was crucified for wearing a bindi. Bruno Mars was accused of stealing black music.All celebrities – not just white – risk being accused of cultural appropriation.No sooner did Beyoncé appear portraying a Bollywood actress in Coldplay’s video Hymn for the Weekend, before the all too readily outraged social media warriors accused her of offending Indian culture.So what’s going on?Until recently people were delighted when those from another culture adopted their tastes and habits.Most civilisations - such as the Greeks, the Romans – praised foreigners who adopted their mode of dress, fashion, eating habits and customs.Throughout most of history the act of cultural appropriation was associated with enlightenment and progress.No one regarded hairstyles, costumes, music or indeed most cultural artefact as the sacred property of a chosen people.A civilised society is open to different cultural influences and is ready to share its own culture with others.Sadly, current crusade against appropriation turns every form of cultural interaction into a potential site for conflict.Even food has become the target of the culture police. Students no longer simply moan about the quality of food dished out in their canteens.At Pembroke College in Cambridge University, students condemned their institution for serving “culturally insensitive food” with “inauthentic combinations of ingredients”.Elsewhere complaints have been made about cooking fried chicken, Vietnamese sandwiches and sushi in a culturally inappropriate manner.Unwittingly the crusade against cultural appropriation serves to undermine the genuine multicultural impulses in our society.The policing of culture turns different cultural experience into no-go areas.Its ultimate objective is to build cultural fences and distance different people and ethnic groups from one another.Worse still, the policing of cultures creates a climate where the free and open attitude towards how people live their lives, decide what clothes they wear or what kind of hair-style they adopt becomes a highly charged political issue.If allowed to go unchecked, this horrible crusade will lead to cultural segregation.It will create a climate of hostility and suspicion were conflicts over who gets to decide what you can eat or wear becomes the new normal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the lowdown.Around 42 per cent of the seats being contested this year are in London, where all 32 boroughs have elections.Pollsters say London is now a Labour city with large numbers of young people and ethnic minorities.One borough Labour will be hoping to nick from the Tories is Kensington and Chelsea, where council leaders faced fury over the Grenfell Tower disaster.However the Tories have a 24-seat majority so a huge swing would be required for the authority to change hands.Labour are also targeting Barnet - which has been Tory since the 1960s - as well as Conservative strongholds Westminster and Wandsworth, and will hope to extend majorities in other boroughs they already hold.The Lib Dems are hopeful of keeping hold of Sutton, their last London council, and hope to seize Kingston from the Tories.Outside London, Labour is defending 75 councils and aims to gain control of more in towns and cities across England.That will be a key test of national opinion after Jeremy Corbyns surprisingly strong result in the 2017 general election.Ones to watch out for include Amber Valley, Trafford, Swindon and Tamworth which are all narrowly held by the Conservatives.Labour is also targeting councils currently under no overall control including Stockport, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Dudley, Walsall and North-East Lincolnshire.The demise of Ukip as a political force gives the Conservatives hope of making gains in areas that back Brexit.The Tories are seven short of a majority in unpredictable Thurrock, where 17 Ukip councillors all quit the party and are standing as independents.Theresa Mays party are also targeting Basildon, Colchester, Pendle and Portsmouth, where they lost control after a by-election last year.In London, Labour is on course for the best results by any party for 40 years, according to the latest YouGov survey for Queen Mary University of London.In Westminster the YouGov survey for The Times on May 2 shows 42 per cent of residents intend to vote for the Conservatives, 4 per cent more than those preparing to vote Labour.Jeremy Corbyns party has slipped three points since February but still leads the Conservatives by 51 per cent to 29 per cent.However Labour already dominate in London councils after large gains in 2014 and it is uncertain if the 22-point lead will be enough for them to snatch their target councils.They are forecast to remain runners-up in Westminster and Wandsworth.And though the stats predict a win in Tory stronghold Barnet, a large Jewish population could yet reject the party over the anti-Semitism scandal.Election expert Professor John Curtice said Theresa May could be spared humiliation as Brexit-led gains elsewhere in the country balance a drubbing in the capital.He said the Tories could pick up councils in key Leave-voting areas such as Peterborough, Rugby, Basildon and Pendle.He said: “Don’t be surprised if projected national vote share (based on Thursday’s results) has Tories ahead even if they have lost more seats in London.”In 2014 Labour, then led by Ed Miliband, gained 200 councillors and six councils, meaning they have more to lose and gains will be more difficult.Party elections boss Andrew Gwynne has admitted they wont get the massive boost that had been predicted until recently.This year some areas will see the first trials of councils requiring voters to show ID before casting their ballot.Scotland Yard is investigating 65 allegations of voting corruption in London, The Sun revealed. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jh-graphic-p10-eu.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"we dont need a customs union","story":"Behind closed doors in government and Parliament, two fierce battles are raging, and both are about Britain’s future trading relationships with the EU and the rest of the world.The first is about the decision ministers must make on the future customs relationship we establish with Europe after Brexit. The second is an attempt by MPs and peers — regardless of what ministers decide — to impose on the Government the very solution Theresa May has already rejected: they want Britain to form a customs union with the European Union.At first, this might sound appealing. It would mean no tariffs on goods traded between Britain and the EU, no routine customs checks at the border, and less hassle for firms doing business in Europe. But there are significant downsides. We would stay tied to the EU, because a customs union would mean having to sign up to European rules and regulations, over which we would have no say.And we would be unable to sign our own trade agreements with other countries, so we would not make the most of one of Brexit’s key advantages.But a customs union with the EU — when we are no longer members of the EU — brings an even bigger problem.It would allow the European Commission, in its own negotiations, to give away trading access to Britain without getting the same access to other countries for our firms.This is what they do to ­Turkey, which is the only big country to agree even a partial customs union with Europe. The Turks are not allowed to negotiate trade agreements with other countries unless the EU has reached its own deal first.European negotiators surrender access to the Turkish ­market, but do not even try to win market access for Turkish companies. When Turkey tries to conclude its own deals, it has nothing to rely on but the generosity of the other side.Other than Turkey, the only country outside the EU to form a customs union with it is Monaco: whose population would fill less than half of Wembley ­Stadium.Not even countries like Switzerland, with its close relationship with the EU, and Norway, which is a member of the EU’s single market, are in a customs union with the EU.This is because they know what a bad deal it would be for them.It would be a bad deal for Britain, too. And as ministers have always said, “no deal is better than a bad deal.” They need, therefore, to face down the rebels in Parliament, and tell Brussels we do not seek a customs union.To do that, the Government first needs to decide its own preferred customs policy. So far, ministers have floated two proposals. Both would run alongside a free trade agreement, which would guarantee zero tariffs and mutual recognition of standards for trade between Britain and Europe.The first proposal is a “highly streamlined customs arrangement”, which would involve some customs checks between Britain and the EU, but use technology and policy solutions to make trade as smooth as possible.The second is a “new customs partnership”, which would see Britain effectively act as the EU’s external border, running dual customs checks for goods bound for Britain and the EU.This second proposal was a creative way to reimagine the way customs checks operate. But after months of scrutiny, it seems unlikely to work. The EU has dismissed it as impossible, and it involves significant risks for Britain.It would almost certainly require “full regulatory alignment” with the EU, meaning that after Brexit we could not change our laws and regulations in a long list of ways. It would create a bureaucratic burden on businesses and some may choose to use higher EU tariffs, or avoid importing and exporting altogether.And, because of the need for alignment with EU regulations and the complexity of dual customs checks, it would be much harder to negotiate trade deals with other countries.So today, when Theresa May chairs her Brexit Cabinet Committee meeting, she should lead ministers to a clear decision about the Government’s favoured customs policy.That decision should be to reject the “new customs partnership” and pursue instead the Government’s own alternative proposal: its “highly streamlined customs arrangement”.As politicians and customs experts from around Europe have said, this approach is not only workable but desirable.As Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, says, it would help avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. And it would minimise bureaucracy and limit new barriers to trade with Europe. But it would also guarantee Britain could pursue an independent trade policy and strike trade agreements with the world’s fastest- growing economies.If we are still in a customs union, however, and unable to adopt an independent trade policy, many will conclude that we have not truly left the EU. And that will have enormous political consequences.So rebel Conservative MPs need to be careful what they wish for. A partial Brexit would almost certainly see the next election fought on a need to “finish the job”. It would see the future of the Conservative Party dominated by Britain’s relationship with the EU.  And it would surely mean Theresa May’s successor will be an advocate of a clean break.That is surely not what Remainers want. For Britain to make the most of Brexit, for our new relationship with Europe to be sustainable, and for the Tories to focus on vital economic and social reforms, Brexit really must mean Brexit — ministers and MPs must reject the customs union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The disdain they had for me, and the ownership of me because I’m black and a woman and a Muslim.She is one of many young people who are defying the Corbynista trend - saying the leftie Labour boss has made them LESS likely to support the party, even as he attracts thousands of youth voters with his radical message.Even diehard Labour supporters say theyve been pushed away, disgusted by the partys extreme foreign policy, runaway spending plans and anti-Semitism crisis.Sam Stopp, 27, has been a Labour councillor for four years - but is now thoroughly disillusioned by Mr Corbyns leadership.He told The Sun: It’s got to a point now that’s completely toxic, and there’s no way back for the forces of sanity in the party.The thing that really sped up the decision was anti-Semitism - it’s so detestable what’s going on at every level of the party.When you’re going to bed every night worrying about the party you’re in, it’s not a great situation.Not only is he not standing for re-election in Brent, West London at tomorrows council election - he has resigned from the party altogether.While some ex-Labour types initially gave Mr Corbyn the benefit of the doubt - Nimco said she kind of liked him when he took over - others were turned off from the moment he became leader.Edinburgh-based student Robbie Travers, 21, said: I resigned on the day Corbyn became leader.I’ve always been a supporter of the Blairite wing of the Labour party - that wing no longer exists.He told The Sun he was disturbed by Mr Corbyns foreign policy stance, including supporting the Kremlins line on the Salisbury poisoning and Syria chemical attack.Robbie also said he was outraged by the growth of anti-Semitism - admitting that the downside of no longer being a Labour member is that he cant fight for the rights of Jewish activists from the inside.Ms Ali, who moved to Cardiff as a child after fleeing Somalia with her family, said she fears Labour has a passive-aggressive attitude towards entrepreneurial ethnic minorities.She told The Sun: It’s the passive-aggressive racism of ‘stay poor, stay black’ - someone like me really baffles them. Being on the centre ground really freaks them out.How are you going to deliver better services when you’re driving out people who create wealth? They still think that the biggest issue is about keeping the jobs down the mines!None of those who spoke to us can bring themselves to vote Labour next time around - saying theyll back whichever party can keep Mr Corbyn out of power.Nimco - who joined Labour when Gordon Brown was leader - said: I’m happy to back the Tory party to keep Corbyn and his Shadow Cabinet out of power.The Labour party doesn’t represent the people that it says it speaks for. I want them to change - but there’s no hope for them.Robbie added: I would actively vote Conservative at elections to undermine Corbyn’s Labour party.I think Jeremy Corbyn is very much a red line in terms of ever supporting the Labour party again.And Sam - despite being a Labour official until recently - concluded: I would have to vote against Labour because it comes down to a choice between party and country. I really think the Labour party is an enemy of the state at the moment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403025806.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"statue man giant penis antwerp middelheim museum","story":"Locals are said to have given officials a hard time after the artwork was erected in the park of the Middelheim Museum in the Belgian city of Antwerp.The statue, called Arc de Triomphe, depicts a naked man bent backwards in a sort of crab position with his manhood brazenly pointing skyward.It is hoped the statue, which is made from plasticine, will be turned into a fountain, but it’s not clear just where the water will come out of.Museum director Sara Weyns said: I determine that nude bodies can indeed touch visitors.We do have quite a lot of nude bodies in our collection, but those are often womens bodies.Apparently those evoke less outrage than this piece.Of course this is a work made from plasticine and not from bronze, which makes it a lot more real-looking. I assume that is why the reactions are quite stronger.Many locals are thought to have complained and made some pretty stiff objections to the eye-catching sculpture, made by the Austrian art collective Getlitin.The piece is part of an exhibition called Antwerp Baroque 2018: Rubens Inspires which opens at the start of June.The exhibition refers to one of Antwerps most famous sons, the baroque master painter Peter Paul Rubens who is known for his nudes of voluptuous women.The museum invited 16 artists to submit art which was inspired by baroque landscaping elements."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000397100141.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ministers to roll out universal code on censorship to stop universities from stifling free speech","story":"In the biggest Government intervention on the issue for more than 30 years the Universities Minister Sam Gyimah will tell campuses to protect free speech and stamp out institutional hostility to views that are unfashionable or unpopular.It comes after increasing alarm at policies such as safe spaces, no platforming and other measures used to block controversial guest speakers and gagging unpopular views to avoid causing offence to snowflake students.A survey of 115 universities found 55 per cent “actively censor speech,” while 39 per cent “stifle speech through excessive regulation”.There have been reports of speakers, debates, literature and organisations being opposed or criticised, often by student unions, societies or specific groups of students.Mr Sam Gyimah will hold a summit with uni bosses today - and will warn that higher education institutions must take fresh action to protect free speech.He said he is calling on universities and colleges to stamp out the institutional hostility to unfashionable views that have emerged in some student societies.The minister will urge institutions to work with the Government following recent reports of a rise in so-called safe spaces and no-platform policies that have appeared on campuses.It is understood that Thursdays summit, which will be attended by university and student leaders among others, is the first step to drawing up new universal rules on free speech that will eventually be used by all institutions.This is the first time the Government has taken action on the issue since the free speech duty was introduced as part of an Education Act in 1986, the the Department for Education (DfE) said.Mr Gyimah said: A society in which people feel they have a legitimate right to stop someone expressing their views on campus simply because they are unfashionable or unpopular is rather chilling.There is a risk that overzealous interpretation of a dizzying variety of rules is acting as a brake on legal free speech on campus.That is why I am bringing together leaders from across the higher education sector to clarify the rules and regulations around speakers and events to prevent bureaucrats or wreckers on campus from exploiting gaps for their own ends.Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of vice-chancellors group Universities UK, said: Universities are committed to promoting and protecting free speech within the law.Tens of thousands of speaking events are put on every year across the country, the majority pass without incident.A small number of flashpoints do occasionally occur, on contentious or controversial issues, but universities do all they can to protect free speech so events continue.A report published by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in March argued that free speech on campus is being hampered by factors such as intolerant attitudes and unacceptable behaviour, red tape and a lack of clear guidance.Sir Michael Barber, chairman of the new Office for Students, which will have powers to sanction institutions that do not uphold free speech, has previously said that university codes on the subject can be too complicated.He suggested that while institutions do need to think about issues surrounding free speech on campus, there is a danger that rules can be too complex.No-platforming is a practice in which a group or individuals seen to have unacceptable or offensive views are banned from taking part in a public debate or meeting, or when others refuse to share a platform with them, while safe space policies aim to ensure all students feel able to express themselves and are protected from views and language they find offensive, as well as discrimination.GOT a story?

Harry, 33, joked he “got down on one knee” to ask Wills to return the favour he had performed for him at his wedding to Kate in 2011.Here are the other key players — minus of course, the family member Harry would most liked to have attended, his beloved mother Diana.He was with Harry on the infamous lads’ trip to Las Vegas in 2012 when Harry played pool while naked. Skippy was also there when the royal jumped into a ­nightclub swimming pool in Croatia fully clothed in 2011.CHARLIE VAN STRAUBENZEE, 29: Has known Harry since their days at Ludgrove Prep School in Berkshire. Old Harrovian Charlie works in finance and is due to marry film-maker Daisy Jenks, 27, later this year.TOM VAN STRAUBENZEE, 35: Charlie’s elder brother, hard-partying “Vans” is a friend of both Wills and Harry and was married to Lady Melissa Percy, daughter of the Duke of Northumberland, before their bitter divorce two years ago.ADAM BIDWELL, 42: Stockbroker “Bidders”, as Harry calls him, dated singer Katherine Jenkins in 2013. He was on the infamous Vegas trip with Harry and Skippy.ARTHUR LANDON, 37: Another Vegas survivor, he inherited £500million when his land-owning dad Tim died in 2007, allowing him to accompany Harry on his jaunts.Before the Vegas trip he posted a snap of his suitcase showing he had packed a gas mask and several fancy dress outfits.WILLIAM VAN CUTSEM, 38: Prince George’s godfather and a life-long friend of Wills and Harry. Prince Charles’s closest friend was William’s dad Hugh van Cutsem and all the princes attended his funeral in 2013.MARK DYER, 52: Prince Charles’s equerry acted as a surrogate second older brother to Harry after Diana died. The former Army officer is married to Texan heiress Amanda Kline and Harry is very close to both. Meghan was pictured with the couple last June, watching Harry play polo.JESSICA MULRONEY, 37: Meghan’s BFF from Toronto and daughter-in-law of former Canadian PM Brian Mulroney. Has helped Meghan plan wedding and pick dress designer.LINDSAY ROTH, 36: Meghan’s best pal from university in the US, now lives in London with lawyer husband Gavin Jordan.She and Meghan have often holidayed together and Lindsay once said: “We’re the kind of friends who can be 3,000 miles away and still be talking about or thinking the same thing.”PRINCESS CHARLOTTE, 3: Wills and Kate’s cutie-pie daughter is guaranteed to steal the show. Has already practised flower girl duties at Auntie Pippa’s wedding last May.BENITA LITT’s twin daughters, 5: As one of their mother’s closest friends, Meghan has acted as the girls’ “fairy godmother” and last year helped the family decorate their Christmas tree.Benita launched bag company Legend of Lido in the States and also runs her own brand agency which helps others to start their own businesses.Harry and Meghan visited the royal mews at Buckingham Palace to select the Ascot Landau, built in 1883, for the procession after their ceremony.He was in one of two used for Wills and Kate in 2011.If it rains, the 1830 Scottish State Coach is on standby.IVY MULRONEY, 4: The daughter of bridesmaid Jessica and her husband Ben is a regular on her mum’s Instagram page with its 109,000 followers.Christened Isabel but known as Ivy, she has already appeared in a fashion photoshoot for ­Canadian jewellery brand Birks, whose rings and necklaces Meghan has often worn.PRINCE GEORGE, 4: He threw a toddler tantrum at Auntie Pippa’s wedding last year, so mum Kate will be hoping he is on his best behaviour with his great Gan Gan, the Queen, in the congregation on May 19.It will only have been four weeks since the birth of his little brother Louis, so nanny Maria Borrallo will be on hand to keep the youngsters in order.JASPER DYER, 5: In April 2017, Harry revealed he has “five or six” godchildren, one of whom is thought to be Jasper, son of usher Mark Dyer.DORIA RAGLAND, 61: As Harry’s future mum-in-law, social worker Doria clearly gave her seal of approval to the match — she was the first of Meghan’s family to meet Harry and she flew 2,500 miles from her LA home to Toronto for the closing of the Prince’s Invictus Games last September.Doria is also a yoga instructor, so should be able to show the couple some relaxation exercises in case of wedding day jitters.THOMAS MARKLE SENIOR, 72: The former TV lighting director worked on iconic shows such as Married With Children. One thing Harry can be sure of — his future father-in-law knows all about ­marriage, having been wed twice himself.Meghan was just six when her parents divorced in 1987. There have been some concerns as to whether Thomas, now living in retirement in New Mexico, will make the wedding and meet Harry for the first time.

similar to devices used by tow trucks, according to the fire service.Cops said there was no threat to public safety and there was already caution tape around the area below the car before officers arrived.Constable Jenifferjit Sidhu told The Globe and Mail: There’s also the chance that whatever it was being held with could’ve broken or ripped apart and someone could have been hurt.“The main thing with this is the amount of resources it occupied, which could have been used to answer other emergency calls.”Social media users speculated whether engineering students were behind the alleged prank.But a representative of the engineering faculty at the University of Toronto, told the newspaper they were not involved, saying it was “far more serious” than any of their typical handiwork.It follows a similar prank in 2001 when University of British Columbia scholars suspended a classic Volkswagen Beetle from San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge.In 2009, students at the same university tried to pull off the stunt in Vancouver but the the cables broke and the vehicle was sent plunging into the water.Five undergraduates were caught and threatened with criminal charges.In 1994, Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Engineering students placed a police car on the roof of a campus building and it had to be disassembled to be removed."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000329463722.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"local elections 2018 results winners announced polls close","story":"If you are planning to stay up all night and watch the results as they come in, weve got everything you need to know right here..Local election polls opened this morning at 7am to allow some keen voters to get their vote done and dusted before heading off to work.For those of you who havent had a chance to vote yet, polling stations are open until 10pm this evening.If youre heading to cast a ballot at Woking, Gosport, Bromley, Watford or Swindon dont forget to take your voter ID as these council are taking part in a trial to stop voter fraud.The majority of councils will start counting over night so once the polls shut the first election results should be coming out within a matter of hours.However, some councils may wait to start counting on Friday daytime, leaving voters in suspense all night and most of the day.This years local elections are set to be a watched carefully for an indication on how Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyns parties are faring in the public opinion.Last year, Labour saw many red councils lost to their Conservative rivals - something they will be looking to gain back today.In London one of the key councils to watch is Barnet, North London - a former Tory stronghold which currently has 1 seat difference between the two major parties.Its been identified as a potential Labour swing seat, but with a large Jewish population it may see the antisemitism row within Labour cost Jeremy a relatively easy target.Other key targets in for Labour are Wandsworth, Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Trafford and Swindon according to latest predictions.For the Conservatives, key councils include booting the Lib Dems out of Sutton, their council left in the country, Thurrock in Essex, Basildon, Colchester, Pendle and Portsmouth.1amThe fastest council to declare at 1am is expected to be Sunderland, a Labour stronghold, which has announced its results first for six years.Its thought Conservative safe seat Broxbourne wont be far behind and declare at around 1am.The first Labour-Tory battleground to declare it expected to be Swindon where Labour need just four seats to knock the Conservative majority and take control of the council.Experts predict Nuneaton \u0026amp Bedworth, Sefton, Cannock Chase, Bury, Basildon, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, Castle Point, Halton, Harlow, South Tyneside, Tameside, West Oxfordshire, and Exeter will also declare around 1am.1.30amPrestwich in Bury is expected to declare at around 1.30am and will be the first wards to show if there has been a swing away from Labour by its large Jewish population after the antisemitism scandal that has rocked Labour. 2amWestminster is expected to declare between 2 and 2.30am as Conservative despite the seat being ferociously targeted by Labour -if they managed to catch the council itll be the first time a red majority will have held Westminster since its formation.Also forecast to announce are Trafford, Peterborough, Amber Valley, Oxford, St Albans, Chorley, Epping Forest, Fareham, Hard, Hartlepool, Kingston-upon-Hull, North Herfordshire, Oldham, Preston, Rochdale, Rochford, Salford, Tamworth, Wirral, Wolverhampton, Worcester, Carlisle, Lincoln, Stevenage, Stockport, West Lancashire, and Wigan.3amWe can expect to see the first of the capitals mayoral result from Tower Hamlets - it isnt expected to be a guaranteed Labour win as a candidate for the Peoples Alliance of Tower Hamlets has mounted a fierce opposition against current Labour mayor John Biggs.Whoever wins the race for Tower Hamlets mayor will select their cabinet from the councillors elected in tonights vote which isnt expected to be declared for another five hours.Labour target Wandsworth is also expected to declare at 3am with their supporters anxiously looking on to see if they have taken it from the Conservatives.The other councils expected to declare are Sheffield, Dudley, Plymouth, Southend-on-Sea, Liverpool, Barking \u0026amp Dagenham, Hammersmith \u0026amp Fulham, North East Lincolnshire, Basingstoke \u0026amp Dean, Brentwood, Colchester, Eastleigh, Gosport, Havant, Rushmoor, Sandwell, St Helens, Tandridge, Waltham Forest, Cheltenham, Coventry, and Rugby.4amWe will see results from marginal council Barnet, hotly contested between both Labour and Conservatives as the last election saw the council stay blue by two seats.Its been targeted strongly by Labour but it is home to the largest Jewish population in the country who may help it remain a Conservative stronghold and out of Corbyns grasp.Lib Dem targeted Richmond-upon-Thames will also be declaring. It was a strong Conservative hold last time, but with the large number of EU remain voters living there it may become the Lib Dems second council in the country - assuming they hold onto Sutton which will be declaring almost an hour later.Also forecast to declare are Hillingdon, Reading, Walsall, Bradford, Portsmouth, Bolton, Ipswich, Slough, Wakefield, Wokingham, Daventry, Welwyn Hatfield.5amKensington and Chelsea, the most unpredictable result in the election, is expected to be declared at 5am  - in the wake of Labours recent general election there it is thought the council may turn red.However, staunch Tory supporters in the south of the borough may help them keep the council blue despite anger over the handling of the Grenfell disaster.UKIPs electoral clout will be put to the test in Thurrock which saw the party gain 17 councillors last time round - only for them all to quit en masse to form a new group denouncing party politics.Its expected to remain under Conservative control, but has had no majority party since Labour in 2012.Sutton will also be announcing their results and eyes will be watching to see if the Lib Dems retain their only council.Also expected to declare are Bexley, Southampton, Leeds, Winchester, Brent, and Cambridge.6amElection results start to quieten down with only Ealing and Derby expected to declare.Political reps will be gearing up for the final hours of TV battles and debates on breakfast television.7amCroydon, Redbridge, Camden, Southwark, and Tower Hamlets council are expected to declare.8amPolitical machines get whirring as voters sit down for breakfast to see Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis and Labour elections chief Andrew Gwynne battle it out on the silver screen.Its thought Merton and Greenwhich will declare around 8am.Theres expected to be around 50 of the 150 councils left to declare.12pmA big break is expected between 8am and 12pm before the next lot of declarations come in.First up in the afternoon is expected to be the Lewisham and Watford mayor results and Bromley council.1pmMore counts will be in from Calderdale, Solihull, Great Yarmouth, Burnley, Gateshead, Kirklees, and Milton Keynes.Also expected to be declared is the Newham mayor.2pmThe first of the metro mayors is expected to be declared in Sheffield.The councils declaring are thought to be Maidstone, Crawley, Hyndburn, Norwhich, Knowsley, North Tyneside, Rossendale, Runnymead, Hounslow, and Wyre Forest.3pmExpected to declare are Three Rivers, Hastings, Hackney mayor, Tunbridge Wells, Pendle, Adur, Barnsley, Craven, Harrogate, Huntingdonshrie, Mole Valley, Worthing, and Cherwell.4pmStragglers are still coming through with their counts late into the afternoon - in fact theres another estimate two hours before all the councils declare.Expected to announce results are Newcastle-under-Lyme, Harrow, Harringey, Watford, Blackburn with Darwen, Elmbridge, Reigate \u0026amp Barnstead.5pmDeclaring with an hour to go until all results are expected to be in are Kingston-upon-Thames, Newham, Lewisham, South Cambridge, and Woking.6pmAnd the FINAL results are in with South Lakeland, Birmingham, Manchester, Islington, Lambeth, and Hackeny being the last councils expected to declare.With that its all over, the political battle to gain new territory and snatch back old councils will have come to an end.We might even have an idea of what to expect when the next general election comes round in 2022. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The family tried to ignore them because we didn’t need to prove anything.Then I said, ‘let’s do the test then, to prove it and put a stop to them (rumours).”But when he received the results he was stunned to discover he wasn’t related to the couple who had raised him.The shocked family then started a desperate search for the truth - and their long-lost son.They asked the hospital Monsenhor Genesio for the names of all the babies born between October 1 and 7 1980.Only two on the list were boys, and when they found a photo of one of them - Noel -  they were sure he was the one who was their biological son.However, when they spoke to a neighbour where Noel used to live they were told the tragic news he had died aged just one.The couple gave up the search, but Noel’s sister, Nelma Rezende, started her own hunt for her real brother on learning of the Gaspars story from the neighbour .Nelma’s husband Caio eventually tracked Romualdo down after finding his godparents through the local registry office.He said when he finally saw a photo of Romualdo he felt sick as the similarity to his wife was incredible.At that moment I had no doubt that he was my wife’s brother,” he added.After Nelma made contact with her biological brother, a DNA test confirmed he was the son of Nelma’s parents, Osvaldo and Valdevina de Lima.This week Romualdo finally met his biological parents, who live just a few miles away in the same town.He also discovered he has eight more brothers and sisters and 18 nieces and nephews.His real mum Valdevina, who lost the boy she believed was her real son in 1981, told Brazil’s G1 website: “After 38 years, at first I thought this was all a joke.“But over time the penny dropped, that it was all true.”Romulado added : “For me, this has no price. No money could buy the happiness that I feel at the moment.”The couple who brought him up believing he was their son are still holding on to the hope their real son is still alive - and are determined to find him.Radigena Gaspar said: “I am not convinced that it was really my son who died.My heart tells me that my son is still alive. I want so much to encounter him.”The Monsenhor Genesio in Juruaia at the centre of the mix-up said they have no comment to make on the case.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now all you need now is pound stretchers and Marks and Spencers to merge and it will be called stretch marks”.Another commented: “Every little helps”.While another said: “Good on the old boy for helping out.”A Tesco spokesperson said: Every day we see examples of our colleagues going above and beyond, helping customers and supporting local communities.Its why we say: Every little helps.A Waitrose spokesperson added: Were grateful to the driver ... Every Little Helps.It comes as the deal between Sainsbury’s and Asda triggered fears it will lead to pricier groceries, store closures and job losses.The proposed deal would see them leapfrog Tesco to become the UKs biggest chain.Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey warned it risks squeezing what little competition there is in the groceries market even further.She said in the absence of proper vetting by regulators, it would be British shoppers that suffer from rising prices and British workers that may be fearing for their jobs.The two chains are the second and third largest grocery retailers in the UK. Together they would have 31.4 per cent of the market compared to Tescos 27.6 per cent share.It comes as the boss of Sainsburys was caught singing Were in the Money on TV on Monday.Mike Coupes outburst came as he waited to be interviewed about the megadeal  and his supermarkets shares ended the day up 17 per cent.The chief exec did not realise his rendition of The Gold Diggers Song was being recorded by ITV.He sang: Were in the money, The skies are sunny, Lets lend it, spend it, send it rollin around! It is likely to anger critics who claim the merger will see job losses, store closures and higher prices.Mr Coupe said he was trying to compose himself ahead of his interview about the merger.He later apologised for his unfortunate choice of song, which he says was on his mind after he saw it performed in the musical 42nd Street last year.Sainsburys said their boss was simply trying to clear his mind, adding: To attach any wider meaning to this innocent, personal moment is preposterous."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403259972.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dogs polling stations cast vote local elections 2018","story":"London Mayor Sadiq Khan led the march of voters taking snaps of their dogs as they exercised their right to put a cross in the box this morning.He tweeted: Lunas first trip to a polling station! and a picture of himself and his gorgeous golden lab.Hes voting in Wandsworth, South London, where Labour are hoping to tip the balance of power and take over the borough for the first time in decades.And many other pet-owners have gone online to share their sweet snaps of their own dogs - after the trend popped up for 2015s General Election.Dogs are technically allowed in as long as they are just accompanying the voter and not running around causing havoc.But others have chosen to leave their beloved pets outside for a few minutes while they put their cross in the box.Olivias owner Dave said she would be voting for the LiBokral DemoNoCrats and the Greens (due to their pro-squirrel policies) in Lewisham.#DogsInPollingStations was trending on Twitter throughout the morning as snaps poured in from excited voters taking their pets with them to witness democracy in action.Britain is hitting the ballots today to cast their vote in the local elections which are being watched closely to see how Labour and the Conservative Party fare.Local election polls opened this morning at 7am to allow some keen voters to get their vote done and dusted before heading off to work.For those of you who havent had a chance to vote yet, polling stations are open until 10pm this evening.If youre heading to cast a ballot at Woking, Gosport, Bromley, Watford or Swindon dont forget to take your voter ID as these council are taking part in a trial to stop voter fraud.The majority of councils will start counting over night so once the polls shut the first election results should be coming out within a matter of hours.However, some councils may wait to start counting on Friday daytime, leaving voters in suspense all night and most of the day.Labour are expected to do well in city regions, but the Tories are set to rake in the votes in pro-Brexit Tory suburbs.Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have already been out casting their votes today - alongside Lib Dem boss Vince Cable and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.
