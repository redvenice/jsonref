But it will allow Murray to live pain-free and it could open the door to him becoming a tennis coach after he retires.    Murray had previously said ahead of the Australian Open earlier this month that he intended to retire after this year\u0027s WimbledonMurray was set for a farewell six months after emotionally announcing he was in too much pain to carry on in the build up to the first grand slam of the year.After losing to Roberto Bautista-Agut in the first round of the Australian Open, he said: ‘Tonight was not comfortable in terms of my hip. At the end, I’m really struggling, I can’t walk properly at all just now.\u0027I could play another match, but if I want to try to play again, I want to improve my quality of life, because even if I take four months I still can’t walk. I’m still in pain doing just basic day-to-day things.’ But the monumental five-set tussle showed the Scot still has the ability and desire to compete at the top level, and he said he would do everything he could to keep playing. Having the surgery, which happened in London on Monday, means he might not be fit to take part in Wimbledon this summer, where he had planned to say goodbye to the sport.And if it does not allow him to return to the court, he will have played the last game of his glittering career.In the lead up to his operation, he was in constant dialogue with American doubles specialist Bob Bryan, who has just returned to the game following the same procedure last summer.Mr Bryan has said: ‘Seeing the way Andy Murray is feeling hit a nerve with me. I would love to see him do a similar surgery, feel the relief that it gives. I think our hips are pretty similar – just worn down, no cartilage.‘I’m really the only guy to be playing on with a metal hip. So he’s been watching me like a hawk, asking me how I’m feeling after matches, after practices, where I’m at.’    Murray admitted being in pain during the Australian Open this month (pictured there)   A graphic shows how Murray\u0027s hip resurfacing procedure was carried out in hospital Murray had his first hip operation in Australia in January last year. It was carried out by Dr John O’Donnell, who is regarded as one of the leading experts in hip arthroscopy.  Under a resurfacing procedure, damaged bone and cartilage inside a patient’s hip joint are removed and replaced with a metal ‘dome’ surface.Typically patients spend two or three days in hospital and should be walking again soon afterwards.The ATP Tour tweeted support for Murray, posting: ‘Yesterday Andy Murray underwent hip resurfacing surgery in London. Get well soon Andy, we know you will do everything to get back on tour!?’British Tennis also sent out a tweet in support, saying: ‘Good luck in your recovery from hip resurfacing surgery Andy!’"},{"url":null,"title":"Cat shades reclines owners backpack Rio bank foyer","story":"    The chilled feline lies back on its owners bag inside a bank foyer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil           The chilled cat continues lying on its back as bemused customers walk past in the foyerDuring the clip, the cat, that bears a startling similarity to the TV show character Garfield, keeps onlookers amused as he relaxes at the front of the bank in a tranquil state. The chilled cat lies on his back as he takes a quick snooze during his busy day out in Rio.Beloved cat who went missing for two months is reunited with...Share this articleThe amusing video, which was published on YouTube on January 25, has already received more than 20,000 views.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn finally clambered off the fence and announced he would back the amendments against no deal - but his effort failed as the main Cooper amendment was defeated Amendments from Mr Corbyn and SNP leader Ian Blackford were both dispatched with ease - 327 MPs filed into the Government lobby both times, enough to win any vote.The third vote was crucial as a plan from Tory MP Dominic Grieve - to hand MPs the power to debate and vote on Brexit every Tuesday until there is a deal - was tested.Fifteen Conservative MPs rebelled - the usual Remain rebels including Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry - but they were cancelled out by 14 Labour MPs. The Labour group included Brexit supporters like Kate Hoey and Dennis Skinner, and those from Leave-voting areas like Caroline Flint.It meant the Government won again - 321 to 301 - and by a bigger margin than many had expected.It set the stage for the Cooper amendment to fail in the fourth vote of the night. This time 17 Tories rebelled but again they were cancelled out by the same bloc of 14 Labour MPs.Ms Cooper\u0027s plan lost by a slightly larger margin of 321 to 298 - a majority of 23 and a clear signal the Commons would back Mrs May to renegotiate the deal.A fifth vote on an amendment from Rachel Reeves - to make a political statement saying the same as Ms Cooper\u0027s proposed law - was seen off 322-290.The sixth vote on Dame Caroline Spelman\u0027s amendment tarnished the night for Mrs May.The amendment set out a statement that a no deal Brexit would be unacceptable - but made no effort to change the law or force the Government to do anything.The same 17 Conservative MPs rebelled to support the motion but this time only three Labour MPs went the other way.It meant the rebels won 318 to 310 - a symbolic blow to Mrs May that could encourage the EU not to give ground in any new negotiations.But it did not stop Mrs May securing the most important victory of the night when the Brady amendment was finally called to a vote at 8.26pm.    The results meant Theresa May could return to the Despatch Box at 8.41pm to hail a way forward on Brexit The motion carried 317 to 301, with just eight Tory rebels voting against sending Mrs May back for a final push on the border backstop.Seven Labour MPs voted the other way, joining forces with all 10 DUP MPs and three Independents to get Mrs May over the line.She told the Commons: \u0027A fortnight ago, this House clearly rejected the proposed Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration with just 202 members voting in favour.\u0027Tonight a majority of Honourable Members have said they would support a deal with changes to the backstop.\u0027Combined with measures to address concerns over Parliament’s role in the negotiation of the future relationship and commitments on workers’ rights, in law where need be, it is now clear that there is a route that can secure a substantial and sustainable majority in this House for leaving the EU with a deal.\u0027We will now take this mandate forward and seek to obtain legally binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement that deal with concerns on the backstop while guaranteeing no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\u0027    SIR GRAHAM BRADY\u0027S PLAN TO FIX THE BACKSTOP BY DEMANDING CHANGES FROM THE EU - BACKED BY MAYWHAT IT DOES: Proposes replacing the Northern Ireland backstop with \u0027alternative arrangements\u0027 to avoid a hard border.

Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper, former Tory ministers Nick Boles and Sir Oliver Letwin.HOW IT WORKS: Ministers lose the power to decide what is debated on February 5, which passes to backbench MPs. Miss Cooper proposes a law forcing Mrs May to ask for a delay on Brexit if No Deal is agreed by February 26.WHAT HAPPENED: Defeated 321 to 298, majority 23.  DOMINIC GRIEVE\u0027S PLAN TO HAND POWER TO MPSWHAT IT DOES: Give control over Parliamentary business to MPs.WHOSE PLAN? Dominic Grieve QC, former attorney general and ardent Remainer, and MPs who want a second referendum.HOW IT WORKS: Government loses power over the Commons every Tuesday from February 12 to March 26 so backbench MPs could vote on Brexit.

Emmerson Dutton, a partner at Bedfords office in Bury St Edmunds office, said: \u0027I am sure that the gravestones have been a factor in putting off some buyers.\u0027It is a very stylish property, but the activity levels around it have certainly been lower than we would expect.          The main living space which has oak flooring includes a kitchen with state of the art cabinets, an island, granite work tops and a range-style oven   The first floor has a galleried landing around three sides of the building which Bedfords say could be used as a playroom, study areas or hobby space\u0027I think the people who are concerned about the graves don\u0027t go as far as asking for a viewing. We are not trying to hide the gravestones away so the details clearly show them.\u0027But although the house still has the original two doors at the front, the main entrance is at the back via driveway on the side.\u0027It means that people don\u0027t have to walk down the path between the graves into the house.\u0027Also when you are inside the house, you are not really overlooking the graves because of the layout inside.\u0027 The house was originally up for sale at £595,000 with a different agent before it was taken on by Bedfords who cut the price to £550,000, before cutting it again.          The home has been converted into a modern and spacious property with a 25ft by 35ft open plan double height living room and kitchenMr Dutton believes the house is worth at least £100,000 more than its price tag due. He said: \u0027It just seems buyers are put off which is such a shame as the cost of the conversion far outweighs the price it\u0027s for sale for.\u0027Someone is going to get a real bargain.

The Spelman amendment, after all, is not legally binding.There has been a great deal of talk in recent weeks that Parliament itself would take control of the Brexit process from Theresa May and Downing Street.Last night the exact opposite happened. Theresa May took back control of Brexit from Parliament. As a result, she looks more secure in her job than she has done for a very long time.Nor was that vital strategic win the only matter for Downing Street celebration. As Tory MPs united behind Mrs May’s deal, Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party split wide open as a dozen Labour rebels defied a three-line Labour whip over the Cooper amendment and thereby saved Mrs May’s skin – just. New mother is slapped with a $170 parking fine while she was...PG\u0026E files for bankruptcy citing mounting lawsuits from...Share this articleBut I would warn against too much exultation in Downing Street. The Prime Minister has paid a price for her victory in terms of personal reputation and credibility.Let’s not forget her new strategy involves going back to the deal she defended for so long – one she agreed with the 27 other nations of the EU less than two months ago.Before Christmas, Theresa May signed up for the so-called ‘Irish backstop’. This gave a guarantee that there would never be border controls between Ireland and Northern Ireland.But the plan was hated by Brexiteering Conservative MPs because they feared the European Union would use the backstop as a device to keep Britain in the European customs union for ever.After days of frantic backstairs plotting, Mrs May has won their support by promising to ditch the backstop. She will now ask to open negotiations with Europe for so-called ‘alternative arrangements’.    Theresa May headed off the concerted attempt by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Tory MP Nick Boles to seize back control for Parliament todayBy doing so, she’s kept Britain on course to leave the European Union on March 29, just 58 days from now. However – and I say this with a heavy heart as a supporter of the PM – last night’s victory has come at the cost of a pretty dramatic U-turn from the PM.She has only secured her survival by scrapping a deal which she personally agreed to barely eight weeks ago. Back then, remember, she insisted that the backstop was unchangeable.Now she appears to believe that it can be rewritten after all. What is more, Mrs May seems to think that she can do this in the next two weeks, having promised to come back to the Commons by February 13 for a second ‘meaningful vote’.To many this looks like dreamland, for many in Brussels will take a dim view of Britain’s decision to renege on a deal that was struck last year – and go back demanding changes.It needs to be said that Mrs May is not the only one who has shifted their position. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is equally guilty.He hypocritically opposed Mrs May’s proposal last night, even though he was actually against the backstop in the first place!Last night, Mrs May criticised Mr Corbyn for facing both ways over Brexit. So what next? What follows in the coming days is essentially an almighty act of brinkmanship.          Earlier in the evening, President Macron warned that there would be no renegotiation on the backstopThe Prime Minister must now set herself directly at odds with the European Union.Essentially, she is making the brutal calculation that the EU leaders will dump the backstop by renegotiating the agreement.Last night, all the indications were that they would refuse to do so. Earlier in the evening, President Macron warned that there would be no renegotiation on the backstop. His words were endorsed shortly after the vote by the EU president Donald Tusk, who announced that ‘the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for re-negotiation’.This means we have entered terrifyingly unpredictable territory. The possibility of a No Deal Brexit has suddenly become far more likely, with all the potentially catastrophic consequences of economic meltdown it involves. No wonder sterling was falling in value last night.Mrs May has opened herself to the charge of putting the Tory party before the country. Perhaps she will not mind that too much.Don’t underestimate the depth of the fears that the party could split in two between hardline Brexiteers and the rest as a consequence of Brexit. That outcome has now been postponed, though not put off altogether.So Mrs May’s triumph is far from complete. With less than ten weeks to go till Brexit Day, there is still a great deal to be achieved. What if the EU keeps to its word and refuses to budge?There may yet be a mighty arm-wrestle to come.

But it will allow Murray to live pain-free and it could open the door to him becoming a tennis coach after he retires.          Murray had previously said ahead of the Australian Open earlier this month that he intended to retire after this year\u0027s WimbledonMurray was set for a farewell six months after emotionally announcing he was in too much pain to carry on in the build up to the first grand slam of the year.After losing to Roberto Bautista-Agut in the first round of the Australian Open, he said: ‘Tonight was not comfortable in terms of my hip. At the end, I’m really struggling, I can’t walk properly at all just now.\u0027I could play another match, but if I want to try to play again, I want to improve my quality of life, because even if I take four months I still can’t walk. I’m still in pain doing just basic day-to-day things.’ But the monumental five-set tussle showed the Scot still has the ability and desire to compete at the top level, and he said he would do everything he could to keep playing. Having the surgery, which happened in London on Monday, means he might not be fit to take part in Wimbledon this summer, where he had planned to say goodbye to the sport.And if it does not allow him to return to the court, he will have played the last game of his glittering career.In the lead up to his operation, he was in constant dialogue with American doubles specialist Bob Bryan, who has just returned to the game following the same procedure last summer.Mr Bryan has said: ‘Seeing the way Andy Murray is feeling hit a nerve with me. I would love to see him do a similar surgery, feel the relief that it gives. I think our hips are pretty similar – just worn down, no cartilage.‘I’m really the only guy to be playing on with a metal hip. So he’s been watching me like a hawk, asking me how I’m feeling after matches, after practices, where I’m at.’    Murray admitted being in pain during the Australian Open this month (pictured there)   A graphic shows how Murray\u0027s hip resurfacing procedure was carried out in hospital Murray had his first hip operation in Australia in January last year. It was carried out by Dr John O’Donnell, who is regarded as one of the leading experts in hip arthroscopy.  Under a resurfacing procedure, damaged bone and cartilage inside a patient’s hip joint are removed and replaced with a metal ‘dome’ surface.Typically patients spend two or three days in hospital and should be walking again soon afterwards.The ATP Tour tweeted support for Murray, posting: ‘Yesterday Andy Murray underwent hip resurfacing surgery in London. Get well soon Andy, we know you will do everything to get back on tour!?’British Tennis also sent out a tweet in support, saying: ‘Good luck in your recovery from hip resurfacing surgery Andy!’"},{"url":null,"title":"Delighted owners share snaps prized pooches glued TV","story":"    Pet owners shared snaps of their pooches glued to their TV screens as the winner of Britain\u0027s top 100 dog breed was announced.

But ultimately the problem is not the deal, or the backstop, or Brussels: it is Brexit itselfBritish politics now follows the tortured pattern of addiction. Inside the addict’s head the most important thing is getting to the next Brexit fix, scoring the best deal. But from the outside, to our European friends and family, it is obvious that the problem is the compulsive pursuit of a product that does us only harm. On Tuesday night Theresa May thought she had scored: a slender majority in parliament voted for an imaginary agreement in Brussels, stripped of the hated “backstop”. Tory Eurosceptic ultras and the DUP pledged conditional allegiance to the prime minister if she delivers “alternative arrangements” for a seamless border on Northern Ireland. But no one has any idea what those might be and the EU has already ruled out a renegotiation on terms that might satisfy the hardliners. The transient buzz of Tory unity will yield to the chilly comedown of Brexit reality, as it always does.Some MPs can see the situation spiralling out of control. Today 298 lined up to demand an intervention. They backed a cross-party bid to seize control of the Brexit agenda from the government and delay the day of departure if necessary. But the move failed. There is ample horror of the no-deal scenario across the Commons (a vaguer condemnation of that option won a narrow majority), but clearly the greater fear is association with anything that looks like an active plot to thwart Brexit. Yvette Cooper and Nick Boles, sponsors of the more controversial amendment, insisted their aim was only to guarantee an orderly departure, and there is no reason to doubt them. Parliament is packed with pro-Europeans who say no to the hard junk peddled by the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg but are still hooked on softer strains of the leave drug.There is a booming trade in legal Brexit highs for MPs. The newest variant to hit the Westminster street is a confection put together by Kit Malthouse, a leave-voting Tory. His product has been endorsed by a remarkable spread of Conservative MPs, from former remainers to hardline Brexiteers. They grandiosely call it the “Malthouse compromise” – as if it were a magisterial vision for peace among nations and not a ragged stitch-up to postpone Tory civil war.The idea has two parts: first, renegotiate the backstop that promises a frictionless Northern Irish border second, if renegotiation fails, scrap the deal but salvage the transition period contained within in it. Then aim for an exit on WTO terms.It is a strange kind of compromise plan that offers no compromise. The backstop only exists because May’s Brexit red lines could not be bent around the Good Friday agreement any other way. As for the transition period, it is a condition of the current deal. The idea that it can be cut and pasted into some other deal presumes that the past two years have just been a warm-up before the real match starts. This new Malthouse doctrine is really the old hardline Brexit delusions in shinier shoes. It is the bluff that Britain holds all the cards, and that if we show enough contempt for treaties and economic logic, Brussels will be intimidated into granting favours that could not be won by conventional diplomacy.There are two possible reasons for pursuing that strategy. One is stupidity: failure to grasp what the negotiations so far have actually been about and how May’s deal was their logical outcome. The second is cynical vandalism: knowing that the plan will fail and hoping, when it does, to pin blame for a chaotic no-deal Brexit on Brussels intransigence. In truth it would be the fruition of Eurosceptic zealotry.It is sad to see self-styled Tory “moderates” taken in by such a con and alarming to hear May indulge it in the Commons as a “serious proposal”. Her next move is to Brussels, in a quest for something that two years of negotiation have already failed to uncover. But it seems the way to unite Tories these days is to expunge the period 2017 to 2018 from memory. May still acts as if Brexit is something that must be settled to the satisfaction of the Conservative party first, and only then shared with the rest of Europe. The British public is at the very back of the queue.Such obtuseness infuriates continental leaders more than the intent to quit their club. It was not a secret that Britain had a Eurosceptic political culture, even if the referendum result was shocking and upsetting. But what was also obvious in Brussels, Berlin and Paris was the gap between the idea of Brexit advertised by the leave campaign – the narcotic rush of words such as “freedom” and “sovereignty” – and the practical business of extricating Britain from EU structures. Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and others presumed this yawning chasm would be recognised by their British counterpart as a hazard. They expected May to start building bridges from the leavers’ fantasy island to the reality of what was available in negotiations with a bloc of 27 countries – the imbalance of power and the calculus of damage limitation.But May never confronted that logic. When she took the referendum result as her personal mission she also anointed herself with sacred oils of Brexiteer mythology. Her inscrutable demeanour and robotic speeches conceal a fervour that would be instantly identifiable as demagogy in a more expressive politician. At first, the prime minister’s rigid mask tricked Europeans into thinking she was a reasonable and capable person. It had a similar effect on the domestic audience. May’s bland style flattered a collective belief in the innate moderation of our politics. Her parochial mediocrity has nurtured the complacent assumption that the worst cannot happen here, that we are, at heart, a pragmatic nation not given to fanatical lurches. MPs imagine parliament as a political equivalent to the Greenwich meridian – the zero line from which other countries’ deviations are measured. We are slow to notice when the whole enterprise drifts wildly off course.Yet no one watching from the outside retains that romantic view of Britain as a bastion of political sobriety. They see instead a weird, stubborn refusal to talk about the crisis in plain English. MPs do battle over amendments to motions that change standing orders to permit bills to insist on extensions to a negotiating period, without saying what they think the outcome of that negotiation should be. Meanwhile, the prime minister invites her backbenchers to vote against something she has agreed in Brussels so she can go back and ask for something that she knows will be rejected.It is obvious that Brexit is a disaster, yet still so many MPs observe a taboo against saying that it should be stopped. To our continental friends and neighbours it is scarcely comprehensible. It looks like British social awkwardness elevated to the scale of a constitutional meltdown. It is the stiff upper lip chewing itself to pieces rather than name the cause of our suffering: not the deal, not the backstop, not the timetable, not Brussels, but Brexit. The poison in our system is Brexit. We need a path to recovery, not May’s frantic hunt for a stronger, purer dose."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de388109d78393e713a8339014c870a04a5684ef/0_317_5453_3272/master/5453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30fff253d2d2852245857b84fafdf9d5","title":"brexit political class politicians","story":"History will damn the architects of Brexit – and the politicians on both sides whose delusions are leading us to disasterStressed out by Brexit? I have a mindfulness exercise for you, one guaranteed to bring calm. Instead of imagining a deep, cool lake or a beach of bone-white sand, comfort yourself by imagining the day, several years from now, when a Chilcot-style inquiry probes the epic policy disaster that was Brexit. As you take deep breaths, and with your eyes closed, picture the squirming testimony of an aged David Cameron under sustained interrogation. Look on as Boris Johnson is at last called to account for the serial fictions of the 2016 campaign. Or perhaps contemplate the moment the panel delivers its damning, final report, concluding that this was a collective, systemic failure of the entire British political class.Last night’s series of votes in the Commons will provide a rich batch of evidence. Almost everyone involved, from both main parties, showed themselves to be immersed in delusion, trading fantasies and absurdities, each one refusing to meet reality’s eye, let alone tackle it head on.Most culpable, once again, is the prime minister. If our jaws weren’t already slackened to numbness by the last 30 months, they should have hit the floor at this latest performance. Theresa May had repeated endlessly, and for weeks, that her deal was the only deal on offer. Yet there she was, standing at the despatch box urging MPs to vote for an amendment that trashes that very same deal. The Brady amendment, which passed by 16 votes, demands what May had constantly said, up until yesterday morning, was impossible: the replacement of the Northern Irish backstop with “alternative arrangements”. It’s an extraordinary thing, this ability of May’s: she somehow manages to combine grinding intransigence with a willingness to perform the most brazen U-turns.Cheering her on was a Conservative party celebrating the rare thrill of unity. For the first time in ages, they could all be on the same side, declaring with one voice that what they really wanted was May’s deal minus the backstop. They beamed as if this result meant something, when it is in fact triply meaningless.First, it’s really no great achievement to get MPs to agree that they’d like the good bits of a deal but don’t want to swallow the bad bits: yes to the sugar, no to the pill. The Tories have united around a position that says they’d like the benefits of the withdrawal agreement, without paying all the costs.It’s the familiar Brexit delusion, which Brussels took all of six minutes to crush, by declaring – for the millionth time – that “the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation.” In other words, what the Daily Mail calls “Theresa’s triumph” is to have got her party to unite behind a stance that is doomed to fail.But even on its own terms, the vote is hollow. For what did MPs vote for but “alternative arrangements”? Not a specific, detailed counter to the backstop, spelling out concrete ways that a hard border might be avoided, but the nebulous promise of an “alternative”. When you don’t like x, then “not x” looks mighty alluring, not least because it can mean whatever you want it to mean.Brexiteers know the truth of that, because it was that same logic that saw them win the referendum itself. Their message back then boiled down to: do you want to stay in the European Union, with all its concrete, visible flaws, or would you like “alternative arrangements”? What we’ve all learned since is that the moment an “alternative” becomes real, it loses its all-things-to-all-people appeal. Which means that, even if Brussels were to relent and offer a revised proposal to the backstop, the new plan would enrage as many people as it would please – and would likely face rapid rejection by the Commons, by the Brexiteers swiftest of all.But the obloquy should not belong to the Tories alone. MPs had the chance to prevent the national cataclysm of a no-deal crash-out last night – and they refused to take it. They rejected Yvette Cooper’s amendment, which would have made such an exit impossible, thanks in part to 14 Labour rebels who concluded that even a slight delay to Brexit – just a few months – poses more of a threat to their constituents than a crash-out that could see shortages of food and medicine, with more warnings along those lines coming this morning from the leader of a major hospitals group. The future public inquiry into this horror show will damn those 14 especially.Instead, MPs voted for a toothless, non-binding amendment that confirms they don’t like no-deal very much, but are ready to do precisely nothing to prevent it. And while the Tories are still chasing unicorns, Labour is in its own fantasyland. Incredibly, shadow cabinet minister Richard Burgon was on TV last night still mouthing the same vacuities about “Labour’s alternative” Brexit and how it’s going to negotiate a “strong single-market relationship” – all the benefits, none of the costs – as if there isn’t only a matter of weeks to go till Britain leaves the EU. This just 24 hours after the party had embarrassed itself by planning to abstain on Tory legislation ending the free movement of people, only to reverse position 90 minutes later following a backlash on Twitter.The Sir John Chilcot of the future will note all this, even as she or he exempts the handful of MPs who are using every parliamentary wile they can to stop the country from slamming into the iceberg. The names Grieve, Cooper, Boles and others may earn themselves an admiring footnote in the report that will eventually come. But as for almost everyone else: they will be slammed for their role in a saga that disgraces this country and its supposed leaders more with each passing day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c39aae4eae2f4e914991ac9c5d1e78f0a0b1713e/0_216_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0614595e11f48dc4d614ed2f362d7c51","title":"britain schools conversion academies eu","story":"This conversion is in effect privatisation, and more undemocratic than any EU directive – as one school’s story showsSaturday morning, and Stevenage appears to be bracing itself for a riot. Police cars block off road after road. Sirens scythe the air. Officers hurry about in hi-vis. And at the eye of this storm is not some motley crew of furious insurgents, but hundreds of children and mums and dads, marching last weekend to save the school they love.“We are a small town and we aren’t used to staging demonstrations,” says councillor Josh Bennett Lovell, which explains both the law-and-order overkill and the bright-eyed kids enjoying all the excitement of a big day out. Only when the marchers hit the town square does the carnival spirit give way to speeches highlighting the seriousness of their situation.Should these fighters lose, on Friday the Barclay school will be handed over to an academy trust based 35 miles away in central London that has, they say, barely shown its face at the secondary, let alone talked to staff or parents. That will be despite months of protest by the head and governors, a series of strikes by teachers, packed meetings with worried locals, and parents and children taking to the streets. Into the mic roars Pete Hawkins: “We want to work with a partner, not have a dictatorship come in!”With that plaintive shout, the father of two Barclay pupils not only captures this cause, he also shows up the bogus politics that has stalked this country for over two and a half years. How many times have you heard that Brexit is about taking back control, about throwing off shackles made in Brussels and embracing homegrown democracy? Even if that means ministers flirting with the idea of introducing martial law, contracting a ferry service with no ferries or turning a motorway into a lorry park. Anything goes in government today, provided it is done with full ceremonial lip service to the will of the people – the very same people, of course, who the entire political class has spent decades ignoring.Then on an ice-cold Saturday morning along come some of the most ignored people in British politics – residents of a taken-for-granted satellite town – to point out that what’s happening to their school is more undemocratic and untransparent and unfair than any number of Eurocrat directives, and it is entirely the creation of the British state.Because Barclay got a poor Ofsted report two and a half years ago, the government will forcibly turn it into an academy. Which trust it is handed to is determined solely by a Whitehall civil servant. Neither the local authority, nor the school governors, nor the staff – and least of all the parents and pupils – get any say in the process. This is the lawful regime, as set by former education secretary turned defender of democracy Michael Gove.The school was first paired up with a local trust, Herts for Learning, until the government suddenly changed its mind for reasons never properly explained to anyone at Barclay. The Department for Education told me on Monday that the trust – formerly part of Hertfordshire county council’s school improvement service – was “concerned” about its “capacity to absorb the school”. The trust’s head, Alex Thomas, vehemently denies this and says he would take the school tomorrow if he could.Instead, the school was awarded last March to Future Academies trust (Fat), based in central London. In minutes of a meeting released under freedom of information, civil servants admitted to the school that there was no formal process in making the decision. There was “no list” of who had been approached and “no documented evidence”. In this hasty ad hoc fashion the future of nearly 900 pupils was decided – and a 70-year-old public asset, with plenty of land and its own Henry Moore sculpture, was given away.The driving forces behind Fat are Lord and Lady Nash. John Nash’s background is not in schools but in private equity. He has given hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Conservative party, which ennobled him and made him Gove’s academies minister. During that time, you might think, he would have avoided any question of conflict of interest by giving up his own academy trust. He did not.This isn’t democracy. This is a stitch-up. And far from the situation changing after 29 March, the likes of Nash will probably get more schools. Parents have appealed to their local MP to intervene. The Conservative Stephen McPartland posts open letters about how, as a democrat, he believes in pursuing Brexit. But the will of the people when they’re his constituents? Forget about it. When a parent raised her concerns two weeks ago, his response was to tell her to move her daughter to a school in Bedfordshire.The MP didn’t respond to any questions I put, nor did I see him at Saturday’s march. Does he care that schoolchildren were carrying placards reading “I HEART Mr Allchorn”, the new head, who is working wonders? I don’t imagine the DfE cares too much that the school is scoring the best A-levels and GCSEs in years and has won plaudits from Ofsted for its “turnaround”. I suppose that Nash and his trust, waiting in the wings, will claim the credit for the hard work already done to transform a failing school.This entire episode shows you where the true democratic deficit lies in Britain. Not between Westminster and Brussels, but between Westminster and the rest of us. And sometimes it takes a community school to teach us that lesson. Well done to the parents and teachers of Stevenage: they call you a dormitory town, but at least you’re not taking this outrage lying down."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e4202f2308ccd07178a6d5d9612478fa04072a7/0_100_5012_3008/master/5012.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=157205d934f8bee778fed174a9c2f3a0","title":"labour immigration u turn corbyn","story":"We’re here, then. The point at which a Labour leadership that won support for being different ends up being the same. The stage that jaded observers warned was an inevitability of politics, no matter who was in charge. The day that a political project with impeccably pro-migration credentials triangulated into abstention on a miserable, destructive Conservative immigration bill.OK, so it didn’t fully triangulate in the end. Let’s start at the beginning. On Monday, the government’s immigration bill, their flagship legislation for what the country’s immigration policy would be after Brexit, was due a second reading. The Labour party announced in the afternoon that it would be abstaining, in other words, not voting it down. Within hours, after an excoriating backlash from Labour MPs and Jeremy Corbyn’s supporters alike, the party shifted from abstention to a one-line whip – and the government bill passed with 76 Labour MPs absent. This bill, among other things, ends freedom of movement and strips 3 million EU citizens of their rights in the UK, while threatening them with the hostile environment that others are already cruelly subjected to. It also cavalierly hands immigration powers to ministers and puts a £30,000 salary threshold on skilled worker visas for EU citizens – making it unattainable for skilled workers in key areas such as the NHS, social care and beyond. In this context, Labour’s approach to this bad bill really is staggering.Politics-watchers pointed out that Labour abstaining on a bad immigration bill for the sake of later amendments (as the leadership had claimed) was much like Labour abstaining on a bad welfare bill for the sake of later amendments in 2015. That’s important, because the 2015 moment – not unreasonably – is a defining one for supporters of the Corbyn project. It is invoked both as indication of how far the pre-Corbyn leadership had moved away from core Labour values and as a testament to the current leader’s sticking to his principles – he opposed the welfare bill. This tenet has come unstuck somewhat with the immigration blunder.Corbyn supporters have thus far been accommodating, perhaps because in tone, at least, the party has been more pro-migration since he took the helm. The Corbyn-backing grassroots cut him some slack when he spouted bad takes on migrants suppressing wages – such as on the Andrew Marr Show during the 2017 election campaign, when he pledged to stop the “wholesale importation of underpaid workers from central Europe”. Corbyn supporters seemed prepared even to go along with Labour’s horrible, nothing-to-do-with-us-guv, passive-voice desertion of principle in stating “freedom of movement will end when we leave the EU”. Why? Because it was impossible to believe that the leadership team, iniduals who had over many years repeatedly supported migrants and immigration, could ever abandon all that. It’s a theory I’ve heard many times from pro-Corbyn voices: that if the leadership accepted the end of freedom of movement, it was because they had something better in mind as a replacement.Well, maybe there is a better immigration plan – and Labour’s proposal already includes plans to scrap the hostile environment and try to level up non-EU arrivals to receive the same treatment as EU migrants, rather than levelling everyone downwards, as the Conservatives set out. Perhaps there exists an incredible scheme by which ending freedom of movement does not, by definition, create more hostile border controls. But until Labour gets into government to enact its own plan, a bare minimum is opposition to any cruel, regressive stupidity the Conservatives come up with on the issue. Over immigration, much like Brexit, the argument you hear is that the Labour leadership is building consensus within a disparate party of MPs who disagree over these issues. But the backlash from the frontbench and the parliamentary Labour party over the immigration bill has shown that the leadership has more wriggle room than it imagined – perhaps a combination of the Windrush scandal, Brexit and shortages of workers in positions previously filled by migrants has produced a shift within the party in parliament.Still, beyond that, there is the tougher task of shifting a poisonous national conversation on immigration. Labour managed exactly that over economic narratives, but the starting point was different: counter to assumptions from the political and commentariat classes alike, there has long been public support for key Corbynist policies such as renationalisation, infrastructure investment and higher tax. The test of any Labour leadership’s self-styled radicalism is the capacity to change the political climate when the polling isn’t on its side (although attitudes to immigration have softened, post-Brexit vote). Taking on this challenge means letting go of any lingering old-left beliefs that economics will magically eliminate prejudice that redistributive policies alone will tamp down anti-immigration sentiments.But there is another problem here, too, to do with a narrowing of vision at the top. However quick it was to rectify its approach to the immigration bill vote (and a one-line whip is hardly a full-throated correction), only a leadership that has grown detached from its support base could produce such a failure of judgment in the first place. It doesn’t bode well because, put simply, without letting in the lifeblood of its grassroots, this Labour leadership will atrophy. In this context, maybe the migration blunder has been a wake-up call to the Labour movement. Corbyn supporters have seen that, in being vocally critical rather than unquestioningly loyal, they helped force a change in position. That’s something to keep in mind if the leadership strays again from principles it is supposed to hold dear. • Rachel Shabi is a writer and regular broadcast news commentator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9be73f3b80e7be3d4b1c3c19cf74a54bfcd63944/0_50_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcf79d4f2c3cadd71a832192fcefd25b","title":"meghan kate women social media twitter instagram","story":"Kensington Palace has asked Twitter and Instagram for help, but online abuse affects everyone – especially minority womenBeing a royal secures unfathomable perks. Whether it’s getting a £1m home refurbishment gifted by the taxpayer, ownership of all the swans or a lifetime of inherited privilege for you and your descendants, royal status shields the bestowed from life’s mundane troubles. But even a five-metre Givenchy wedding veil couldn’t save Meghan, Duchess of Sussex from misogynoir and a barrage of trolling.This week, Kensington Palace had to reach out for help from Twitter and Instagram, as staff members were spending hours each week reporting sexist and racist comments and threats aimed at Meghan and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge. The diatribe is so dire that Hello! magazine has started a campaign #HelloToKindness.Being a woman in public life is not without challenge. Female MPs, athletes and actors are subjected to abuse on and offline. And both Kate and Meghan have been the targets of sexist criticism on the Kensington Palace platforms and in tabloid comment sections. But it should surprise no one that there has been a spike in hateful comments in October and November, following the announcement of Meghan’s pregnancy.Although a strongly worded letter from Prince Harry in 2016 had put the tabloid media on pause, the reality of a more-melanin-infused royal baby joining the House of Windsor has unleashed the hounds once more. Meghan’s crimes since have been numerous travesties that include cupping her baby bump in public and painting her fingernails. Kate cupped her bump on numerous occasions to no comment. “Sources” also claim Meghan is “high maintenance”, “demanding” and “made Kate cry”.Meghan isn’t the first royal to be hounded by the press and criticised frequently. Diana, Princess of Wales was never far away from a front page and faced intense scrutiny. She was also read as a rebel who didn’t follow protocol. But Meghan has the added bonus of being biracial, which brings with it a different type and intensity of abuse.Social media doesn’t cause online abuse but it is a conduit for societies’ baser beliefs. Online trolling of Meghan and Harry has included six knife emojis and claims that Meghan has bleached her skin to look whiter. A Daily Mail headline referred to her as being from a “gang-scarred” home and “(almost) straight outta Compton”. Comments on the Kensington Palace Instagram called her “trashy” and “ghetto”. Like the recent Sunday Times article that referred to the two schools in “gangland” – known to the rest of us as Newham, east London, where the 2012 Olympics were held – that got a number of black teenagers Oxbridge places, the media, and the trolls that follow them, will associate black people with gangs and crime for the most tenuous of reasons.Racism and sexism are social problems. But social media companies could do more to help protect their users. Celebrities and charities such as Amnesty and Glitch UK are left to campaign for change. After a fortnight of news on self-harm, suicides and Katie Price taking a stand for her disabled son, it’s high time they responded seriously to the abuse perpetuated on their platforms. Otherwise, they risk putting off a generation of women, particularly minority women, from entering public life. All communities need some norms, values and standards to make them safe.

But do we even understand what we’re fighting?This morning, I was in bed, listening to the Today programme’s headlines, including a new Ofcom study that finds children are watching less TV, and more YouTube, although since YouTube is a content delivery platform, a better headline would be, “children watch less telly, in preference for more telly”. My 11-year-old was downstairs, also in bed, watching YouTube. I knew this not because I have any kind of parental surveillance system, but because if he wasn’t, that would mean the internet had broken, and I’d have heard about it.The world of nostalgia can be ided in two: the people who just preferred life when they were young, because it was more enjoyable and those who think the internet is inherently evil, and everything spinning out of it – including the personalities of coming up for two generations – is therefore, also, evil. For those who want to spread terror about screen time – that it can slow development, that it promotes, or at least enables, bullying, that it obliterates boredom and all the constructive thoughts that proceed from it, that it destroys social connections and tugs our young inexorably towards the state of hikikomori, the Japanese “modern-day hermit” – parents are easy meat. We know that screen time isn’t necessary, because we didn’t have it when we were young, unless you count half-watching Monkey and being cast into a pit of obscure martial-arts-philosophy despair. We know that almost everything non-screen related – flying kites, doing embroidery, making slime – is more wholesome. Yet we have – or rather, someone, somewhere has – found a way to take the entire scope of human knowledge and activity and locate it all in one portable device.How do you fight that? Do you even know what you’re fighting? That’s before the hypocrisy freezes your backbone: it’s hard to be sanctimonious when you have your phone in your actual hand, and seems a peculiar kind of bad faith to put your phone down, for two seconds, in order to deliver your homily. I know two families with a solid, immovable code on screen time. One, in the Silicon Valley style, doesn’t let its young near screens of any sort, and doesn’t have a TV. The other has a very low base of minutes-per-day, enough to watch maybe one episode of Gumball, and the children can earn additional screen time with excellent behaviour. The rest of us muddle along in the post-authoritarian style, moaning, cajoling, relenting, getting surprised that Fortnite is actually quite good. As one friend put it: “We have excellent discipline in our family. We do exactly what they say. There’s only ever a problem when we don’t do it fast enough.”That doesn’t mean I’m sanguine: vloggers horrify me. I bulldoze around, going “this person isn’t saying anything”, like a high court judge complaining about the Beatles. There’s a strain of young male vloggers in the Jackass tradition, who go around hurting themselves and others, letting fireworks off in each other’s pants. At least that you can comprehend: a timeless ludic masochism. But then there are people unboxing things, talking about nothing, cooking up theories about Pokémon genitalia, melting stuff.My daughter watches a young woman who has elaborate new-right fantasies about the time she gave a made-up homeless person half her burger and he turned it down, and Jesus, what do these people want? Even though you can find more or less anything on YouTube, what it tends to mean for the committed watcher is an unmediated burble of emptiness. But could I say for certain that it has any less meaning than a radio breakfast show, or the conversations children have with their friends? Or, for that matter, the conversations I have with mine? Is it meaning I want for them, or modernity I abhor? I genuinely don’t know.Raising children is a public and social act, which – in a paradoxical collective fantasy – we’ve recently chosen to conceive of as an inidual and private one. When the world needed obedience and cannon fodder, even the richest raised their offspring cold and hungry, going to the lengths of creating educational institutions in which cold and hunger could be guaranteed. When we were big on liberty and nonconformity, the buzz phrase was “benign neglect”. A Cassandra reading would be that now the world needs consumers, and that’s what we’re producing: gentle passivity, the ultimate spectators.But I know this isn’t right: we’re perceiving the screen itself anachronistically, as being on the wrong side of an old dichotomy between watching (bad) and doing (good) which hasn’t really been meaningful since the 1990s. Silicon Valley has spooked us with its no-screen private schools, its 20th-century parenting rules it is unnerving, as if they had got us hooked on opium, only for their own children to emerge as an untainted superbreed. In fact, what they had created was an instrument that could be active or passive, educational or inane, inspiring or deadening to the spirit, since it contained all things. And you can police its use, but if you do so on the basis that screen time itself is inherently bad, your children will laugh. If you’re still worried, the best way to get children off screens is to let them melt stuff IRL."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fe847ac2e86c03516703ecb54b35500f7145817/0_9_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13eb283eb3a0a91e5c55ab2f6f113718","title":"my canadian food odyssey by chef john quilter","story":"On his six-week journey from east to west Canada, chef John Quilter – AKA The Food Busker – finds a salt beef sandwich that’s 10 days in the making, a killer craft beer brewed with foraged herbs and the best Chinese meal outside of ChinaFor many years, Canada has rented a room in my thoughts, ever since I worked there as a young chef. I spent a summer season in the kitchen of a restaurant in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, when I was 18 and had the time of my life. The people, the countryside, the food, I loved it all, and I’ve longed to go back ever since. Last year, I finally returned on an epic six-week food tour of the country.When you think of Canada, I guess you think of mountains, forest, and bears, right? That’s only half the story, but it’s true: the country has a vast natural beauty on a scale we just don’t see in Europe. As I travelled all over, Canada’s vistas constantly stopped me in my tracks. Just when you think you have seen it all – “Nothing, surely, can top Lake Louise, this has to be Canada’s most breathtaking spot!” – two days later you’re on a ranch in Alberta, riding a stallion, hearing about a cougar or a grizzly bear sighting nearby. Canada makes you look at the world through the eyes of a child. Constantly fascinated, completely immersed.The wildlife I expected, what I was not prepared for was how vibrant and unique Canada’s cities are, and the rich foodie scene that each deserves to be proud of.Time and time again I experienced cultural centres humming and sparkling with the day-to-day life of food shopping, eating out or grabbing a coffee. I was astonished and delighted by the quality of the markets and shops, and Canada’s incredibly strong field-to-plate movement, which ensures the freshest, tastiest raw ingredients. Below are a few of my culinary highlights from the trip.Montréal is a befuddling enclave of Francophone culture in this mainly English-speaking country. The city practically fizzes with fierce French passion and values, which you can’t help but be charmed by. I fell in love with its French-style model economy of independent boulangerie, boucher and pâtisserie.Montréal to me was more than just foodie heaven, it was a blueprint for how a city could be. It’s a city that cares about the little things, such as bookshops, delicatessens, decent coffee and croissants the provenance of goods, and the importance of heritage. Montréal is full of independent shops that have been around for generations. From opening their doors every morning to closing at night, they are committed to the simple idea of creating just one thing of value – a coffee or a salt beef sandwich – and taking enjoyment and pride in the “means”.The aforementioned perfect salt beef sandwich was enjoyed at one of Montréal’s ultimate foodie landmarks, Schwartz’s. The smoked-meat experts have been trading on Saint-Laurent Boulevard since 1928, when established by Jewish immigrant Reuben Schwartz. Unlike many places, Schwartz’s still smokes its meat the old-fashioned way: with a 10-day marinade and then an eight-hour smoke before it’s sliced in front of your eyes. Frank Silva, the manager, has worked here since he was a boy, something I found time and again in Montréal. In an age when there is often little customer or staff loyalty to establishments, I found it truly enchanting.The city also lays claim to the world’s best bagel – or, rather, two of the world’s best. Locally, it is considered an undisputed fact that you won’t find a better bagel than the ones made here, but the jury is very much out over which Montréal institution is superior: St-Viateur Bagel or Fairmont Bagel. Some favour St-Viateur for the honey water they boil their bagels in, while Fairmont is so in demand it stays open 24 hours a day. Both, to me, were perfection – yet another example of the city’s impassioned, artisanal approach to food.Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, has a kicking live music scene, along with a fabulous market culture. The city’s Seaport Farmers’ Market on the waterfront is the oldest continuously operating farmers’ market in North America, the hub for a long list of cheese makers, fruit and vegetable producers, and wine growers from the plentiful farms in the nearby Annapolis valley. At the stall for That Dutchman’s Cheese Farm, I sampled Dragon’s Breath – one of the stinkiest, creamiest, most kick-ass blue cheeses you could imagine.But it is Halifax’s craft beer scene that rivals anything I’ve seen anywhere else. At the Good Robot Brewing Co, the female brew team of Erica Fraser and Kelly Costello create beers with locally foraged herbs and medicinal plants. The list of brews is extensive – on reflection, I may have investigated it a little too thoroughly.And the restaurants also punch way above their weight. I found classic comfort food at 2 Doors Down, where the braised Prince Edward Island beef short rib is knockout, while Halifax’s privileged coastal position also makes it a hotspot for seafood.Ontario in east-central Canada is the province I have spent the most time in over the years, since working here as a teen, and it still feels like a home away from home. Capital city Toronto is such an enthralling city, with so much going on. What sets it apart from other cities is the sheer wealth of its ethnic communities happily living and eating together. It is one of the world’s most multicultural cities – in fact, a survey by BBC Radio named it the most erse, ahead even of London. Just over half of its residents are foreign-born, hailing from 230 different nationalities. This shows in the food scene, a heavyweight collection of authentic ethnic cuisines alongside young chefs developing and modernising traditional flavours.Here, I had stand-out Indian and Vietnamese, while Mexican food is on the rise in a big way. My favourite restaurant, and the one that sums this all up, was Snack Bar 416 (pictured above). A small hipster joint near bohemian Kensington Market, it uses all the city’s main ethnic communities as inspiration, taking one hero dish from each cuisine. Often when this pick-and-mix approach is attempted it falls flat on its face, with compromise and inexperience resulting in bland creations. Not here, not in Toronto.One of the best ways to take the culinary temperature of a city is to see how its various establishments serve brunch. I hit two spots and became addicted to Chambar on the edge of Gastown, the hipster area of the city, and the waffle heaven of Medina, which served incredible dishes with imagination and attention to detail. And then came the holy grail: a killer cup of coffee. Revolver, again in Gastown, is the coffee shop St Peter would open outside the pearly gate. Trust me.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/597305e020ab2ad32cb503da49f25aff335f0cf4/0_432_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a048cd5a81fdd7e6e30a6f0caf192af1","title":"the lowdown on nova scotia canadas seaside paradise","story":"Sandy beaches, snug harbours and (possibly) the best lobster roll in the world.

Please, save me.Me, my deskI don’t know if I have made it clear enough in my several thousand other columns on this subject, but I really, really hate winter. Some people get apple cheeks and cosy knitwear I have a permanent cold and am permanently cold. If I have a cinematic alter ego, it’s Sanka Coffie (Doug E Doug), the dreadlocked bobsledder in the 90s classic, Cool Runnings (all movies with John Candy are classic, don’t @ me), when he comes out of the ice-cream truck in which he has been locked so as to acclimatise to cold weather. The camera pans to him shivering miserably, his dreadlocks so frozen they snap off.I’ve had 40 winters – a biblically long time – of living in London and the even more unacceptably cold New York City, so I’ve had time to come up with coping strategies. Handy tip No 1: don’t leave your house. I don’t leave my home from November to March (April, if I’m entirely honest) and never once have I felt I have missed anything, as I spend another evening in hugging my radiator, carpe-ing the heck out of the diem. So now we can skip past all expectations you might have that I might be about to share coat tips because a) you shouldn’t be going outside anyway and b) it’s nearly February if you don’t already have a coat, you’re beyond my help. Instead, let’s go to my speciality subject: winter beauty products.Obviously, this begins with the most sacred spot in your house in winter: the bathtub. If you’re not having a bath every day in winter, you’re doing it wrong. One of the many reasons I refuse all social invitations in winter is because I don’t have time to go out in the evening, what with my very packed bathing schedule.So that’s how you get through the winter as beautifully as me. Admittedly, no one actually sees me because – and I don’t know if I have made this clear enough – I don’t go outside. But trust me: I look AMAZING.

What comes to mind? Christian Dior never had a pet movie star, like Givenchy had Audrey Hepburn nor a longstanding muse, as Catherine Deneuve was for Yves Saint Laurent. So the odds are, that you think first of all of the New Look suit. The wasp-waist jacket with a full skirt have come to stand for Dior and, beyond that, for fashion itself – the very idea of a must-have New Look. This suit is the first thing you see when you enter Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams, which opens at London’s V\u0026ampA Museum on Saturday.On Monday morning, as the exhibition installation was in its final stages, the head of Dior had arrived from the Eurostar, ready to host the opening parties. Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior’s first female designer, was wearing jeans, black boots, and a thick-ribbed navy sweater under a clean-lined navy cashmere coat. Maria Grazia, as her team call her, wears her short hair bleached and slicked back, her eyes heavily rimmed with kohl, her knuckles encrusted with heavy jewellery. She is not the wasp-waisted, full-skirt type.What the designer, who was born in Rome in 1964, does have in common with Christian Dior, who founded his eponymous house 17 years before she was born, is a love of Britain. This Dior exhibition was first shown in Paris two years ago, but has been expanded by the curator Oriole Cullen to tell the story of Dior in the UK. British society adopted Dior from the start – Nancy Mitford and Margot Fonteyn were two of the 21 private clients who ordered the Daisy suit – a rounder, more decorative version of the Bar from Dior’s first Paris show. Within a year, Dior was staging fashion shows at the Savoy, conveniently close to his preferred Savile Row tailor soon, he upsized to Blenheim Palace.“I love being in a country where the past lies so vividly around me,” he wrote in his memoir, Dior on Dior. (Monsieur Dior raved not only about Savile Row tailoring but also the style of British women and the food.)“From the moment I came to Dior, the link with Britain was very clear to me,” says Chiuri. “People tend to think of the Bar suit as being very feminine, and it is. But when I look at it, what I see is tailoring – really strong British tailoring. Almost severe.”Chiuri has loved London since she discovered the Beatles when was 12, she says. As a fashion student, she talked her way into an early John Galliano show in Olympia. These days, she is a frequent visitor to London, as her 24-year-old daughter, Raquelle, lives in the city. “For anyone who works in fashion at a brand with a history, Britain is fascinating, because it balances modernity with tradition, which is what we try to do,” she says.This will be the first fashion exhibition to be staged in the V\u0026ampA’s new Sainsbury Wing, and the Dior in Britain section gives the show a timely emphasis on the idea of Britishness, and presents Princess Margaret as Dior’s answer to Hepburn or Deneuve. Her status as a fashion icon has been boosted by gorgeous wardrobing in the Netflix series The Crown, presenting Dior with an opportune moment to lay claim to the real-life princess, who wore Dior for her 21st birthday party.“She crystallised the whole popular frantic interest in royalty. The public had chosen well. She was a real fairy princess, delicate, graceful, exquisite,” wrote Dior of the young Margaret. The birthday party dress takes pride of place in the room devoted to his work in Britain, alongside the famous portrait of Margaret by Cecil Beaton.No fashion exhibition staged since Savage Beauty, the world-beating Alexander McQueen retrospective, can escape the comparison. The success of that show put fashion exhibitions on the map by showing museums their potential for pulling in a wider audience. But it is impossible to match for sheer drama, and casts a long shadow. This exhibition has an entirely different emotional tone. There are no shock tactics. All is sunny, pretty and deliciously gossipy – which is not to damn with faint praise it is, frankly, charming.Dior died after just a decade helming the house, and so his talent is not part of the story long enough to be the central focus of this show. Instead, in this sensational line-up of haute couture dresses – every single piece in this show is handmade – we see the work of the stable of designers, including Yves Saint Laurent and John Galliano, who have captained the ship between Dior and Chiuri.It is the creation-myth Dior years, however, that make the case for fashion as an epoch-defining art form. The New Look was not just a trend, it was a vision of Paris reborn in a perilous postwar moment when it was not at all clear that French fashion would be able to reclaim its primacy. Dior became a national hero in France as a result.The cover of Time magazine on which he featured shortly before his death is displayed alongside the Bar suit. A true modernist, he was decades ahead of his time in building a global brand, travelling to Venezuela, Japan and Australia as well as London and New York. In the afterglow of the New Look’s success, he literally bottled his success and sold it: Miss Dior perfume went on sale for Christmas in 1947.The pale grey walls and white columns of Dior’s Avenue Montaigne headquarters have been adopted in the exhibition, adding to the sense that this is a show about a design house, not just a man. Rooms are arranged thematically, from “Historicism” to “Garden”. This doesn’t lend itself to narrative drama, but the Garden room – with hanging paper wisteria and roses, and a bench to enjoy the view of ravishing dresses – is a delight.As a result of the thematic layout, haute couture by Dior and Chiuri is mixed in with the other designers in each room. The Yves Saint Laurent pieces are, in many cases, the most timelessly chic. But it is impossible not to become aware that it is the Galliano pieces to which the eye is immediately drawn. The rest of a group of Egyptian-themed dresses seem to blend into the background when juxtaposed by Galliano’s turquoise python skirt suit with a swollen stomach, paired with the jackal-headed Anubis mask with which it was worn on the catwalk.No mention is made of the ignominious circumstances in which Galliano, who was found guilty of racist and antisemitic abuse in 2011, left the house. To revisit the showstopping dazzle of the Galliano years without context feels a little jarring, in an exhibition that elsewhere embraces the links between fashion and wider society.Chiuri wants to align Dior with modern feminism, and it is Marc Bohan, one of the lesser-known Dior designers, with whom she feels the most affinity. “His work was so contemporary. He had a quote that I love – ‘N’oubliez la femme’ – ‘Don’t forget the woman.’ For me, it’s impossible to forget the woman – I am the woman,” she says. She is “surprised every day,” that she is at Dior and at the V\u0026ampA, she says, “but still, I want more. It is not just about me, as a woman. I want this brand to be about women, and I want this brand to care about women.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eee738bcb6e1a3de6aaf2336e07417239bfa0d48/0_2702_4437_2660/master/4437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=858fd515721bd534c4e58abfa6a589bf","title":"selfie v shelfie fashion interiors backdrops clothes online brands home accessories decor","story":"Eye-catching backdrops are now just as considered as the clothes we pose in online – and more fashion brands are branching into home accessories and decor Forget about athleisure, ugly trainers and logomania, the most dominant trend to have gripped the masses in recent years isinteriors. The fashion world is currently consumed by a homeware obsession – making the “shelfie” the new selfie.It’s not a hard trend to hunt down. On social media, aesthetically pleasing backgrounds now get at least as much attention as the outfits we post photographs of. Elsewhere on our feeds, Peggy Guggenheim’s terrazzo-tiled palazzo in Venice, the quiet sophistication of Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge and the sugary millennial-pink interior of the tea room at Sketch in London are just as likely to be pictured as a new pair of shoes. The hashtag #IHaveThisThingWithTiles has become as commonplace as #TodayI’mWearing, while Le Corbusier is the new Calvin Klein and Charlotte Perriand the new Prada.“It’s a natural extension of accessorising in fashion in the way you might buy something to cheer an outfit up the equivalent is buying a cushion for your sofa or a vase for your mantlepiece,” says Vogue’s fashion features editor, Ellie Pithers. She too credits Instagram for the rate at which we are consuming images of people’s houses, hence increasing our appetite for interiors (witness the Italian fashion brand Bottega Veneta this week releasing its spring 2019 campaign, in which the chrome and snakeskin chair the model sat on stole the show). “The next stage of showing off your good taste is extended to your house.”The new offering from Asos – which self-identifies as “a global fashion destination for 20-somethings” – promises to work, says Pithers, because it is targeting young trend-driven shoppers who don’t have a lot of space or money. “They haven’t focused on big furniture, because their customers are students who don’t have big flats.” Instead, they can “buy a standard sofa from Ikea then beautify it with lots of nice little bits”, such as placing a wicker wastepaper basket, a printed plate or a water jug nearby. River Island’s bestsellers so far – a coaster, a planter and a leopard-print mug –chime with this psychology.That the popularity of interiors has coincided with the rise of the Swedish H\u0026ampM group on the high street is no coincidence. The group capitalised on the mid-century Scandinavian aesthetic – one of the most prevailing interiors trends of this century – by bottling the formula, firstly through its H\u0026ampM Home brand and then with Arket, which launched in 2017. “Arket has been clever,” says Pithers. “The way they have the homewares by the till. Instead of buying a chocolate bar on the way out of the newsagent, you’re buying a little vase or a pack of matches that doesn’t cost very much and cheers you up.”When it comes to fashion, quick-fix, fast interiors are the new food for thought.

Cook this roux on a gentle heat for a couple of minutes until it acquires a sandy texture. Add a small ladleful of the cooled milk to the roux and work it together, on the heat, to form a stiff paste. Strain the remainder of the milk into the paste and bring to the boil, whisking constantly. Simmer this white sauce on a very low heat, whisking occasionally, for 10 minutes. Pour in the cream and egg yolk mixture, simmer for a minute before adding all the gruyere and half the parmesan and then removing from the heat. Whisk the sauce to ensure the cheese melts before pouring into a large bowl and laying clingfilm across the surface.Melt the remaining butter and brush the interiors of the souffle moulds very thoroughly with the butter. Sprinkle the remaining parmesan in the moulds and rotate them in order to ensure an even coating. Place the moulds in the fridge.Preheat the oven to 190Cgas mark 5.Add a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of salt to the egg whites. Whisk the egg whites – preferably with an electric mixer – until they form stiff shiny peaks. Remove the film from the cheese mixture and whisk in a small amount of egg white, whisking vigorously to make a smooth mixture. Now add the remaining white and very gently cut and fold the mixtures together, making the mixture as homogenous as possible without losing volume. Spoon the mixture into the chilled souffle moulds. Smooth the surface with a palette knife before running a little knife around the top of the inside perimeter of the moulds to prevent the mixture sticking to the sides as it rises. The souffles can be chilled for up to an hour in the fridge at this juncture.Pour some boiling water into an oven tray. Place the souffles, spaced apart, in the tray and then bake the souffles for 11-13 minutes, by which time they should be well risen and firm to the touch. Serve immediately.Rowley Leigh is a chef and author of A Long and Messy Business (Unbound, £25)Serves 6guanciale or pancetta 10 slices spaghetti 500g butter a knobblack peppercorns about 1 tspegg yolks 5egg 1young pecorino romano 3 tbsp, freshly gratedChop the guanciale or pancetta.Begin to cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling salted water. In a sauté pan, heat the butter, then put in the guanciale or pancetta and fry until golden and crispy. Take off the heat, and lift out the guanciale or pancetta to a warm plate, so that it stays crunchy.Put the peppercorns into the pan and crush with a meat hammer or the end of a rolling pin, then add a couple of spoonfuls of the cooking water from the pasta and stir it around to take up all the bits of guanciale or pancetta which may have stuck to the bottom of the pan.Beat the egg yolks and a whole egg in a warm bowl with the grated pecorino romano.One minute before the spaghetti is ready, start to mix in a ladleful of the cooking water at a time until the eggs and cheese become creamy.Drain the pasta (but reserve the cooking water) and toss it in the pan of pepper, together with the reserved guanciale or pancetta.Add a little more cooking water if the pasta seems too dry, then transfer it to the bowl of eggs and cheese and toss well, until coated in the silky mixture. The heat of the spaghetti will cook the eggs without scrambling them. Add more black pepper, if you like.From Made at Home by Giorgio Locatelli (Fourth Estate, £26)Serves 2 for breakfast, lunch or dinnerolive oil 3 tbsp leek 1 small, sliced into rings and washedfresh spinach 100g, washed (you can use any green leaf you have here: chard, kale, beets, radish tops, etc)parsley 1 small bunch, roughly choppedmint 1 small bunch, leaves picked and roughly choppeddill 1 small bunch, roughly choppedgarlic 1 clove, peeled and crushedeggs 4 yogurt a few dollops (optional)sumac a sprinkling (optional)sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to tasteHeat the olive oil in a frying pan (I use a 22cm frying pan) on a medium-high heat. Add the leek and sauté to soften – it will take 3-4 minutes – then start adding the spinach, a large handful at a time. Stir between each addition to wilt it. It may seem as if it will never fit in the pan, but as it wilts there will be hardly any volume left. Finally add the chopped herbs and mix them in to wilt, too. The whole process will take about 6-8 minutes, depending on the leaves you are using just make sure they are soft by the end of it.Remove the frying pan from the stove and season with the garlic and some salt and pepper. You can set this aside until you are ready to eat and the table is set it will also keep in the fridge until later.You only want to cook the eggs once everyone is at the table, as it is best to eat this while the yolks are still runny.Heat the spinach mixture again and use a spoon to create 4 little wells in the cooked leaves, one in each quarter. Crack an egg into each well, season the eggs with a touch of salt and pepper and cover the pan. Cook on a low heat until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny – about 3-4 minutes. Serve straight away. You can drizzle with some yogurt and sumac or serve it as is. It’s delicious either way.From Honey \u0026amp Co At Home by Sarit Packer \u0026amp Itamar Srulovich (Pavilion Books, £26)A custard tart is one of the finest puddings – crisp pastry filled with a rich, wobbly custard and topped with grated nutmeg. I usually like it best in its simplest form, but when raspberries, rhubarb or sweet, juicy cherries are in season, they make an excellent addition, creating little pockets of fruitiness and an even prettier pudding just leave out the nutmeg.Makes 1 tart, serving 6-8For the sweet pastryunsalted butter 80gcaster sugar 50gfine sea salt a pinchegg yolk 1plain flour 160g, plus extra for dustingFor the custardegg yolks 7 caster sugar 50g double cream 450ml vanilla pod 1 nutmeg for gratingTo make the pastry, mix the butter and sugar with a pinch of salt in an electric mixer or in a large bowl with a hand-held blender, until smooth and creamy.Add the egg yolk and continue to mix so it is well combined.Add the flour and mix briefly, then scoop the mixture into a clean bowl, add a tablespoon of cold water and, using your hands, bring the pastry together. Add another tablespoon of water if necessary to form a cohesive but firm dough. Wrap in clingfilm and allow to rest for at least an hour or overnight in the fridge.On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry until it is large enough to fit a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin. When ready to make your tart, line your tin with the pastry, keeping any offcuts in case you need to plug any holes after blind baking.Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes while you preheat the oven to 150Cgas mark 2.Line the pastry case with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake blind for 15 minutes. Remove the paper and beans and return to the oven for a further 15 minutes, until golden and sandy textured. Leave to cool while you prepare the custard.In a large bowl, whisk the yolks and sugar until the sugar has dissolved. Put the cream into a pan, slit the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape the seeds into the cream. (Place the empty pod in a jar of caster sugar to make vanilla sugar.)Heat the cream until it just starts to come to the boil, then pour it in a thin stream into the yolks, whisking as you do. Return the whole mixture to the pan and heat very gently, stirring continuously, until it thickens slightly.Strain the custard into a jug. If there are any lumps in the custard (caused by cooking it at too high a temperature), give it a whizz with a handheld blender until it is completely smooth.Pour the custard into the baked tart shell and return to the oven for 35-40 minutes or until the filling feels firm but still a little wobbly to the touch. Grate the nutmeg all over the surface and allow to cool completely. (The custard will set further.) Once cooled, cut and serve.From Egg by Blanche Vaughan (Weidenfeld \u0026amp Nicolson, £22)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/358f329a10767ef7a070c7d65ce76ed469d627fa/0_487_2002_1201/master/2002.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d118af6c20e738db40404302d68a3da1","title":"cardiff city emiliano sala sol bamba","story":"Sol Bamba has said some of his Cardiff City teammates are scared to fly after the disappearance of Emiliano Sala. The captain laid bare the depth of anguish that has gripped the club and community, describing it as having affected everyone.Sala, who signed for Cardiff in a club-record £15m deal from Nantes, was on board a single-engined private jet that has been missing in the English Channel since Monday of last week. A crowdfunded search operation continues for him and the pilot David Ibbotson.Cardiff returned to action in the Premier League at Arsenal on Tuesday night, playing well but losing 2-1 after a buildup that was shaped by sessions with a psychologist as much as anything on the training pitch.“It’s very difficult to even describe the emotions,” Bamba said. “It’s something unusual, a big tragedy, and we’ve all been affected by it – the lads and the city, the whole club. I think we needed this game to get back to normal but it’s been a very, very difficult week.“We travel with planes and everything and some of the lads were maybe thinking they don’t want to go on it anymore. It was that deep. The gaffer and the club have been good in terms of bringing someone in to talk to if we need it and a few of the lads have needed that to get it off their chests.“Obviously before the game, there was a feeling of ’let’s do it for Sala’. The gaffer said if anyone didn’t feel like playing, just say it and he wouldn’t hold it against them. But the lads all wanted to play for him and for the club. Credit to everyone.”Bamba shares an agent with Sala and had told the 28-year-old all about the club and the challenge that awaited him in England. “I spoke to him before he signed,” Bamba said. “He asked about the club, the dressing room, would he fit into the team, what the gaffer and the city are like. I told him only good things and he was looking forward to it.“He came to visit the stadium and the training ground. He’s been talking to the lads to say hello and he was definitely part of us. We feel like we’re missing him. Obviously I have a personal connection with him through my agent but I can’t say I feel more sad than the other lads. The fans never met him but what they did for him was remarkable. We’re sure we’ll never forget that.“We said back home that where there’s life, there’s hope and you never know what is going to happen. The search continues and hopefully we can find something good for the family, in particular. I’ve got kids myself so I can imagine how the family feel.”Cardiff, who are third from bottom in the table, return to their home stadium on Saturday to face Bournemouth. “Our home form has been better and we fancy ourselves against anyone there,” Bamba said. “It’s going to be very emotional but as soon as the game starts we’ll be professional and try to do a job and make sure we win because it’s going to be a very important game for us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef7ce5d162e7f508195d9a52d2d7f6d2df7eb3f3/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaa553834a15cd0f5217685f49d2e586","title":"neymar injury miss manchester united games champions league","story":"• Brazilian will miss both legs against Manchester United• Club backs player to overcome injury with ‘courage’Paris Saint-Germain have said that Neymar will be out for about 10 weeks with the metatarsal injury he suffered against Racing Strasbourg on 23 January.The news will come as a blow to the French club as they prepare to face Manchester United in the Champions League, with the first leg to take place on 12 February at Old Trafford and the second on 6 March in Paris.The club will be less worried about their attempts to win Ligue 1 as they are 13 points ahead of Lille, having played two games fewer than the second-placed team.A club statement said: “After detailed analysis by the specialists, a consensus was reached of a conservative treatment of Neymar’s injury to the fifth right metatarsal.

Yannick Carrasco’s agent, Christophe Henrotay, has been speaking to RadioRossonera about his client’s future at Dalian Yifang. It sounds like he’d like Arsenal or Inter to show a little more urgency if Carrasco is going to leave China. “Everything is possible,” he said, “but it seems difficult because interested clubs don’t have a lot of time left to discuss a deal with Carrasco’s current club.” The clock is very much ticking. And with that, Gregg Bakowski is back for the afternoon - email him on gregg.bakowski@the.Schalke have included a €50m buy-out clause in Rabbi Matondo’s contract, according to Kicker. The German magazine says that the Welsh teenager has completed his medical at the Bundesliga club and that he has signed a contract until 2023. Kicker says Schalke are paying City €9m for the player, who is likely to be thrust into first-team action immediately. Away from transfer news for a moment - and a breaking news story: Two seat cushions have been found which are likely to have come from the plane carrying missing Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch have said. An underwater seabed investigation is planned for this weekend.Nuremberg have dipped their toe in the transfer market for the first time this January, while Sandro Wagner (remember him?) has done one from Bayern Munich. Who, what, to where, when? It’s all here in our all-singing, all-dancing interactive transfer guide.Swansea City striker Wilfried Bony’s ill-fated second spell at the club is drawing to a close with reports the striker is on his way to Qatari club Al-Arabi on loan. He is set to join them until the end of the season with Swansea pleased to get their highest earner off their hands. Bony originally joined the club from Vitesse Arnhem in July 2013 for £12m before leaving for a disappointing spell at Manchester City for £28m. He returned to Wales for £12m in 2017 but injury and poor form has hampered his prospects there.Denis Suárez is in London where, if he successfully coughs for the doctor in his Arsenal medical, he should complete a loan move that will cost the Gunners around £2m with an option to sign him permanently for just under £22m in the summer. I’m going to grab some lunch, so I will leave you in the very capable hands of Tom Bryant. Is Peter Crouch set for a return to the Premier League on his 38th birthday? Various sources are reporting that Stoke are willing to offer cash and Crouch for Sam Vokes, the 29-year-old striker but are unwilling to meet the outright £9m that Burnley want. Crouch could pretty much be a specialist sub when a team wants to throw the kitchen sink at the opposition in the last few minutes of any match. He could go on for a while yet. And wasn’t he bizarrely linked with Chelsea this time last year?Some news for Pilgrims fans: Plymouth Argyle are close to agreeing a loan deal to bring towering centre-back Lloyd Jones back to his hometown club, who he played for as a youth player before joining Liverpool for £150,000 eight years ago, where he was earmarked as being the “next Carragher”. He’s still only 23. Here are the stories on Neymar’s injury (mentioned earlier) and news that Serie A has been ditched by Eleven Sports: There’s been very little news on Idrissa Gueye today, though reports that Manchester City have joined the race do not tally with what Pep Guardiola said after the defeat by Newcastle. “During the month I said we were not going to do anything in the transfer market. We were clear as a club that we were not in the transfer window. I’ve said it five times. It’s finishing.”Matt Polster got away from Chicago Fire in good time. It’s -29c there. January in Glasgow will feel like the Bahamas. Told a deal for Maxi Gómez is “very much alive” for the summer. Sounds like West Ham are optimistic of getting a deal done for the Celta Vigo striker. Not agreed yet, though. A few moves in and out of MLS now, starting with Atlanta United, who are set to receive £20m from Newcastle for playmaker Miguel Almiron, who posted a farewell message on Instagram a few hours ago. Atlanta are expecting Paul Pogba’s brother, Florentin, to imminently sign a one-year deal. The defender is a free agent and has turned down the chance to join Elche in Spain. And Rangers have signed Chicago Fire’s USA defender Matt Polster on a two-and-a-half-year deal after the player impressed Steven Gerrard in a trial. “Rangers are today delighted to confirm the signing of Matt Polster subject to international clearance. The 25-year-old can play both at right-back and in midfield, and has been capped once for the United States national team,” said a club statement. Anthony Martial may be closing in on a new contract with Manchester United, according to reports in France. If the 23-year-old does sign on again it will be a remarkable turnaround given how José Mourinho wanted to sell him in the summer.While Martial’s current terms end in summer 2020, talks are also ongoing with Juan Mata regarding the Spaniard extending his stay at the club, which began in January 2014, when David Moyes signed him from Chelsea.Sky Sports in Germany are reporting that a deal has been done between Manchester City and Schalke for the £11.3m transfer of 18-year-old Wales winger Rabbi Matondo, who has got into a car amid the snow after completing a medical in Gelsenkirchen. New Huddersfield striker Karlan Grant has been speaking about how he hopes to grasp the opportunity after joining for £2m from Charlton.Ever since I was a boy I dreamt of playing in the Premier League, it’s what every kid dreams of. It’s a dream come true. I’m going to enjoy this. I’m not going to come here and hide. I want to showcase my talent and see what I can do on the big stage.You can watch him plundering goals for Charlton in this unveiling video too: West Ham are close to sealing a deal with Celta Vigo for Maxi Gómez after agreeing to let Celta Vigo keep the forward until the summer, according to Sky. It means they may get him for about £3m less, so £40m instead of £43m. The deal appeared to be off last night but perhaps patience has paid off for the Hammers. Some more big news from France now. PSG have confirmed that Neymar will be out for 10 weeks with a suspected broken metatarsal, meaning he will miss both legs of the Champions League tie with Manchester United and, if they were to win that, maybe even the quarter-finals and semi-finals too. The helpful folk at Get French Football News, who have a weekly column with the , have rounded up the transfer news in France, some of which affects the likelihood of Yannick Carrasco moving to Arsenal or Inter. Monaco are involved heavily again (obviously). Cardiff City have been rejected by 22-year-old Dijon right-back Valentin Rosier, but a deal for Monaco defender Almamy Touré remains in the realms of possibility before tomorrow’s deadline.PSG are selling teenage midfield prospect Yacine Adli, who they fought so hard against Arsenal for the Frenchman to sign a professional contract with them instead this summer, to Bordeaux for €5.5m plus bonuses. RMC speculate that Les Parisiens are sanctioning the move to raise funds to sign Idrissa Gueye from Everton.Shinji Kagawa has given the green light for a loan move to Monaco from Dortmund until the end of the season. Monaco VP Vasilyev was proposed the player earlier on in the window, but has decided to move now. The 29-year-old should arrive in the principality today.Olivier Giroud turned down a €10m-a-year proposal from Dalian Yifang yesterday - the Chinese Super League club want to sign an attacker in order to let Yannick Carrasco go. Have also had a €40m bid for French international Alassane Pléa (Gladbach) rejected, according to L’Équipe.”Aston Villa are four points off the playoffs and seem to be incredibly keen to bolster their ranks for a promotion push in the second half of the season. Villa boss Dean Smith has been told by Burnley that Ben Gibson is going nowhere so they will have to look elsewhere for defensive reinforcements. They want some midfielders too, and Watford’s Nathaniel Chalobah and Newcastle’s Isaac Hayden are on their radar. Hayden is said to be unsettled on Tyneside and would like to move further south to be closer to his family in Wales. “Stade Louis II Stadium? Is the stadium so nice they named it twice?” asks Hubert O’Hearn. You decide Hubert …Anthony Martial’s future at Manchester United looked bleak under José Mourinho, but he is close to signing a new five-and-half-year deal to stay at Old Trafford now he is playing under master of good vibes, Ole Gunnar Solskjær. His wages would be boosted to around £190,000 per week. The 23-year-old has scored 10 goals this season and still looks like he has more to give. Reports are emerging that Inter may do battle with Arsenal for Yannick Carrasco. Having knocked back the Gunners’ approaches for Ivan Perisic, if they jumped in ahead of Arsenal for Carrasco it would feel like they were doing it just to spite them! Or, more likely, could Carrasco going to Inter free up a move for Perisic to Arsenal? Bad times for West Ham. They were dreadful as they suffered a third consecutive defeat last night, losing 3-0 to Wolves, and also lost Marko Arnautovic to a foot injury. The forward celebrated his new deal by leaving Molineux on crutches and with a protective boot on his sore foot.The injuries are piling up. Samir Nasri and Aaron Cresswell were absent last night and it remains to be seen if they’ll return to face Liverpool on Monday.What to do? Well, Danny Drinkwater on loan from Chelsea is emerging as a possibility …“Are Monaco becoming the ‘Theseus’s Ship’ of clubs?” ponders James Knight. “If a club loses their manager, and most of their key squad players over the last few years, are they still the same club?Also, what if the original captain of the ship returns? Who even are Monaco anymore?!” Monaco have always appeared to be a kind of idea, rather than a tangible thing. I often think I’m dreaming when I see football being played in the Stade Louis II Stadium, such is its otherworldly appearance. Monaco appear to be at the centre of this transfer window. Like a deep-lying transfer-window playmaker, every move appears to be going through them. Sky in Germany are reporting that Borussia Dortmund’s Shinji Kagawa is on his way to Monaco to rubber-stamp a loan deal. Kagawa is still only 29! So, if he can find a little bit of his old magic he could be a very decent signing. His move may hasten the departure of Tielemans to Leicester, too. Watch this space. Paul Pogba may be an injury doubt for Manchester United’s trip to Leicester City on Sunday, after the midfielder limped away from Old Trafford following Tuesday night’s draw with Burnley.Pogba scored United’s first goal, an 87th-minute penalty, as Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s team came from two behind - Victor Lindelof’s added time equaliser securing a point.While Pogba finished the game he was later seen walking with apparent discomfort as he left the stadium. The draw was the first dropped points under Solskjær, coming in his seventh league match in charge.Pogba said: “The comeback was positive but the result was disappointing. The reaction was good, we didn’t lose, but we dropped two points we could have won.”Newcastle is suddenly a very lively place to be. While Rafa Benítez’s side were busy beating Manchester City last night, his admin bods were completing a deal for left-back Antonio Barreca from Monaco, as confirmed by Fabrizio Romano. Benítez is also licking his lips at the prospect of having playmaker Miguel Almirón in his squad after agreeing a club record fee of around £20m for the 24-year-old Atlanta midfielder. He is expected to arrive on Tyneside today to undergo a medical and finalise personal terms. Mike Ashley parting with £29m for non-retail related acquisitions? Who would have thought it? Oh, and reports suggest they’re also in talks with Benfica over a move for midfielder Andreas Samaris. Heady days for Rafa. You can catch up on all the transfers involving clubs in Europe’s leading leagues with our snazzy interactive. You can even filter it down to focus on one club’s January deals. A move you may have missed last night involves Jesé Rodriguez, who has left PSG for Real Betis on loan. His career has noseed since leaving Madrid for PSG for £21m. Maybe he will rediscover his missing mojo in La Liga. Over to Germany now, where Bayern Munich forward Sandro Wagner has agreed a move to Chinese Super League side Tianjin Teda. The 31-year-old joined Bayern from Hoffenheim last January, having started his career in the Bavarian club’s youth ranks. Wagner has eight caps for Germany and was part of the squad that clinched the 2017 Confederations Cup. The forward, who has played for a host of Bundesliga clubs including Werder Bremen and Hertha Berlin, has made only 12 appearances for Bayern this season, scoring one goal in the German Cup. We have a done deal! Huddersfield have shaken off the defeat by Everton and got about their business early this morning. They need someone who can score goals in the Premier League or Championship. And they have signed fox-in-the-box Karlan Grant from Charlton for a fee believed to be around £2m to try to plunder them. Grant has signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with the Premier League’s bottom side, who have an option to extend the deal by another season. The 21-year-old has scored 14 goals for Charlton in League One this season. New Huddersfield boss, Jan Siewert said: As I do, this club believes in talented young players and Karlan certainly fits that description. He’s a player I’m delighted to have the chance to work with. Our recruitment team has put a lot of work into bringing Karlan here. Importantly, he is a natural goalscorer. He has that knack of knowing which movement to make and finishing chances. He offers us something different to our current options in that he always tries to play on the shoulder of the final defender, looking to run in behind. He’s an athletic, pacey player and will really fit our playing style.The window shuts tomorrow! Will things liven up a bit? Well, maybe. Manchester United’s Marouane Fellaini is close to a £10.4m move to Shandong Luneng Taishan, who are willing to shovel over £200,000 a week (after tax!) into the Belgian’s bank account for his services. Barcelona’s Denis Suárez may turn up in London to seal his loan move to Arsenal. Luis Suárez pretty much waved him on his way on Tuesday night, saying on Twitter: “Good luck little Galician in this new challenge.” And I’m assuming he wasn’t talking about a new jigsaw puzzle that his namesake is doing. Arsenal’s attempt to bring Ivan Perisic to the Emirates appears to be at an end but they have reignited their interest in Yannick Carasco, according to Sky Italy. The 25-year-old Belgium winger is said to be unhappy at Dalian Yifang, in China, and would like to get his career up and running in a more competitive environment again. The Gunners have reportedly opened talks with the Chinese Super League club. Idrissa Gueye has attracted interest from PSG, but Manchester City and Arsenal have joined the race for the scurrying Everton midfielder’s signature. Citymay finally have twigged that beyond Fernandinho (who didn’t have his best night at Newcastle) they’re a little light in the ball-winning department. And Monaco’s Youri Tielemans appears to be heading to Leicester despite late interest from Spurs. He’s likely to join on loan with Adrien Silva going the other way. There should be an option to buy Tielemans for £20m in the summer too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77fba5b5b0a82d29d3b94b0eeb6ffcbe185fa1d9/0_478_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cffa6a61225b0e0e7a66ab381d550d69","title":"miracle method sustainable rice scientists dismissed","story":"The fragrant jasmine rice growing on the left side of Kreaougkra Junpeng’s five-acre field stands nearly five feet tall.Each plant has 15 or more tillers, or stalks, and the grains hang heavy from them. The Thai farmer says this will be his best-ever harvest in 30 years and he will reap it four weeks earlier than usual.It is very different on the other side of the field. Here, Junpeng planted his rice in closely spaced clumps of 20 or more seedlings in shallow water just as he, his father and millions of other small farmers across south-east Asia have always done. He used the same seeds but the conventionally grown plants are wind-battered and thin, and clearly have fewer, smaller grains.Junpeng is part of a pilot project to see if it’s possible to grow more rice with less water and fewer greenhouse gases. The dramatic difference between his two crops points a way to help the world’s 145 million small rice farmers, and could also greatly reduce global warming emissions from agriculture.The project, backed by the German and Thai governments and by some of the world’s largest rice traders and food companies, has seen 3,000 other farmers in this corner of Thailand’s “rice basket” near the Cambodian border trained to grow sustainable rice according to the principles of a revolutionary agronomical system discovered by accident in Madagascar in the 1980s.When it was first employed outside Madagascar in 2000, the system of rice intensification (SRI) was dismissed  by a handful of scientists who questioned the legitimacy of the reported increased yields. But since then, it has evolved and been developed by peasant farmers working in many different climates around the world.Academic criticism has since all but disappeared and the SRI system of farming has been validated in hundreds of scientific papers and adopted by up to 20 million farmers in 61 countries, according to the SRI information centre in Cornell University.“The results consistently cite yield increases, decreased use of seed, water and chemicals, and increased income,” says Norman Uphoff, professor of global agriculture at Cornell.Vietnamese, Cambodian, Nepalese, Filipino, Indian and African farmers have all reported large increases. In 2011, a young Indian farmer broke the world record for rice production, harvesting 22 tonnes from a single hectare (2.47 acres).The Thai farmers who took part in the Ubon Ratchathani trial say they are delighted. Says Khampha Bunchansee from Noan Dang village: “It was very easy to learn. I will use the extra money to invest in a tractor. If I can do it, anyone can. Everyone can come and learn.”“I applied more fertiliser on my conventional crop but it produced lots more leaf but not more grain,” says Wanna Sriwila, also from Noan Dang. “Now I bring other farmers to see what can be done. Seeing is believing.”But what is now exciting some of the world’s largest food corporations and governments is that growing rice along SRI principles also greatly reduces emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane, which escapes when rice, or any other crop, lies waterlogged for weeks at a time.The urgency to act for the global good, self-interest in maintaining production and the possibility of accessing money to reduce farm emissions has now led heavy rice-using food companies like Mars and Kellogg’s, and the agri-business colossus Olam, to set up the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP).This coalition of companies, NGOs and governments sets the world’s first voluntary sustainability standards for rice growing. It adopts the basic SRI principle of planting seedlings further apart, and keeping them moist rather than flooded, but adds targets and measurements to provide consistency.“With another two billion people we cannot carry on the way we are. We must go beyond what is currently being done and achieve far more at greater scale. We must re-imagine the whole food supply chain if the world is to become carbon neutral by 2050,” he says.“But reducing emissions from rice cannot be a trade-off that hurts farmers and communities who depend on it for their income and sustenance. We have to measure the true cost of food and dismantle the subsidy system.”“The SRI revolution is happening. People are changing their practices and you can see SRI in the field in many places now. There is no reason why SRI should not become normal agronomic practice,” says Styger.“But there is no long term funding. If we want to make it mainstream it needs to get to a critical mass. We are left with breadcrumbs, with only short-term project finding,” she says.“The food system is broken. Olam on its own cannot fix it, we can only change it. We can’t do it overnight but there is a new way of collaborating. Companies must change and reduce their resource intensity. The whole food sector must change,” says Verghese.“What is needed now is large retailers to brand SRP. It’s the way we can reduce emissions, use less water and grow more. Win. Win. Win.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b34dc34165c231284abeacec142013efbc38b2c/0_3382_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9011cede453f0ce4b2605372740e63b4","title":"young or old tell us about the major life events that shaped you","story":"We would like to hear from you as part of a project introducing readers of different generations to one anotherAs part of a new project that aims to explore major life events from different perspectives and across generational ides, the ’s Weekend magazine is looking to hear from readers.If one of the following questions apply to you, we’d like to hear from you.

We have no further comment to make in this matter.”The links between Lebedev’s media businesses and Saudi Arabia have grown substantially over the past two years, despite concerns over the autocratic kingdom’s approach to journalists, especially after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.In 2017, Lebedev sold one-third of the Independent to a Cayman Islands company controlled by an obscure Saudi-based inidual called Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel. He stated on official forms that he was making the investment in a personal capacity, but he also works for NCB Capital, a ision of a bank ultimately controlled by the Saudi government.According to the FT, the recent anonymous investment in Lebedev Holdings was made by a Cayman Islands company founded by the same agent used during the Saudi investment in the Independent.The Independent last week launched the first in a series of spin-off foreign-language websites funded, written and edited by a Saudi publishing company with close ties to the royal family.This was despite concerns from some staff about the impact this could have on the neutrality of the main English-language website, whose editor, Christian Broughton, has previously flown to Riyadh to discuss the deal, although the Independent said it has appointed iniduals to oversee the new site’s editorial output.Last year, the Evening Standard ran an unusual and lengthy dispatch from the war in Yemen, in which the newspaper obtained substantial access to Saudi-backed militias.The piece failed to mention Lebedev had accompanied the reporter on the trip, with many staff only finding out the newspaper’s proprietor had been involved in the story when he posted pictures on Instagram of him posing with soldiers.Lebedev and his oligarch father, Alexander Lebedev, bought the Independent and the Evening Standard for £1 each a decade ago. The national newspaper has since gone online-only. The London-only newspaper briefly boomed under its free model, but has struggled financially in recent years due to the rising cost of newsprint and a declining print advertising market, recording a loss of £10m in 2017, which coincided with the shock appointment of Osborne as editor.The anti-corruption organisation Global Witness has called on Lebedev to come clean about who is behind the substantial offshore investment.“Last year, the government voted to end this secrecy in the UK’s overseas territories, including the Cayman Islands, where this company is registered. But these islands are dragging their feet. If the government is serious about ‘taking back control’, we must know who is really behind the curtain.”The paperwork relating to the outside investment in Lebedev Holdings was filed on 27 December, shortly after the resignation of the long-serving Lebedev employee Justin Byam Shaw from the holding company’s board.Lebedev, 38, has a luxurious lifestyle, regularly flying celebrities out to his Italian villa and attending London theatre events. He also turns his hand to journalism, where he is fond of writing pieces on the need to save elephants.Last year, Lebedev was appointed creative director of the Evening Standard magazine’s theatre awards photoshoot, taking the decision to place himself in the photos alongside the actors Claire Foy and Idris Elba and Vogue’s editor, Anna Wintour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/572cc68e53639f0d4c61e1e7ca48e147c717e599/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=106a297fdffd34764d00924e9fac46be","title":"low review tramway glasgow","story":"Tramway, GlasgowThe Minnesotan trio blend their recent electronic experimentation into their brutally beautiful aesthetic, offsetting despair with sweetnessIt has been hailed by some critics as the masterpiece of Low’s 26-year career, yet 2018’s Double Negative ought to present the Duluth, Minnesota slowcore indie-rock lifers with a dilemma. How will they recreate the sound of their most adventurous record to date – a product of studio-as-instrument experimentation, a harshly textural triumph constructed with dolorous drones, raw static hiss, ragged noise and swirling electronic bass whomps – live in concert?Unfazed guitarist and vocalist Alan Sparhawk, his drummer and vocalist wife Mimi Parker and bassist Steve Garrington render opener Always Up – the cautiously optimistic centerpiece of Double Negative – with a tender clinch of softly beaten toms, crunching distortion and harmonies so close it’s as if they’re fastened with Velcro. Low have never been a band likely to break out synths, drum pads and sequencers all of a sudden. They blend Double Negative in among their wider oeuvre and aesthetic, performing selections from their previous 11 albums under its brutally beautiful spell.

His most garrulous moment as frontman comes amid a funny back-and-forth with Parker, in which they apologise for furtively texting mid-show: it’s -25C back home and they’re checking that their son and their house are OK. “Put a heated fan on your plumbing,” suggests Sparhawk.Few artists have a hotline to paranoia, discomfort and sorrow such as these restless midwesterners. The hazy sweetness in Sparhawk and Parker’s intuitively interlocking voices is like the life raft to which hope clings in a sea of despair, whether whipped by the winds of the starkly gorgeous Tempest or beating against the monochrome blues of Always Trying to Work It Out. What Low choose to leave out of their rigorously considered arrangements gives power and potency to what they put in. The instrumental passage of Do You Know How to Waltz? – Low’s comparatively understated equivalent of the fabled “holocaust section” in My Bloody Valentine’s You Made Me Realise – is teased out on one guitar string by rapid movements of Sparhawk’s thumb, before rising almost imperceptibly to a crescendo that makes the floor tremble. In such company, the languid melody of Lies is practically a bubblegum pop song.With vast riches of material to choose from – Double Negative arrives after a run of strong records ning more than a decade – there’s no obvious place to end, and yet the closing number could scarcely be more perfect. “We’re going to end with something a little more positive,” says Sparhawk. “This is about eternal love.” In Low’s intense and sepulchral world, this means Sunflower, the first track on their 2001 masterpiece Things We Lost in the Fire: a song that starts with the discovery of a loved one’s lifeless body and concludes with an enchanting floral tribute to the night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e438fd3a9e2a7f0009581f1713fab34a06e6c096/0_89_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f58bf6fb7d61fa6722235cfd4cc88eb8","title":"could speaker john bercow block brexit podcast","story":"Today is the day that backbench MPs in parliament could wrestle control of the Brexit process away from the government.

This morning I feel totally scunnered, a citizen of nowhere. We are all being played, no deal is the endgame where the wealthy will make financial killings. That’ll be the warm up act to destabilisation of the EU and God knows what after. The arms dealers must be rubbing their hands with glee. And we all are collateral damage, at best. I loathe politicians. tlswimmerWe are witnessing a government that is intellectually and morally bankrupt. The PM flies to Brussels on a completely pointless trip, to speak to people who do not want to talk to her, because she has to be seen to be doing something. The government uses dubious tactics to fend off legitimate challenges, the Labour opposition proves once again just how impotent it is, and the Tory press tout it as a triumph for the government. What we are seeing is no more than the twitching of a corpse. Terry PotterWatching this yesterday, it appears that, with a number of notable and honourable exceptions, our MPs have joined in a form of collective insanity, earnestly discussing the number, size and temperament of the unicorns Treeza must bring back from Brussels, all the while ignoring the detailed report that declares the whole of the European continent to be a unicorn-free zone. It must be clear to almost everybody that ‘alternative arrangements’ on the backstop roughly translates as ‘we’ll blag it and hope no-one notices’, which may be OK in Westminster but could lead to violence in NI and Ireland. MrCosmopoliteTo the extent that I’m British I can only feel ashamed at the arrogance and stupidity of this country. To the extent that I’m not, I can only feel angry about my decision to live here and commit money and effort to the place. The sooner I can get out the better, but as it is for business, so it is with families: the costs and losses involved in doing so are considerable. LastNameOnTheShelfSo parla-la-la-iament has voted for the latest fantasy to avoid the Tory Party from splitting. May has another two weeks being PM. Jacob Rees Mogg is another two weeks nearer his dream of a no-deal Brexit so he and his other hedge fund friends can make themselves richer unfettered by any EU directives. And vote-leavers can live happily ever after, even if they are poorer. Us remainers have been ignored again and if, as expected, the EU refuse to reopen negotiations then the blue press will have the headline they always wanted - that it is all the EU’s fault. It looks like we will be forced to go it alone before we can see who is right or wrong. TheDudleyOmmerPlease - going back to Brussels is nonsense. Labour in opposition totally outmanoeuvred in the political playground by the current prime minister. Corbyn is dust, Labour finished. Theresa May won’t stand for re-election and so it will go on post no-deal Brexit. Spencer Leonard WainThe Tories only squeaked a very narrow majority for a switch to the right by imposing a three-line whip on the party, meaning that any minister or junior minister who voted for Cooper-Bowles or against Brady would lose their government job - and any backbench Tory MP who did so would leave themselves open to deselection by their constituency party, egged on by Tory Central Office. The real battle will be when May comes back to the House on 14 February with whatever limp ‘alternative arrangements’, if any, she has been able to cobble together. If the nutters in the European Research Group won’t buy it, the Tory Remainers may have one last chance to demonstrate that they do actually have a backbone - if indeed they do. cripes2How is it possible that Corbyn comes out the bigger loser from last night’s latest episode of the Brexit farce? It surely requires a leader of exceptional ineffectiveness to have presided over last night’s debacle. The Labour party’s role has been absolutely woeful throughout Brexit, right from its failure to campaign strongly for remain in 2016. NowThatYouAskThe serious miscalculation here is that Britain hasn’t recognised the cost to the EU of the single market losing its integrity. In the eyes of the EU, having a blurry border in Ireland sets a precedent that makes their other external borders impossible to defend. This poses a greater cost and a greater risk to the whole of the EU than does a no-deal Brexit and for this reason they will not move. London has miscalculated. stuart255The UK signed up to the Good Friday Agreement after years of hard work to bring about and sustain peace in Northern Ireland and Ireland. Yesterday we saw parliament vote to refuse to accept May’s deal with the EU if we don’t have the right to renege on the GFA, which apparently parliament wishes to do, otherwise why kick up such a monster fuss over something we don’t want to do. So, parliament wants to scrap the GFA so we can make some trade deals. Can we sink any lower?

It comes two weeks after Corbyn rejected the prime minister’s invitation on the grounds that she should first rule out a no-deal Brexit.After a morning of negotiations, Corbyn will meet May in the relative privacy of her office in the Commons at 3pm, according to Whitehall sources. The location means that Corbyn will not be walking up Downing Street, a location that would have given him the opportunity to make a statement outside No 10 afterwards.Interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Barclay said: “The vote was last night, the PM will be meeting with the leader of the opposition later today, there is an ongoing process … We are working hard in the national interest.”After parliament voted on Tuesday for a renegotiation of the Irish backstop and rejected the idea of leaving without an agreement, Corbyn said he would meet May to hold talks on how to move forward.The Brady amendment demands that the backstop arrangement in the EU withdrawal agreement to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland should be replaced with \u0027alternative arrangements\u0027. The backstop is hated by many Tory Brexiters because it would keep the UK in an effective customs union until an alternative solution could be found to prevent the need for infrastructure at the border. The backstop has no time limit and exit can be only by joint agreement between the UK and the EU.\u0026nbspBrexiters would like to see the backstop replaced either by an as-yet-unknown technological solution to ensure a smooth border or at least an end date or a unilateral exit mechanism.In order to seek this from Brussels, Theresa May decided the government should back an amendment tabled by Sir Graham Brady, a Tory backbencher, which said the backstop should be replaced. She also pledged to reopen the withdrawal agreement and change the text.\u0026nbspThe European Union has been adamant that both things cannot happen, but Downing Street believes that gaining a majority in the House of Commons for the change would demonstrate the crucial breakthrough needed to avoid a no-deal Brexit.After initial scepticism, members of the hard-Brexit European Research Group swung behind the government, though Tory remainers rebelled against it, and the amendment passed by 16 votes. However, the group has made it clear it will not necessarily back whichever compromise she may come back with.The Labour leader told the House of Commons he would have talks with the prime minister because “parliament has voted to remove the immediate threat of crashing out without a deal on 29 March”.The decision to hold the meeting follows internal pressure on Corbyn from some of his closest aides. One senior party source said: “If we want to avoid a no-deal Brexit, there has to be some level of negotiations between the parties. We have to be involved.”At the meeting, a Labour source said confirming rejection of a no-deal Brexit would remain a key issue. “Jeremy will insist that the will of parliament is respected and that no deal is now off the table,” he said.Corbyn will also push Labour’s Brexit plan, which envisages a customs union, a strong single-market relationship and a guarantee on workers’ rights, consumer standards and environmental protections.“That now must be the focus for negotiations,” the source said.Two weeks ago, May wrote to Corbyn urging him to take part in meetings with her and other ministers following the rejection of her negotiated deal on the withdrawal bill.Corbyn dismissed the invitation as a stunt. In a speech in Hastings, he said: “With no deal on the table, the prime minister will enter into phoney talks just to run down the clock and try to blackmail MPs to vote through her botched deal on a second attempt, by threatening the country with the chaos that no deal would bring.”They previously met to discuss the Brexit process in November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fc785742328cfebb9b976c37d8b67f271c4a360/15_0_853_512/master/853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f89e22d4deb948dc003e30e4384acc1","title":"theresa may can no longer be trusted european press condemns pm","story":"Papers say Theresa May is aiming to provoke conflict with EU after ‘utterly absurd’ Commons scenes European media and commentators were damning about the latest twist in the Brexit saga, accusing Theresa May variously of weakness, desperation and cynicism in putting party before country – and warning she could no longer be trusted.“To avoid the disintegration of her own Conservative party, Theresa May is now risking a major showdown with the EU and increasing the danger of a damaging no-deal departure,” writes Le Monde’s London correspondent, Philippe Bernard.“Two months before the orce date, she hopes to question two years of discussions with the EU27 – ditching her own handiwork.” British MPs sent two contradictory messages, the paper says: “One majority rejected no deal another mandated May to begin a renegotiation so hypothetical as to risk that very no deal.”As for the prime minister, she made her strategy very clear, Le Monde concludes: “As risky as it is, she intends to run down the clock so as to force the EU27 into making concessions before 29 March. And then, if necessary, blame the EU – an easy scapegoat – for eventual failure.”In Germany, Björn Finke in the Süddeutsche Zeitung says the most promising way forward for May would undoubtedly be to approach the opposition Labour party with concessions on a permanent customs union. “But that would lose her the support of hardcore Brexiteers in her own party, and risk splitting the Conservatives,” he says.“Since May lacks the courage and the leadership to take such a step, she prefers the seemingly simpler way: renegotiation. Brussels cannot trust her promise to win a majority if changes are made to the deal. May does not have her own party under control. May’s weakness is dangerous, for Britain and for the rest of the EU.”In an opinion piece for El País attacking May’s “startling disloyalty”, Xavier Vidal-Folch says bluntly the British prime minister “can no longer be trusted. Not because her judgment and arguments lack depth, but because she changes them at every step.”It is true that this “worries the Europeans”, Vidal-Folch says. “That’s why they’re drawing up contingency plans, which only remind them of the losses ahead. But those who’ll suffer the most damage are the British themselves.“The car industry, banks and technology sector are all putting the finishing touches to their own partial or total ex-Brit plans. It’s not abstract markets that will tip the balance, but real businesses, inventors, professionals and doctors. Because May can no longer be trusted.”NRC Handelsblad in the Netherlands is equally brutal. “To save her Brexit deal, avoid a split in her party and retain the minimum of control a prime minister needs, May aims to provoke a conflict with the EU,” it says.“What has not proved possible in the past two years now has to be sorted in a fortnight, before the next parliamentary vote … The job looks impossible there is a very high risk of May returning empty-handed. In which case, a no-deal Brexit will be a real probability: the moment of truth approaches for British politics.”In Italy, La Repubblica says Tuesday’s votes in the Commons “revealed, more than anything else, the general refusal to take responsibility for the economic disaster that an exit from the EU without agreement would be. Nobody wants to be left holding the Brexit baby. Two and a half years after the referendum, we are back at the starting point. And it’s 60 days until Brexit.”Libération, France’s leftwing daily, detects a familiar British strategy behind Tuesday evening’s “utterly absurd” scenes in the Commons. “From now till mid-February, aided by the Eurosceptic press, she can deploy the classic British rhetoric: those intransigent, arrogant Europeans are refusing to give us what we want.“Then she can say, ‘I tried, but this is the only deal on the table.’ She is counting on fear of a no deal to win MPs round. It’s a very big gamble, and it could backfire, lamentably.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6873ce922b363b952307fbb076b5d2cd7c9f67d3/0_0_2371_1423/master/2371.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93f11f8fa49156afc568113484196889","title":"theresas triumph what the papers say about the brexit amendment vote","story":"Pro-Tory titles spinning the outcome as a great success for the PM, but others warn the EU won’t be budgedThe papers are split on their treatment of the latest make or break day of Brexit drama in parliament with Conservative-supporting titles trumpeting the Commons deal as a success for Theresa May.But the , FT and Mirror emphasise the problem May faces in negotiations with the EU, which has said that the Irish backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement and cannot be undone.The Mail’s treatment is typical of the more pro-Tory front pages and calls it “Theresa’s triumph” as the PM “revived her hopes for a Brexit agreement”. The paper also notes that she “crushed” Jeremy Corbyn by seeing off a Labour amendment to win a vote on its Brexit policy. The Express is even more convinced that the outcome of the votes represent a significant change in fortunes for the embattled PM weeks after she suffered a humiliating Commons defeat on her Brexit deal.“She did it!”, the paper screams, describing May as our “indomitable PM” who has achieved “one of the most remarkable turnarounds in political history”.The Sun declares “Backstop from the brink” in its splash headline. It says Theresa May now has the “wind in her sails” to go back to Brussels and demand changes to the Irish backstop. It was a double triumph, the paper says, because she also managed to defeat Yvette Cooper’s amendment to delay Brexit.It also reports that May has completely caved in to hardliners in her own party by agreeing to shakeup her Brexit negotiating team. She will now include Julian Braithwaite, the UK’s permanent representative to the UN and WTO in Geneva, and Crawford Falconer, the chief trade negotiation adviser at the Department for International Trade.The Times is more measured and says that the PM has united the Conservative party around a potential new deal – but warns that EU might not be in the mood to budge.The  also shapes its story with the prime minister on the offensive and runs the headline saying “May takes the Brexit battle back to Brussels”. has a different approach and says that May caved in to her rebel MPs by accepting the Brady amendment and taking the talks back to Brussels despite facing unanimity from the EU that there will be no concessions on the backstop. Over a picture of May addressing MPs, the headline says: “May goes back to Brussels but EU says: nothing has changed.”The FT also stresses the complications ahead with the headline: “May’s move to rewrite Brexit deal sets collision course with Brussels.”And the Mirror says “May’s deal back from the dead … for now” but notes that if there are no changes forthcoming from the EU then Britain will be leaving with no deal on 29 March.The Scotsman says “May wins backing of MPs for last-ditch Brussels push”, while the Independent plays on the time difference between the Commons vote and the EU slapping it down. “8.41pm MPs send May back to Brussels for a new deal, 8.47pm Brussels says no,” runs its headline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48550ed3ddacaa26b3e05857d95fc146afb877c8/0_39_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8005d219a3c496919238ddfda6ef7d6f","title":"brexit theresa may given two weeks to renegotiate irish backstop politics live","story":"As Theresa May girds herself for renewed talks with the EU about changing the Irish backstop, follow all the news and reaction with our live blog These are from Sky’s Tom Boadle.Sir Oliver Letwin, the Conservative former cabinet minister who was one of the supporters of the unsuccessful Yvette Cooper amendment last night, which was intended to rule out a no-deal Brexit, told Radio 5 Live this morning that he did not think Theresa May’s attempt to renegotiate the backstop would succeed. He said:I don’t actually think it’s at all likely that that will succeed. And I think it’s much more likely that if we’re to find a deal before 29 March, it will have to be done on a cross-party basis.In his speech at the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) in Dublin, Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister, also ridiculed that idea that “alternative arrangements” could replace the backstop, as the Brady amendment passed yesterday proposes. He said:There are currently no alternative arrangements, which anybody has put forward, which achieve what both sides are determined to achieve - to avoid a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks or controls, and protect the all-island economy, North-South co-operation and the Good Friday agreement. Believe me, this has been explored endlessly in the negotiations over the last two years.We have seen no alternative arrangements that meet this essential threshold. We need a backstop or insurance mechanism based on legal certainty, and not just wishful thinking.This is from the ’s Steven Swinford.The claim that Crawford Falconer, the international trade department’s chief trade negotiator, and Julian Braithwaite, the UK’s representative at the WTO, were going to be drafted in as part of the Brexit negotiating team was included in a Sun story this morning.Brexiters have been calling for Falconer to be more involved for some time. They argue that he cannot be expected to mastermind trade policy if he is not involved in the discussions about the UK’s future trade relationship with its biggest single market, the EU.UPDATE: This is from the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn.Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, has warned it will not be threatened into abandoning the backstop arrangement for the Irish border, comparing Britain’s latest Brexit moves to an ultimatum from someone threatening to jump out the window. My colleague Lisa O’Carroll has the full story here.PMQs - Snap verdict: Has Brexit fatigue finally reached the House of Commons? It certainly felt like that. After a night of high drama, that led to Theresa May being applauded as a hero by the rightwing press for winning a vote by capitulating to the ERG and abandoning a deal she spent more than a year negotiating, it felt as if MPs - like much of the rest of the country - had finally had enough, and were anxious to change the subject. It wasn’t that the Brexit crisis was totally ignored. But it did feel as if there were far fewer questions about it than normal.And you can see why, because whenever it did get raised, all we heard were the familiar platitudes that made it feel like Groundhog Day - although I’m sure in Groundhog Day there was more variation. The best question was posed by the SNP’s Ian Blackford, who in his opener (see 12.22pm) cleverly highlighted just what a whopping U-turn May exercised yesterday evening. Other interesting questions came from MPs who tried to get May to acknowledge that the passing of the SpelmanDromey amendment last night rejecting no deal meant that a no-deal Brexit was now off the table, but May sidestepped them all in such a way as to make it impossible to glean any more about whether she would, or would not, be willing to contemplate such an outcome.Jeremy Corbyn devoted all his questions to Brexit and he focused on one of the government’s greatest weaknesses - its inability to say anything substantive about what the “alternative arrangements” it wants to replace the backstop will actually entail. But May could see this coming, and - by her standards - gave an unusually full answer to Corbyn’s first question, rattling off various possibilities. In reality, these are little more than bullet points that have already been dismissed by the EU, but Corbyn did not deploy the forensic firepower needed to make that apparent, and May survived those exchanges mostly unscathed (although his joke question about the new technological solutions that might emerge in the next 58 days was a good one). Corbyn ended with a very reasonable point about the need for the government to find a Brexit solution around which the country might unite, but May’s glib retort about his failure until now to even talk to her about Brexit got her off that hook too.In a PMQs that was unmemorable even by recent standards, perhaps the real takeaway was how pointless these MayCorbyn talks are going to be. He was already rehearsing his lines about May being unwilling to reach out to businessunion opinion. And she devoted a large chunk of one of her replies to regurgitating her critique of Labour’s Brexit policy. They would both save time by calling it off, and asking Keir Starmer and Stephen Barclay (less abrasive types) to have a chat instead.Labour’s Liam Byrne asks about a homeless man who died in Birmingham. Homelessness is a “moral emergency”, he says.May says the government is taking action across the country to deal with it.Bob Blackman, a Conservative, asks May to join him in praising volunteers who work with the Holocaust Memorial Trust. May says she is happy to praise them for what they do. We should all be fighting against antisemitism wherever it occurs, she says.The DUP’s Nigel Dodds asks May if she agrees the language from the Irish government, about uniformed guards at the Irish border, or Brexit being like jumping out of a window, is highly reckless.May says she will be speaking to Irish PM later today. She says both sides want to maintain their commitments under the Good Friday agreement.Labour’s Siobhain McDonagh asks about a family in her constituency being forced into temporary accommodation. May says she will ask the relevant minister to look at the case.Mark Harper, a Conservative, says he could not vote for May’s deal originally, but he is glad that she will renegotiate the backstop. He says he hopes Tory MPs will give May space. The EU will not crumble tomorrow, he says.May says winning the vote gave “a very clear message” to the EU that a deal can go through the Commons.Labour’s Marsha De Cordova says MPs vote against no deal last night. Ordinary people would be most affected by a no-deal Brexit. Will May categorically rule one out?May says MPs rejected no deal. She says she hopes De Cordova will play her part in avoiding one by voting for her deal.Maggie Throup, a Conservative, asks about schools and educational performance.Simon Clarke, a Conservative MP, asks May to take seriously the Malthouse compromise Brexit plan. May says the government is looking at what it proposes.Labour’s Jack Dromey says we are 58 days from a cliff. If we plunge over, the country will be poorer. Last night MPs voted for the DromeySpelman amendment rejecting no deal. Will May honour that?May says MPs voted to reject no deal. But they also voted for a deal. That is what we should be focusing on, she says. She says the Commons can only avoid no deal by having a deal.Labour’s Stephen Hepburn asks about World Cancer Day, and what can be done to provide more help in his constituency.May says the relevant minister will meet Hepburn to discuss this.Douglas Ross, a Scottish Conservative, asks if May agrees Moray needs a fairer funding settlement.May says it is the SNP goverment that decides how much money councils in Scotland get.Labour’s Stephen Morgan asks about the closure of a department store in his constituency.May says the business department will work with the company involved.

Damian Penaud, France. Has made the move from centre to wing for Clermont this season, appearing out wide more often than not, and that is where he stays for France. A classy operator with a habit of making yards in heavy traffic and an eye for a try.I can’t wait for … Craft and imagination to prevail over power and physicality. If we are constantly talking about brutality and intensity the tournament will be all the poorer for it.Who will win? Ireland. England should be more competitive, Wales and Scotland capable of shaking things up. There is no obvious reason, bar the risk of injury to Conor Murray andor Johnny Sexton, for thinking Ireland won’t be the team to beat.Key game? Scotland v Ireland. Scotland have three home matches and a winnable trip to France in the first four rounds. They will beat Italy in the first, then it is Ireland in the second. That will make or break their confidence.Most important player? Johnny Sexton. It’s almost always the fly-halves, isn’t it? Owen Farrell is by far England’s Sexton (a little ahead of Murray) is Ireland’s Finn Russell is Scotland’s (because he is so inconsistent). Taulupe Faletau is probably Wales’s, but he is injured. So Sexton.Breakthrough star? Darcy Graham. Christian Wade, Shane Williams, where art thou? Graham is the latest to blaze a trail for the regular-sized guy. The 21-year-old from Hawick is 5ft 9in and, depending on who you believe, between 11 and 13 stone. But he can move.I can’t wait for … All of this to be reduced to nothing more than a qualifying competition for the League of Nations. Please tell us Agustín Pichot’s vision for international rugby is nothing more than a bad dream.Who will win? The grand slam champions France beat the world champions New Zealand in November and are the only threat to England. France have a strong pack but the English forwards are well drilled by the former Leicester lock Richard Blaze. Ireland in Dublin this Friday will be a tough test for Simon Middleton’s squad, though.Key match? England v France in Doncaster on Sunday week is the pivotal game of the tournament by a country mile. England are still smarting from their last-gasp defeat in Grenoble last March and the Yorkshireman Middleton is particularly looking forward to a tilt at revenge in the tightly-packed Castle Park ground.Most important player? Safi N’Diaye, the Montpellier back-rower, will be at home when the Six Nations champions open their account against Wales on Saturday night. The 30-year-old is powerful and quick and will be a threat at the breakdown.Breakthrough star? England’s front-row rock Rochelle Clark has departed but the prop Hannah Botterman, a 19-year-old painter and decorator from Luton, made a splash in the autumn Tests. The Saracens forward is a powerful ball-carrier who won’t take a backward step.I can’t wait for ... An Italian renaissance. Italy have never finished better than third in the Six Nations but the full-back Manuela Furlan, who took over as captain in November, can spark a revival when she leads her much-improved side in Glasgow this weekend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b42aff1afacea9c82c2b6a2d1072aa57480521e4/86_0_4666_2800/master/4666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d1f480fa7c69ca3ef02bcc04f27dcc2","title":"saudi arabia sportswashing golf european tour saudi international justin rose","story":"In a flawlessly manicured instance of cosmic timing, last Sunday saw Justin Rose become the sixth golfer to surpass $50m in PGA Tour earnings. With his win at the Farmers Insurance Open in San Diego, Rose now sits on a total of $51.02m, and counting. That, however, does not include his European Tour earnings, which currently stand at a further €27.25m. And counting.These thrilling moves in his balance sheet have turned out to be the perfect curtain raiser to confirmation that Rose would absolutely be playing in the inaugural Saudi International. Indeed, he couldn’t really even stick around to celebrate Sunday’s win, what with having a plane waiting to take him on the first leg of his long journey to the Saudi west coast. The tournament’s prize fund stands at $3.5m though Rose and others are reported to have been paid up to $1m by way of an appearance fee. As for what to conclude, I guess this is just the latest iteration of that age-old question: how much golf is enough?The event will take place at the Royal Greens Golf and Country Club in the lyrically named King Abdullah Economic City, which evokes vistas of … well, the Saudi royal family and money. It is, as mentioned, a brand new date on the European Tour, which is forever scrambling to keep up with its PGA counterpart.The decision to allow Saudi Arabia to host a tour event is a hangover from the period when all sorts of people amusingly believed that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was a good egg, in the reforming mould. Without wishing to nitpick, you will recall that this unearned reputation took something of a dent after the murder and dismemberment of one of his critics, the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October. Ever since the CIA concluded that the so-called MbS directly ordered the murder, there has been a widespread sense that Prince Mohammed’s good guy costume needs a little work.Yes. That bit’s not difficult to understand, Keith. Understanding the wider issue of sportswashing ought not to be beyond your ken, either. As Amnesty has warned: “It’s clear that countries like Saudi Arabia are well aware of the potential for sport to subtly ‘rebrand’ a country.”Naturally, other excuses are available. Having also decided to make the journey, Ian Poulter has gone with: “I’m probably not the most educated man in the world to sit down and have a discussion about politics.” Oh please. Poulter is perfectly bright, and you really don’t need to be a political science professor to get that chopping someone up in an embassy may place the perpetrators in the “guys whose money I shouldn’t take” file.Of course, it must be said that Justin hails from a country – the United Kingdom – which is vastly more unforgivably enmeshed with Riyadh, and which continues to sell billions of pounds of arms a year to the Saudis. In the scheme of things, then, should Rose and the European Tour really be held to higher standards than the UK government? The answer, in an ideal world, is no. But in a realistic world, imagine not WANTING to hold yourself to a higher standard than the UK government – currently the international standard for talentless post-moral dysfunctionality.Still, let’s play out with arguably my favourite take on it all, which emanated from the American Patrick Reed. Asked if he had any safety concerns about visiting Saudi Arabia, last year’s Masters champion dismissed the idea. “No,” breezed Reed, “because the European Tour has us covered.” On the one hand, yes. It feels vanishingly unlikely that anything unpleasant would happen to golfers paid to burnish Saudi Arabia’s dismal image. On the other, if the chips do go down, and you want a really crack unit to have your back covered, who you gonna call? The SAS, Delta Force, Seal Team Six, or… hang on, what was it again? … ah yes. The European Tour. Veteran of zero deadly missions, but several increasingly daring sorties into enemy coffers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7abcb513de494415d56fd1a4fd4897483a551056/341_1049_1315_789/master/1315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afee0df34e64ede132305b2d65fe2644","title":"woah canada 25 years of cirque eloize in pictures","story":"The acclaimed Montreal troupe are on tour to celebrate a quarter-century of astonishing shows, performed for more than three million people around the world.

When they did, all of their internet data, however they connected and whatever app they were using, was funnelled through the company’s servers, allowing it to keep track of their activities on other services.Onavo Protect was used by the company for the same purpose but was removed from the iOS App Store in June 2018 when Apple implemented new rules that banned the collection of “information about which other apps are installed on a user’s device for the purposes of analytics or advertisingmarketing”.Facebook Research avoided Apple’s enforcement of those privacy rules by asking users to install it using a feature called an “enterprise developer certificate”, which is intended to allow companies to build applications for internal use without needing to publish them to the App Store.In a statement, Facebook hit back at the reporting. “Key facts about this market research program are being ignored. Despite early reports, there was nothing ‘secret’ about this it was literally called the Facebook Research App.But Will Strafach, the developer of  Protect, an iOS firewall (unrelated to the  newspaper), described the move on Twitter as “the most defiant behaviour I have ever seen by an App Store developer … I still don’t know how to best articulate how absolutely floored I am by Facebook thinking they can get away with this.”Addressing the issue of consent, Strafach acknowledged that Facebook said users were provided with “extensive information about the type of data we collect and how they can participate”, but argued that “they do not inform users of the massive amount of access you hand them when hitting ‘Trust’ on their root certificate. I do not think users can reasonably consent without this knowledge.”Facebook also said that the program was not built to replace Onavo, arguing that it started in 2016, while Onavo was only removed from Apple’s App Store in 2018. But the market research program appears to have been only active on Android from 2016 to 2018, with the iOS version launching after Onavo was pulled. Indeed, according to Strafach, the app reportedly contains numerous references to Onavo in its code.Already, some are speculating that the decision to bypass Apple’s approval process could lead to an escalation in the conflict between the two companies. John Gruber, an Apple blogger with an inside line to the iPhone maker, speculated that it could even result in the Facebook app being pulled off the store in retaliation.“To my eyes, this action constitutes Facebook declaring war on Apple’s iOS privacy protections,” Gruber wrote. “I don’t think it would be out of line for Apple to revoke Facebook’s developer certificate, maybe even pull their apps from the App Store. No regular developer would get away with this. Facebook is betting that their apps are too popular, that they can do what they want and Apple has to sit back and take it.”Facebook declined to comment further to the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f60bed32e542702e53173f5efae55a7f37992a8/0_178_5480_3289/master/5480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f9abe8eed96d077ed6ab26515b3b4a9","title":"tesla factory elon musk layoffs company","story":"Alan Ochoa worked at Tesla’s Fremont plant in California for four years. He was laid off recently along with his entire department in quality control, many of whom were also long-time employees. “I have no idea how they expect to run without us,” said Ochoa.Ochoa predicts Tesla’s “difficult road” will not be helped by laying off experienced staff.He said: “My last repair on Friday was finding a rear fascia was missing a screw so if you pulled on it, it would pop out. I grabbed a drill, the screw, got down on my knees and made the repair myself. No one would have known about it unless they tugged on the edges of the rear fascia like I had made it a habit to do.“But I know once the car starts driving it would become unseated due to the wind pulling it out.”An internal document provided to laid-off employees explained those who were dismissed were selected “by evaluating the criticality of each position, identifying duplicate roles, and by assessing the specific skills and abilities of each inidual in the company”.Workers past and present believe Tesla is trying to cut costs by getting rid of more expensive, and experienced, staff. The company disputes this.Tesla has a one through five pay ranking system for employees. Five represents the most senior.Anthony Lamendola worked at the Lathrop facility, also in California, for nearly seven years before being laid off.Lamendola, who was also level five, said: “They let all the people go who have been there level rive or more, all level fours and threes, only kept one, two, some threes. I’ve never been late, never called in, never been wrote up in over six years. I’m just am in shock for them to do this and keep temps and new hires.”A current Tesla employee at Lathrop who requested anonymity for fear of losing their job, noted temporary employees and recent hires were kept on, while many long-time employees were laid off as part of the cuts. “This was a move I was expecting due to the high price of raw metal from our president’s tariff war with China,” the worker said. “Tesla Lathrop has a large amount of people that wanted to go union.”Back at the Fremont plant, a current employee who has worked for over four years at the plant was transferred to work on car seats as part of restructuring. He noted many transferred employees took hourly pay cuts, and a few walked off the job as a result.“It seems like they tried to get rid of the older, more experienced guys making more money than the entry level. I personally see and feel this is aimed at the higher-waged employees,” the employee said. “They replaced me with a $19 an hour worker. I make $26 an hour.” He was told his transfer would be a lateral move and wouldn’t include a pay cut, but he’s still wary that his pay will be reduced from changing departments.“I loved Tesla at one point. But four and a half years of living what I lived through, I don’t feel the love, what a good, dedicated employee should feel from a company.”Another employee at the Fremont plant noted that dozens of newly hired workers started training the week after the mass layoff, and that there was also an elimination of overtime. “You get in trouble with one minute of overtime, which is counter-productive because you have people wrapping up earlier than they normally would so they don’t risk going over,’ the worker said.A Tesla spokesperson said: “We are continuing to hire for essential positions.” The company denied senior and high-waged employees were targeted in the layoff.The cuts have been severe. A third employee at the Fremont plant explained his department was cut in half, with the employees who survived this round of layoffs forced to do even more work.“We’re going to have to take over their positions,” the employee said. “We have to do our job, plus the contractor job. Usually we have to work for two people, now, we’re going to have to work for three people.”Tesla has suffered quality control setbacks in the past and workers fear those issues may be worsened by the cuts. Ochoa explained he was making several dozen repairs a day on quality control, depending on what line he was on.He said: “I fear the quality will be greatly diminished. Not all of my repairs were easy to see but would have a lasting effect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90270428458355a05e7908a89241a11bd817c654/0_229_4277_2567/master/4277.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e927ec58f2d66b019f429d7fc2644591","title":"backpackers guide to uzbekistan itinerary tashkent samarkand bukhara","story":"Explore Silk Road heritage, deserts landscapes, Tashkent’s metro and the cities of Samarkand and Bukhara in a country encouraging tourists with new, relaxed visa policiesFrom the blue-tiled mosques of Bukhara to the remote semi-autonomous region of Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan offers ancient culture and ample opportunity for adventure. Highlights include riding Tashkent’s glitzy metro, admiring Silk Road-era architecture and strolling Samarkand’s backstreets. Add to this Uzbek hospitality, as warm as it is heartfelt, colourful festivals and the fact you’re following in the footsteps of the greatest travellers and conquerors in history and there are all the ingredients of a riveting trip. Getting into the country, and getting around it, is now much easier. There’s less bureaucratic hassle, plenty of excellent English-speaking guides, an expanding and efficient rail network and, crucially, the abolishment of visas for many European travellers. British passport holders can enter Uzbekistan for up to 30 days without a visa from 1 February.Overlanders may cross one of many borders from a neighbouring ‘stan but the capital, Tashkent, is the most common entry point. Begin centrally, at the Amir Timur statue (that’s 14th century Turco-Mongol conqueror, Tamerlane, cast in bronze, on horseback), marvel at the hulking Hotel Uzbekistan, then buy a token for the Tashkent  (about 10p). Modelled on the Moscow , it’s all marble, chandeliers and carved alabaster (have your camera ready, photography restrictions were lifted early in 2018). Alight at Kosmonavtlar station, dedicated to Soviet space travel (look out for Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space) and visit the Museum of Applied Arts for a primer on silk weaving, Uzbek hats (tubeteika) and local ceramics. Take the metro to the Old Town’s sprawling Chorsu Bazaar and wander lanes full of dairy goods, dried fruit and pyramids of vegetables. Buy a takeaway bag of salad and a roundel of Non bread. Stay at the affordable Art Hostel (dorms about £10, economy double around £18)). Tashkent deserves a few days, don’t rush off.Next, head to the Fergana Valley for 3-4 days. Take the morning train to Margilan (£4, five hours), the hub of Uzbekistan’s silk industry. Arrive at lunchtime and go to the Yodgorlik Silk Factory to see master weavers working under mulberry trees and, if the fruit-filled Kumtepa Bazaar is on, (Thursdays and Sundays), visit that, too. Next, take a shared taxi (two hours) to historic Kokand. Visit its impressive mosques, try some local halva (sweets) and see some of the 100 or so rooms at the Khan’s Palace. Stay at Hotel Kokand (doubles £30), then, for a slice of village life, daytrip to little Rishton (45 minutes, shared taxi) for the famous pottery workshops and the Rishton Ceramic Museum.Continue to Andijan (also Andijon), a laid-back city with a decent bazaar (Jahon) and museums but infamous for the horrors of its 2005 massacre. One taste of Fergana’s celebrated melons and you’ll see why Babur, founder of the Mughal Empire and the city’s son, missed them so in India. Overnight at Hotel Andijon (doubles £30, +998 74 2237040). Train back to Tashkent (around five hours).From the capital, bag a seat in a shared taxi and travel an hour north to Chimgan national park. If it’s summer, spend a few days hiking there taking in rock paintings, waterfalls and wild tulips. Oleg Shelamonov (ast.uz) can arrange multi-day walking tours. In winter, skiing is an option.Zip back to the capital and take the speedy Afrosiyob train to Samarkand (£5 in economy two hours) and get your fill of towering and resplendent turquoise-tiled madrasas and mosques. Emir B\u0026ampB is keenly priced (doubles £25, +998 91 314 02 59, no website) with views of Gur-e-Amir, Tamerlane’s mausoleum. At night, have a beer at the atmospheric Blues Café (Amir Temur Street, +998 66 233 62 96, no website).Next, escape the tour groups by heading north to the Nurata Mountains, taking shared taxis via Navoi, and spend a few days hiking and overnighting at yurt camps such as Sputnik (£30pp including meals, camping.uz). Try a camel ride and relax at the Chashma Spring, home to holy fish.Bukhara next. This is the most romantic of Uzbekistan’s cities with former merchant house B\u0026ampBs, boutiques galore and decent cafes (Café Wishbone is good for European coffee). It is easy to spend a few comfortable days here exploring the fortress known as the Ark of Bukhara and craning your neck at the Kalon Minaret (47 metres tall). Don’t miss Shavkat Boltaev’s long-established Bukhara Photo Gallery or Silk Road Spices for tea and sesame brittle. Rumi Hostel is cheap and clean (doubles £18 B\u0026ampB).From Bukhara, make the long journey in a shared taxi to Nukus, the capital of Karakalpakstan, via a necessary connection in Urgench (seven hours, then two more to Nukus, budget around £10 for both). Now’s the time to add in ancient Khiva for more mosques and museums, if you don’t have Silk Road fatigue by now.In Nukus, allow half a day for the incredible Savitsky Museum, which is home to the second-largest collection of Russian avant garde art after St Petersburg’s State Russian Museum. Splurge by staying at the charming Jipek Joli hotel, complete with on-site museum (doubles from £61 B\u0026ampB), then side-trip to the former fishing port of Moynaq, to witness the Aral Sea Crisis and the resultant desolate ship graveyard.Uzbekistan’s rail network is expanding and it has fast trains between tourist cities of Bukhara and Samarkand, with a line to the western city of Khiva almost ready. The slow Soviet trains can be a drag and it’s often better to do as the locals do and take shared taxis: the cheapest, if sometimes slower (and often your only), option. They leave when they fill up. Pay extra for the front seat: more room, plus potentially less motion sickness.Bukhara has the lion’s share of family-run inns with character. My favourite is Kavsar Hotel (doubles from £40, +998 91 406 38 83, no website), with its courtyard and antique-filled rooms. Samarkand’s hotels get booked up by tour groups, especially during the spring festival of Navruz and in the early summer and autumn (peak travel times). Book ahead.Accommodation-wise, an open mind helps in Uzbekistan as the country’s tourism scene is in its infancy and options are limited – especially in Fergana Valley and Karakalpakstan. One night you could be in a Soviet-built monster, the next a basic motel-like inn. Tashkent has some five-star properties but there are few low-cost hotels to pick from.Over-zealous restoration work has blighted much of Uzbekistan’s Timurid-era architecture and, unfortunately, Shahrisabz, south of Samarkand, is a key example. Hasty renovation – and a bid to offer a sanitised version of Uzbek tourism – has destroyed the very thing that made the city special: its medieval townscape, irrecoverably altered forever. Several residential mahallas (neighbourhoods) have been flattened, along with the historic bazaar and in their place is a new plaza.Everyone visits Bukhara’s Jewish quarter but hidden behind Samarkand’s enormous Registan ensemble is a warren of alleys with bread-makers, schools and children running amok, offering a slice of traditional mahalla life. It’s there you’ll find the Gumbaz Synagogue, which was built in 1891. Visitors ought to call ahead first on +998 91 552 7268.Plov is served almost everywhere in Central Asia and Uzbeks are the masters of this layered rice dish that is generally eaten at lunch. At its most simple, plov is rice, onions and carrots usually topped with mutton, lamb or beef. More than just a dish, it represents hospitality, community and identity.Wherever you are, you’ll notice the distinct aroma of carrots, meat and rice that drifts up from bubbling cauldron-like kazans (large cauldrons) in courtyards and kitchens. Lagans (ceramic plates) of plov feed entire families. Eat it at one of the dedicated plov centres in Tashkent and Samarkand.In Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan generally offers the best value with its excellent and affordable homestay network. Oil-rich Kazakhstan, where hotels are often aimed at business people, is pricey, as is tricky Turkmenistan (where, unless you’re on a transit visa, you need a guide outside the capital). Uzbekistan and Tajikistan are on a par but in Tajikistan hiring drivers, for the Pamir Highway, for example, pushes the cost up. Food and beer is generally cheap. A minimum backpacking budget for Uzbekistan is £20-£30pp a day (couples sharing a room can split that cost).From the Fergana Valley, use the Dostyk border between Andijan and Osh for Kyrgyzstan. Osh has an excellent market, pilgrimage sites (Suleiman Too) and decent homestays. From Samarkand, the nearby Penjikent border crossing, into Tajikistan, reopened last year. This border is the gateway to Tajikistan’s Fann Mountains, fantastic for trekking.Two books … Uzbekistan: The Golden Road to Samarkand (Odyssey Illustrated Guides, £16.95) by Calum MacLeod and Bradley Mayhew, the best cultural guide on the market, and The Devils’ Dance (Tilted Axis Press, £9.99) by Hamid Ismailov. Banned in Uzbekistan for 27 years, it grips like a thriller and tells the tale of 19th-century Turkestan, the Great Game and Soviet-era Tashkent.On Instagram, follow @ruztamo who runs local photographic tours, while Caravanistan is an essential resource it’s up-to-date and written by Steven and Saule who know the region.Caroline Eden is author of Black Sea: Dispatches and Recipes – Through Darkness and Light (Hardie Grant Publishing, £25), and co-author, with Eleanor Ford, of Samarkand: Recipes and Stories From Central Asia and the Caucasus (Kyle Books, £25).

At a superficial level it is stunning, violent entertainment, but its study of how the development of apparently intelligent robots could dehumanise their creators makes it a philosophical speculative fiction of the highest order. LostsockUnjustly ended up playing second-fiddle in HBO’s schedule to Game of Thrones, but for me, Boardwalk Empire iswas one of the greatest shows of all time and well worth a binge-watch, truncated fifth season and all. I’d go as far as to say that this and the respective first series of anthology shows Fargo and True Detective have been the last “prestige” television that can hold a candle to programmes like the Sopranos or the Wire. SDSHEPPSeriously, some love for Fargo is needed. Who else cuts from blood, snow and forest to angelic intervention in a bowling alley? Who else provides such sublime soundtracks, subtle characterisation and exquisite photography? Who else details the shift in crime from gangsters to corporate, who discusses the nature of truth and reality, who gives us Obadiah, Camus and Peter and the Wolf? The only TV I have seen that helps find meaning in a disorienting world. CookyhunterThe article left out my vote for one of the best ever: Deadwood. Ian McShane as Al Swearingen gives us the most evil villain since Satan. The rest of the cast is peppered with expertly played misfits, perverts, eccentrics and even decent people. The language is over the top, but you get used to it. Marty WolfA fantastic multilayered French police and justice system drama. Combining soap-like story arcs with political intrigue, comedy, psychodrama and cliffhangers, it cast a forensic eye over the French system of law and politics and class and race and sex and morality. Brilliant. scausmausFor science fiction fans, add the reboot of Battlestar Galactica. It holds up pretty well on rewatching, although you can see the strain between Ron Moore and Sci-Fi Channel, as it was then, all the more with the passage of time, from the weak “standalone” episodes in season three (Sci-Fi wanted more of those) to the rushed last season (it was supposed to run five seasons, but Sci-Fi would only commit to one more after series three, so Moore cut parts out.) Craig DeBlockMy absolute favourite. Yes, a few poor episodes and sub-plots, but all in all it was brilliant. Coming from a North American evangelical childhood (I’m now humanist) made it all the more enthralling. Bill Paxton, Chloë Sevigny, Jeanne Tripplehorn and so many more great performances. ID0286463Buffy should be in there, especially as unlike many listed here it gets better as it goes on. Tough it through series one, and series two onwards will delight you. manetrancedMy favourite ever TV series is Heimat, set mainly in a German village close to the French border. The first two series take in from the end of the first world war to the late 60s. The third series covered reunification and is not quite so good although still wonderful. It is on Netflix. EclecticalBrilliant throughout and can thoroughly recommend. Great character development, insanely funny at times and a loving and well researched look at historical themes, memes and fashions from 60s and 70s America. Very entertaining stuff. EllieArrowayWhere on earth is the Shield on this list? Characters, plots, subplots and twists on a Shakespearean level, with the quality of the likes of Glenn Close and Forest Whitaker coming in to add further lustre to a cast that was on point the whole way through. Glorious. gmancThe American version of The Office is just so much better than the original: I can’t believe it didn’t get a mention. Yes, Ricky Gervais came up with the original concept, but Steve Carrell knocked the socks off him with depth of character and humour. After a couple of episodes of the original you just want to punch David Brent quite hard and turn it off. Addie21I came across this late last year and watched it to the end of season three in only a few days, despite an effort to slow down and extend the pleasure.

It’s a remarkable statistic given that the majority of those surveyed would not have even been born when the series ended in 2004.So just what is it about the lives of twenty-somethings in 90s Manhattan that chimes so much with today’s teenagers? We’d love to hear from readers under the age of 18 about why the sitcom resonates with them, as well as their favourite characters and episodes. We’d also love to know which aspects of the series feel particularly dated or even problematic in 2019.If you’re 16 or over please share your Friends views and reviews in the form below.

But readers can learn a lot from what she doesn’t sayHollywood stars never tell you what they’re actually allowed to eat, and political memoirs never tell you how a politician actually got elected.Senator Kamala Harris’s new autobiography, released just before she announced her presidential campaign, reveals very little about the California senator’s fascinating, historic rise in Democratic politics. Campaign memoirs are not a literary exercise: they’re an excuse for a speaking tour. Like most examples of the genre, The Truths We Hold: An American Journey is a mix of copy-pasted policy papers and “relatable” personal anecdotes. Harris repeats, sometimes nearly word for word, many of the stories she has shared in speeches and interviews.Still, hidden between the recaps of recent crises, there’s a surprisingly clear portrait of a candidate wary of the cost of sharing too much about herself.When Harris decided to become a prosecutor in the Oakland district attorney’s office, she had defend her choice to “incredulous” friends and family. She was raised in Berkeley at the height of the civil rights movement and had been taken to protests in her stroller. (Once, when she was upset as a toddler, her mother asked her what she wanted. “Fweedom!” tiny Kamala yelled back.)Harris writes that she has often faced questions about “how I, as a black woman, could countenance being part of ‘the machine’ putting more young men of color behind bars”.“I knew part of making change was what I’d seen all my life, surrounded by adults shouting and marching and demanding justice from the outside,” Harris writes. “But I also knew there was an important role on the inside, sitting at the table where decisions were being made. When activists came marching and banging on the doors, I wanted to be on the other side to let them in.”The “regal” superior courthouse in Oakland, which looks like “an art deco wedding cake”. “The “gray, solemn and imposing” Hall of Justice in San Francisco. The “magnificence” of the supreme court in Washington. Harris is at her most effusive when she describes government buildings, particularly court houses. “These are buildings that speak,” she writes, explaining her habit of visiting high court buildings whenever she tours foreign countries.Harris writes about bureaucratic dysfunction. One of the offices where she worked as a young lawyer had a culture of backstabbing so intense that attorneys were afraid to attend good-bye parties for their fired colleagues. Later, Harris was elected to run that office, and she recounts proudly how she worked to change the office culture, starting with repainting and installing photocopiers that actually worked. “I’ve always believed there is no problem too small to fix,” she writes.There are real personal details in the first, carefully sketched chapter about Harris’ childhood in Berkeley: her neighbors and caretakers, her mother’s cooking, her trips to visit her mother’s family in India and her father’s family in Jamaica. (Sorry, Canadians: Montreal, where she and her mother and sister moved when she was 12, gets a scant six paragraphs.)But the few personal details of Harris’ adult life feel forced. The book opens, with artificial intimacy, with Harris waking up in bed. Her love of Doritos, already mobilized as an acceptable quirk, makes another appearance.As she watched the 2016 election returns and realized Trump was going to win, Harris, who had just been elected to the Senate, ate an entire “family-size” bag of Doritos by herself. “Didn’t share a single chip,” she writes.Harris dated the former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown for a year, when he was 60 and she was 29. Harris is only one of Brown’s political proteges, who include California’s governor and San Francisco’s mayor, who once babysat Brown’s children. Her memoir does not mention Brown’s name.More surprising is how little Harris shares about her adult relationship with her younger sister, Maya Harris, a former top adviser to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and now the chair of Harris’ 2020 campaign. Maya, a veteran of influential progressive groups, and her husband, Tony West, the third-ranking official in Obama’s justice department, are often mentioned, but never quite in focus, as if each time the camera turns toward them, they move to the edge of the frame.The work of a political memoir, see-sawing between impressive achievements and “but I’m just like you” details, seems to leave no space for the story of how two brilliant sisters, the daughters of immigrants from India and Jamaica, made their family into a Democratic political force. It would be interesting, for example, to hear how the family handled the moment when both Harris and her brother-in-law were presumed to be on the list of potential replacements for Eric Holder, Obama’s attorney general, in 2014. Harris writes with zeal when she describes settlement negotiations with bank executives over the role the institutions played in the foreclosure crisis.Harris, then attorney general of California, explains how the negotiations unfolded and what it took for her to be able to pull California out of them altogether. Instead of broadly describing needy Americans, she gives sharp portraits of her opponents and the one-liners she landed at conference tables. (Her staff, she writes later, jokes that “Kamala” means “get more commas in that settlement price”.)Harris will continue to face scrutiny over whether she was tough enough on bank executives, including Steve Mnunchin, now Trump’s treasury secretary. But her description of the foreclosure fight offers a hint of a broader critique, perhaps to come, of just how unprepared bank executives were to face any kind of real accountability from the government.“You represent the people,” Harris tells young lawyers. “So I expect you to know exactly who the people are.”But in the stories Harris tells about her career, the people she has helped are often faceless and nameless. She describes her feelings on the first day she went to trial on her own, but says nothing about her client. Her fight to make sure that a young mother swept up in a drug raid did not have to spend the weekend in jail was “a defining moment in my life”, Harris writes, but she notes that she never actually met the mother.Harris writes with warmth about friends and allies, and seems proud to be part of a cohort of women who helped each other rise. She is not above a few well-placed jabs at the men who underestimated her. (“I hope you know how big a job this is going to be,” she describes her Republican opponent telling her, as he concedes the race for California attorney general.)But in writing about the Americans who need politicians’ help, Harris often slips into vague cliches: grieving mothers, anxious fathers.Harris married Doug Emhoff, an entertainment lawyer from Los Angeles, in 2014. His Twitter feed portrays him as his wife’s biggest fan and a proud father. (He has two children from a previous marriage.)The glimpses Harris gives us of her husband are sweet and goofy: wearing goggles to chop onions in the kitchen (“Let me tell you, there’s nothing more attractive than a man in onion goggles”), or being so excited to propose to her that he can’t wait until their romantic trip to Italy. Instead, he takes out the ring as she’s distracted and trying to pack the night before their flight. In an early joint media interview, after Harris dodges a question about who would play her in a movie, Emhoff says he’d be “delighted” to be played by Bradley Cooper.When they first started dating, Harris was the attorney general of California, and Emhoff appeared to take her busy schedule very seriously.“The morning after our first date, Doug emailed me with all of his available dates for the next couple of months. ‘I’m too old to play games or hide the ball,’ the e-mail read. ‘I really like you, and I want to see if we can make this work.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82f47fa58c3db9da22e57e2b040667364a4c995f/0_144_4000_2398/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=226ffa7941165e2cc9873f7b68f0f25a","title":"polar vortex us weather latest temperatures midwest east","story":"Great Lakes may dip to -40F amid bitter cold carried by the polar vortex, a stream of air that spins around over the North PoleParts of the United States braced for record low temperatures Wednesday, as a blast of Arctic air known as the polar vortex grips much of the country and spreads further across the Midwest and eastern states.Temperatures could hit -40F (-40C) in parts of the Northern Plains and Great Lakes, the National Weather Service said.As of Wednesday morning, Chicago was already significantly colder than Antarctica, with the city at -21F and the south pole at -11F. With the wind chill factor, low temperatures Los Angeles would feel about 100F warmer than Chicago on Wednesday.“The heart of this cold ... is hitting us now. A lot of records are going to fall,” said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the NWS’s Weather Prediction Center in Maryland.Officials in Illinois and the Northern states are advising residents to stay indoors, as Chicago braced for one of its coldest days on record.In many cities, concern is especially acute for homeless people who may have nowhere to stay. Advocates said there are rarely enough shelter beds for all homeless people, and some homeless may avoid sleeping in shelters. “I’m cold and I’m afraid,” homeless Chicago resident Tony Neeley told the New York Times, as the cold bared down. Many cities have also opened warming shelters in churches, government buildings and inside high schools, charities, fearing especially for homeless people could be caught outside. Almost 2,000 flights were canceled early Wednesday, largely out of Chicago O’Hare and Chicago Midway international airports, according to the flight tracking site FlightAware.Amtrak said it had canceled all trains in and out of the city, where Hurley forecast -15F on Wednesday and a record-low -27F on Thursday. In New York, interstates are closed to trucks for fear of invisible “black ice”. Government offices are closed in New Jersey as the western part of the state. The bitter cold is being carried by the polar vortex, an area of low pressure which spins counterclockwise in the stratospheres over the north and south poles. The current of this low pressure area has been disrupted and is now pushing south.The polar vortex is not new. Scientists believe it first appeared in 1853, in an issue of a popular magazine which gathered articles from British and American newspapers. Including the wind chill factor, parts of the Dakotas, Wisconsin and Minnesota could see life-threatening temperatures as low as 70F below zero on Wednesday, forecasters said.Dashcam footage from one trucker taken outside Grand Rapids, Michigan gave a snapshot of hair-raising driving conditions.“I about just got caught in a giant wreck cars are into other pickups, there’s people hurt. I gotta let you go,” Jason Coffelt is heard saying in an Instagram posting dated Tuesday, as his truck is forced off the highway and pulls up just before a multi-vehicle accident.In Buffalo, New York, intense cold and snow storms combined Tuesday evening to produce whiteout conditions. However, as many stay home through the worst of the weather, some Americans are taking the cold in stride. With little to do, one Wisconsin woman filled balloons with water and food coloring on her porch railing, making icy colored orbs. Others shared pictures of their pet’s multi-layered winter outfits, and reminded people to bring pets inside.

His condition is not thought to be immediately life-threatening, but is serious and developed abruptly. On Tuesday Parrella was issuing rulings on the next day’s hearings.He had shown no outward signs of ill health, but at 7pm on Tuesday evening he summoned defence and prosecution lawyers and informed them he was being flown out of the US military base in south-east Cuba back to the mainland for urgent medical treatment.The Office of Military Commissions issued a brief statement saying: “Due to a medical issue impacting the military judge’s ability to work, the rest of the session is cancelled.”Parrella was made judge in the 911 case last August, taking control of a case that has been dogged by false starts, procedural delays and controversy over the military commissions themselves. The defendants, accused of having orchestrated the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon killing nearly 3,000 people, were first charged in 2008. But the case is still in its preliminary phase, with a trial not expected to begin before 2020 at the earliest.Much of the contention is testimony from the defendants obtained after long periods of torture in CIA “black sites” before they were flown to Guantánamo.Parrella’s fitness to try the case is being challenged in federal court by defence lawyers for failing to disclose the extent of prior relationships with members of the prosecution team.On Monday one of the defendants, Ramzi bin al-Shibh – a Yemeni accused of arranging for some of the hijackers to go to flight school in the US and helping finance the operation – challenged Parrella’s authority to preside over the court.The defendant had raised a similar objection before, but on this occasion Parrella appeared rattled by the challenge and said his attitude “could potentially put everyone in this room’s safety in jeopardy” – a claim that surprised defence lawyers, who interpreted it as a threat to shackle the prisoner.On the same day, defence lawyers threatened to boycott proceedings over what they said was aggressive FBI questioning of a legal assistant who had left Guantánamo in December.On Tuesday, Parrella heard opposing arguments over whether the testimony of a former defence interpreter could be heard in open court. Defendants had claimed they had seen the interpreter at a “black site” and it was confirmed he had worked for the CIA. Defence lawyers have been seeking to question him on whether he had been CIA infiltrator. Parrella ruled that the hearing would have to be held behind closed doors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae477c21d9b505d51bcacf67a9551485d78d8cca/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92b4a54809499d9ef21a37ea74bd2a2f","title":"ireland nurses and midwives first day strikes pay no deal brexit","story":"PM rejects demands, saying money needed to mitigate the effects of a no-deal Brexit Tens of thousands of nurses and midwives have gone on strike in Ireland for better pay and conditions but the government has rebuffed their demands, saying it needs to save funds for a possible no-deal Brexit.More than 35,000 walked out on Wednesday morning and in near-freezing temperatures mounted pickets at clinics and hospitals, causing the cancellation of services for about 25,000 patients.The 24-hour strike by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) is the first of six days of industrial action planned for the next two weeks.The union called its first national strike in two decades after talks with the government and the Health Service Executive, a state agency, broke down.The INMO says nurses and midwives work longer hours and are paid less money than in 2008, when the global financial crisis prompted austerity measures.“No nurse or midwife wants to go on strike, but we have been forced into this position by a government that just isn’t listening,” said Tony Fitzpatrick, its industrial relations director.The government says nurses are to receive significant pay rises under an existing public service agreement and that the additional rise they are striking for would cost about €300m (£260m) a year, blowing a hole in the budget and triggering demands for hefty rises from other public sector workers.The prime minister, Leo Varadkar, told the Dáil on Tuesday that fiscal responsibility was all the more urgent because of the increased probability of the UK crash out of the EU without a deal on 29 March.“I have to be a taoiseach for the whole country,” he said. “We will have to find a lot of money to save people’s jobs.”Earlier on Tuesday, the Department of Finance said a no-deal Brexit would slash growth in Ireland and cost potential 55,000 jobs by 2023.Varadkar rejected opposition accusations that he was using Brexit as a stick to beat nurses and midwives. “This isn’t made up – and it’s not about blaming anyone,” he said. The only one to blame for Brexit was Britain, he said.The state’s health budget – and credibility – is already reeling from the cost of a new national children’s hospital in Dublin, which is scheduled to open in 2022. Budgeted in 2016 at €983m, the cost has ballooned to €1.4bn and may exceed €1.7bn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27dbe78eea2622ee4abb1913af474670a866c1f4/0_56_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af9297f77f18643cd958af438ef48297","title":"matteo salvini makes u turn prospect facing kidnapping trial","story":"Far-right minister initially welcomed potential case but now says it should not happenMatteo Salvini, Italy’s far-right interior minister, has asked his government to deny prosecutors the right to try him on potential kidnapping charges over his order to prevent 177 people from disembarking a migrant boat.The move is a stark reversal from Salvini’s previous position that he was ready to be tried and proud of “having defended the country from illegal migrants”.In August, prosecutors in Agrigento, Sicily, placed Salvini under investigation after he prevented people from leaving the Italian coastguard ship Ubaldo Diciotti. The ship had been docked for six days at the Sicilian port of Catania as Salvini maintained a standoff with the EU in an attempt to push other member states to take in its mostly Eritrean passengers. The Catholic church, Ireland and Albania, which is not an EU state, eventually agreed to host the migrants.But thebreakthrough did not stop the investigation into Salvini and the minister is a step away from facing court after a surprise ruling last week determined that he be tried. “I could face up to 15 years of jail because I have stopped the disembarking of illegals in Italy,” Salvini wrote on Facebook. “I’m speechless. Am I afraid? Not at all.”Nevertheless, in a letter to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera published on Tuesday, Salvini, the leader of the far-right League party, said he was no longer sure he was ready to face a trial.“After reflecting on the whole affair, I believe the authorisation to try me must be denied,” he wrote. “My judicial case is closely linked to my activities as interior minister and my strong will to keep the commitments made in the election campaign. I’m convinced that I acted in the supreme interest of the country and within the full respect of my mandate.“I would do it all again. And I won’t give up,” he wrote, but added: “The judges should be denied authorisation.”The investigation against Salvini poses a political risk to Italy’s governing coalition as well as a personal risk to his criminal record. The accusations against him will now pass now through the senate, where its members will decide whether to proceed with a trial or halt the proceedings altogether. One of the founding principles of the League’s coalition partner, the Five Star Movement, is that politicians under investigation should be asked to resign.Until two years ago, this principle was written into M5S’s statutes as part of an attempt to present a clean image and distance itself from corruption in Italian politics. On the one hand, should M5S senators vote against criminal proceedings, thereby rescuing Salvini from a possible conviction, the party would lose credibility among its supporters. On the other, if it supports the investigation against Salvini, then it risks losing him and the political alliance, causing the government to fall.On Wednesday a senate commission will meet to begin examining the papers of the investigation into Salvini. The vote on whether to proceed is expected in late February.Since last Friday Salvini has denied another recue boat, Sea-Watch 3, the right to disembark its passengers in Sicily. It has 47 people on board, and has been docked in front of the port of Syracuse.After negotiations, five countries – Germany, France, Portugal, Romania and Malta – have agreed to distribute the asylum seekers onboard among themselves, raising hopes that the Italian government will authorise their disembarkation soon."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3776079.1548858266!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"peace more important than economics says coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney addresses a meeting of the Institute of International and European Affairs at the Gresham hotel in Dublin. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WirePeace in Ireland is more important than relationships that could affect economic growth, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said.He also warned the British government that Ireland will not be the “casualty” of isions in the UK Conservative party.Mr Coveney warned the Tories against a strategy that may be “about keeping a party together that for 30 years has been torn apart” by the UK’s relationship with Europe. “If that what this is about, I cannot allow that agenda make Ireland the casualty of,”he said.In a speech in Dublin on Wednesday, Mr Coveney criticised the decision of British prime minister Theresa May to support a vote in the House of Commons calling for the backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard border after Brexit, to be replaced.The Tánaiste mounted a strong defence of the backstop, which would see the UK remain in a common customs area with the EU, with add ons in terms of customs and regulations for Northern Ireland to keep the Irish border open, if there is no future trade deal between the EU and the UK.Mr Coveney said the backstop and issues relating to the peace process were difficult to deal with during Brexit negotiations and took a long time to reach a compromise on.“That is why the backstop, and the peace process and the border issues…have been so difficult to deal with and took so long to get compromises on.”On peace, Mr Coveney told a meeting of the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) in the Gresham Hotel: “There are some things that are more important than economic relationships, and this is one of them.”Mrs May has said she will return to Brussels to seek changes to the backstop, the element of the Brexit withdrawal agreement that is the main stumbling block to the deal passing Westminster.The motion she backed in a House of Commons vote on Tuesday, and which won a majority in the house, called for the backstop to be replaced by unspecified alternative arrangements. Mr Coveney said a legally operable backstop cannot be given up for hopes that the border can be kept open by some other method.“These hopes have already been tested in negotiations and have come up short,” he said. He said the vote in the Commons “signals a turning point of a British prime minister on this issue” and said that is why it has had “such an impact here” and in Northern Ireland.He called on the UK to listen to all political parties in Northern Ireland and not just Mrs May’s confidence and supply partners in the DUP, saying it is “all the more critical”.Mr Coveney said he has been equally critical of Sinn Féin’s call for a referendum on Irish unity to take place as a result of Brexit."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3661517.1539356993!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit explained why does the border matter and what is the backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A defaced ‘Welcome to Northern Ireland’ sign is displayed on the Border in Derry. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyWhy is the Irish Border such a big deal with Brexit? The 499-kilometre border running from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle will become the only land border between the UK and the European Union after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement brought peace to Northern Ireland and removed the need for border checks.It also established North-South rules and institutions that helped solidify the Peace Process. The border is currently invisible and neither side wants the return of infrastructure along the border or the creation of a hard border.So what exactly is a hard border? It is a frontier monitored and protected by customs officials and border inspectors, and potentially police or military personnel if there are security issues around the border.That could in turn lead to a police or military presence along the Border to protect check points. Customs and security posts along the Border were regular targets of republican paramilitaries during the 30-year Troubles.Why would there be a need for border checks? Different customs rules, regulations and standards will apply in Northern Ireland and the Republic if the UK is leaving the EU so the different rules could have to be enforced at a border.What do the EU and UK want along the Border? Neither party to the Brexit negotiations wants to see the return of a hard border but they cannot agree a plan on how to achieve this.So have they come up with anything to solve this problem? The EU and UK agreed in a political deal in December 2017 that a “backstop” was required in the withdrawal agreement – the orce deal – that would guarantee an invisible border in the event of no other solution to achieve this being found in a Brexit deal, either in a specific solution for Northern Ireland or in a broader EU-UK trade deal.The December 2017 agreement also aims to protect North-South co-operation, support the all-island economy and safeguards the 1998 Belfast Agreement. In March 2018 the two sides agreed that there had to be a legal text – not just a political declaration – around how this option would work in practice should no better option be found.What exactly is the backstop? It is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland.It would only be used as a last resort or the default option if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic.How have the backstop talks developed? Brussels believed a hard border could be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remains fully aligned with the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market after Brexit.This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries,.Northern Ireland would stick to EU rules covering state aid and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules. The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier initially insisted that this backstop can only apply to Northern Ireland.London argued that if the backstop only applies to Northern Ireland, it would effectively create a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. The Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which keeps May’s minority Conservative government in power,\u0026nbspalso objected. They oppose any checks between Ireland and Britain and what they see as a border in the Irish Sea.So what finally appeared in the withdrawal agreement on the backstop? The UK government suggested a backstop that would keep the whole of the UK aligned with EU customs union \u0026nbspafter the post-Brexit transition period.\u0026nbsp The transition is\u0026nbspa standstill period when current EU economic rules continue to apply over the UK. Under the agreement it is due to\u0026nbspexpire\u0026nbspat the end of 2020 but it could be extended to 2022.\u0026nbspThe backstop would be triggered if the two sides\u0026nbspfail to agree\u0026nbspa new trade deal by that time\u0026nbspthat is far-reaching enough to avoid Irish border checks. Under the backstop, the North would also follow EU regulatory rules set down by the single market for goods. This would be enough to avoid a hard Irish Border, but would still involve some regulatory checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.But there are still problems?Yes, while the UK government signed off on the withdrawal agreement, Theresa May faced fierce opposition to it in the House of Commons and the backstop was one of the reasons why the House of Commons rejected the withdrawal agreement by 230 votes on January 15th, inflicting the heaviest parliamentary defeat ever on a British government. Many Conservatives fear that once the backstop is triggered, there will be no way out of it for the UK. The DUP objects to the fact that regulatory checks would be needed on goods crossing from Britain to the North and that the North would have to follow some rules set down in Brussels.\u0026nbspIs there a way around this? It is difficult. The EU has\u0026nbspgiven the UK assurances that it will make every effort to negotiate a new trade deal to make the backstop unnecessary, or – if it is introduced – to ensure that it is in force for as short a time as possible. However, crucially, the EU insists that the withdrawal agreement itself must remain untouched. This says that the backstop remains in place “unless and until” another way is found to avoid a hard Irish Border.\u0026nbspMany Conservative MPs and the DUP are not satisfied by non-binding assurances, fearing that the legal withdrawal agreement is the key document.\u0026nbspWhat if\u0026nbspthere is no agreement?If there is no backstop, there will be no orce deal and no transition period. In other words, there would be a disorderly Brexit and the UK would crash out of the EU in March 2019. It is anyone’s guess how goods passing over the Irish Border would be treated in such a scenario but the UK’s chaotic departure from the EU could create all sorts of difficulties for cross-border trade and beyond. It is also \u0026nbspopen to the UK to ask for an extension of the article 50 process – its departure date. The other 27 EU members would all have to agree. So far Theresa May has said she will not do this. She has also set her face against a second referendum vote.

Photograph:  UK ParliamentJessica TaylorPA WireBritain is exploring alternative options to the Irish backstop within the Withdrawal Agreement, after parliament voted to order Theresa May to renegotiate the terms, Brexit minister Stephen Barclay said.MPs voted on Tuesday to support the prime minister’s Brexit deal if she secures changes from Brussels to the Northern Ireland backstop - an insurance policy written into the Withdrawal Agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland.At the end of a dramatic day at Westminster, MPs endorsed the proposal by 317 votes to 301, a majority of 16.The DUP’s 10 MPs joined Conservative Brexiteers to support the amendment after Mrs May said she would seek to reopen the text of the agreement. It was a striking reversal of fortune for Mrs May, who saw her Brexit deal rejected by 230 votes two weeks ago.“The dynamic did change last night and it gives a clear mandate to the prime minister to take back to Brussels,” Mr Barclay told BBC radio on Wednesday. He claimed that Tuesday night’s amendments, two weeks after Mrs May suffered the heaviest parliamentary defeat in modern history over the meaningful vote, had “overturned a defeat of 230 into a victory”.Asked repeatedly what could replace the backstop in the deal he said: “There are a number of options, there are issues in terms of having time limits, issues in terms of exit clauses, issues in terms of technology and this will be the nature of the negotiation with the EU in the coming days.” He said the UK was “exploring in terms of the use of technology... looking at things like the time limit” to deal with the backstop.“There are a number of options, there are issues in terms of having time limits, issues in terms of exit clauses, issues in terms of technology and this will be the nature of the negotiation with the European Union in the coming days.” However, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said Brexit negotiators have spent two years looking at alternatives to the backstop and not found any that work.“We have been through all of these things. We have tested them and we have found that they do not stand up to scrutiny, and now we have a British prime minister advocating again for the same things that were tested,” Mr Coveney told RTÉ Radio. Mrs May will meet Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn later on Wednesday to discuss Brexit. The meeting comes two weeks after Mr Corbyn rejected the prime minister’s invitations on the grounds that she should first rule out a no-deal Brexit.Mrs May is also due to speak to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar by telephone on Wednesday. Mr Corbyn told the House of Commons he would meet Mrs May because “parliament has voted to remove the immediate threat of crashing out without a deal on 29 March”. The decision to hold the meeting follows internal pressure upon Labour’s leader from some of his closest aides.One senior party source said: “If we want to avoid a no-deal Brexit, there has to be some level of negotiations between the parties. We have to be involved.”At the meeting, a Labour source said that confirming rejection of a no deal will remain a key issue. “Jeremy will insist that the will of parliament is respected and that no deal is now off the table,” he said. Mr Corbyn will also press Labour’s Brexit plan, which envisages a customs union, a strong single-market relationship and a guarantee on workers’ rights, consumer standards and environmental protections. “That now must be the focus for negotiations,” the source said. Two weeks ago, Mrs May wrote to Mr Corbyn urging him to take part in meetings with her and other ministers following the rejection of her negotiated deal on the withdrawal bill. Mr Corbyn dismissed the invitation as a stunt. In a speech in Hastings, he said: “With no deal on the table, the prime minister will enter into phoney talks just to run down the clock and try to blackmail MPs to vote through her botched deal on a second attempt by threatening the country with the chaos that no-deal would bring.” They last met to discuss the Brexit process in November.On Tuesday night, Mrs May said she would go back to Brussels. “We will now take this mandate forward and seek to obtain legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement that deal with concerns on the backstop while guaranteeing no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. My colleagues and I will talk to the EU about how we address the House’s views,” she said.“There is limited appetite for such a change in the EU and negotiating it will not be easy. But in contrast to a fortnight ago, this House has made it clear what it needs to approve a withdrawal agreement.”In a further boost for the PM, MPs rejected an amendment that could have postponed Brexit rather than leaving the EU without a deal. They backed another amendment that rejected a no-deal Brexit without prescribing any action to prevent it.In Dublin, the Government issued a terse statement: “The EU position on the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, is set out in the conclusions of the December meeting of the European Council. It has not changed.”It said that the administration would “continue our preparations for all outcomes, including for a no-deal scenario.”European Council President Donald Tusk said the withdrawal agreement “remains the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal”. In a statement issued on his behalf, he said: “The backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement, and the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation.”Mr Tusk and Mrs May will have a phone call about Brexit on Wednesday evening, his press office said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

But the vote in favour of Graham Brady’s amendment has changed a great deal, uniting the Conservative party over Brexit and identifying the Northern Ireland backstop as the sole obstacle in the way of ratifying the withdrawal agreement.A day earlier, the prime minister’s insistence on seeking a majority for her Brexit deal on the basis of Conservative and DUP votes appeared doomed. And a cross-party majority opposed to a no-deal Brexit seemed poised to assert itself by taking control of the parliamentary agenda so that MPs could force the government to seek an extension to the article 50 negotiating deadline.Yvette Cooper’s amendment to allow such a course of action was the most dangerous for the prime minister, not least because it encouraged the view in EU capitals a majority could be found for a softer Brexit. But May told MPs if she had not completed the renegotiation of her deal by February 13th, she would introduce an amendable motion that would be debated the following day.This persuaded enough Conservative waverers that they would have another opportunity to block a no-deal Brexit. And Labour MPs who were queasy about being seen to be thwarting Brexit were able to comfort themselves by voting for another amendment which rejected a no-deal Brexit but did nothing to stop it.The isolation of a change to the backstop as the single issue that is both necessary and sufficient to unlock a majority for the withdrawal agreement will shape the next stage of negotiations between London and Brussels. Although Tusk’s statement last night reflected the current consensus among EU leaders, the mood could change as pressure to resolve the backstop issue grows.To win any concessions, May must first formulate a precise demand by identifying the “alternative measures” she wants to replace the backstop. The so-called Malthouse compromise that united some of her Remainer and Brexiteer backbenchers could become a burden to her negotiating team of Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, attorney general Geoffrey Cox and her effective deputy prime minister David Lidington. The Malthouse proposals are too outlandish and impractical to form the basis of any solution to the backstop. So as the prime minister seeks to woo her European partners, she will also have to keep a close eye on her ever watchful Brexiteer backbencher as she lets them down gently.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

They love Champagne,” said Mr Taittinger, 65, an unabashed anglophile.Like all great mistakes, it led to a great invention.”Mr Taittinger added: “As the English have a little ‘crazy’ side, they invented the whole thing, the playful side… They invented the consumption of champagne, as well as clarets from Bordeaux, Burgundy, cognac, in short, everything that’s made the reputation of France in the world.”According to popular belief, sparkling Champagne was invented by a monk, Dom Pierre Pérignon, in the 17th century. In fact, he helped to develop still wines from the Champagne region. It was an English physician, Christopher Merret, who first described the process of adding sugar to a wine to carbonate it by creating a second fermentation.He documented what is now known as the “méthode champenoise” in a scientific paper in 1662, although he did not claim to have invented it. Fizzy white wine only became the distinctive wine of the Champagne region much later, in the 19th century.The first sparkling champagne is believed to have been created accidentally.The high pressure in bottles of champagne wine often caused them to explode, or the corks to pop, which led to it being dubbed “the devil’s wine”.Initially, the presence of bubbles was seen as a mistake, but drinkers gradually came to appreciate them. The “muselet”, the wire cage to prevent the cork from popping, was invented in the 19th century.Please review our commenting policyWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?Emiliano Sala missing plane: Two seat cushions found on French beachValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: Why Cupid and the heart are associated with loveFilmmaker Sir Peter Jackson announces new documentary on the Beatles Chinese New Year 2019: Pigs, luck and why you should avoid medicine, laundry and crying childrenBrexit latest news: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn in the Commons ahead of their meetingDuchess of Sussex returns to acting roots as she visits National Theatre for first time as patronTheresa May hails SNP government figures showing Scottish exports to UK more than three times EU level\u0026#39Wholeheartedly ashamed and disgusted with our MPs tonight\u0026#39 -  readers on what next for Brexit Italy says five countries have agreed to take migrants stranded on rescue boat off SicilyRussia claims no knowledge of plane sent to Venezuela \u0026#39to extract 20 tonnes of gold\u0026#39 from national bankComment: Six reasons why Theresa May\u0026#39s gambit might just workBrexit latest odds: Best bets on how (and if) Brexit will happenSunderland AFC staff member, 60, arrested on suspicion of meeting boy \u0026#39following sexual grooming\u0026#39Survey reveals toll of sexual harassment faced by young womenAmericans warned not to go outside as polar vortex grips Midwest with record low temperaturesHow the EU reacted to MPs\u0026#39 rejection of the Irish backstopWhat next for the Brexit deal and Theresa May’s Withdrawal agreement?What next for the Brexit deal?

He told The Independent that a customer based in the Republic of Ireland had already stopped working with his firm “because they are scared about what will happen after Brexit”.“We have customers asking us about what we are going to do and about our supply chains. It’s really, really difficult,” he said. “It’s the uncertainty more than anything. Business does not like uncertainty and it’s creating havoc with us.”Trading partners across Europe are nervous about the future, and investment at a standstill because of the uncertainty. “We are holding back and keeping our cash because we many need it to get over the next few years,” the businessman said. “It’s created a real issue for us going forward. We just don’t know what’s going to happen and we won’t be investing until we know what’s going to happen and until we know what happens with the customs union.“If we get into the position where we can’t trade freely across the border our competitors in the rest of Europe will jump on that and take that trade away from us.”He pointed out that if a deal is reached, there will still be two years of negotiations to get through.\u0026nbspThe alternative – a no-deal Brexit – is even more daunting. “If we go into WTO rules, that’s going to create serious issues,” he said. “Within Northern Ireland we will have a struggling economy in the UK on one side, the Republic of Ireland is going to have issues, and we will be left in the middle trying to trade. It’s a no-win situation.” Meanwhile, firms feel like they have been somewhat abandoned by the UK government. Mr Kelly said that the government’s advice to business in Northern Ireland was essentially “not to do anything”. “It’s 58 days to go – there’s food on the shelves that has a longer shelf life than that,” he added. “The Irish government has been working with industries for the past two years. We have nothing, we’ve have been left hung out, hoping for the best. It’s unacceptable.”The business owner told The Independent that communication from Westminster had been “very, very lacking”. “The whole thing has been handled particularly badly,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We are in limbo, paddling away. We aren’t growing but we haven’t contracted, so that’s something – but that could change very quickly. It’s a nightmare.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And what precisely does it entail for the UK?What is the World Trade Organisation?It is an inter-governmental organisation with 164 members – almost every state in the world and certainly all the major economies.Its central purpose is to permit goods and services\u0026nbspto flow across borders with relative ease.The key element of its agreements is that every member shall treat every other member equally in terms of tariff charges, meaning there shall be no arbitrary discrimination.So if country X, say, offers a lower tariff on a certain imported product to country Y it also has to automatically offer that lower tariff to every other country too. This is the “most favoured nation” principle.However, there is an exception. Where two countries enter into a free trade agreement that covers the bulk of their trade, they can offer each other lower tariffs without having to also offer them to everyone else.So the countries of the EU free trade area can charge zero tariffs on cars imported from each other but can keep the levies in place on cars imported from America.Another function of the WTO is to arbitrate disputes. So if one country accuses another of breaking the rules of the system the WTO will examine the case and decide which party is in the right.The party that is in the wrong will face sanctions and the party that is in the right is allowed to impose import restrictions.If we leave the EU would we be able to trade on WTO rules with the rest of the world?Yes. The UK is already an independent member of the WTO.To trade in its own right (outside the European Union’s customs union) we would first need to notify the rest of the membership about our proposed tariffs and quotas. Other countries in the WTO could then raise objections to these – and indeed have already done so. But this is a pretty minor obstacle.A far more important problem is that many aspects of our economic\u0026nbsprelations would not be underpinned by WTO rules.The WTO framework doesn’t cover extremely important aspects of a modern economy like the UK such as aviation, medicine export licencing, data flow and many other areas.The UK would also, incidentally, fall out of the coverage of all the free trade agreements between the EU and states such as Mexico and South Korea.This is the reason why it is misleading to talk about a “WTO deal”. The WTO is a patchy, minimum framework not any kind of substitute for a comprehensive free trade agreement such as we have had with the EU.But doesn’t most of the world trade perfectly happily on basic WTO rules?No. This is a fallacy. Even if countries are not in comprehensive free trade agreements, almost all have bilateral agreements with other states on top of their WTO relationship.Do the WTO rules say that if we agree with the EU to pursue a free trade deal we can keep tariffs at zero until it’s ready?Another fallacy. This claim seems to be a reference to Article XXIV of the WTO rules.But trade experts say this covers the circumstances of two countries forming a new trade agreement, not of them leaving one. And they insist that those who cite it as a reason why nothing has to change on trade after Brexit are labouring under a gross\u0026nbspmisunderstanding\u0026nbspof the rule.“The idea that Article XXIV...somehow obliges the EU to continue providing the full benefits of the single market for the next ten years, or even allows the UK to unilaterally offer the EU (and no one else) market access is preposterous,” says\u0026nbspDmitry Grozoubinski, a former Australian trade negotiator.In any case the overriding concern of industry resulting from a no-deal Brexit is not actually tariffs but the negative impact of border checks resulting from leaving the EU’s customs union and single market.Do WTO rules compel the EU not to impose trade frictions on the UK?Yet another fallacy. Some have argued that the WTO “commits members to facilitate trade”, implying the EU would be breaking the law if it imposed\u0026nbspany new border restrictions or tariffs after a no-deal Brexit, including on the Irish border.But analysts say that, however onerous they are, tariffs and border checks are perfectly compatible with this WTO “facilitate trade” requirement.“Both the UK and the EU already comply with this agreement, meaning any procedures they introduce on imports from each other will also comply, as long as the criteria are the same as for imports from, say, the US, China or India,” says\u0026nbspPeter Ungphakorn, formerly of the WTO Secretariat.As for EU tariffs, the opposite is the case. If the EU did not impose its common external tariff\u0026nbspon the UK after a no-deal Brexit it would be breaking WTO rules by favouring a state with which it didn’t have a free trade deal.So is the WTO really any use at all?“The WTO is not useless. Its rules are an essential part of the architecture for a peaceful and prosperous world,” says Alan Winters of the UK Trade Policy Observatory.“But they are lowest common denominator rules for trade between 164 separate and sometimes mutually hostile states, not the rules for deeply integrated, highly cooperative, sophisticated allies.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He didn’t specify which markets, although China is a racing certainty.\u0026nbspBut such a move makes all kind of sense, particularly in the aforementioned where local champion Huawei has been putting out whizzy competing handsets to tempt patriotic Chinese buyers.\u0026nbspApple has been squeezing its consumers for a long time. Will this be enough to stop the pips from squeaking?\u0026nbspThe talk of prices being ‘slashed’ certainly looks\u0026nbspover done. The iPhone is going to remain a pricey piece of kit, and recent upgrades have been obeying the law of diminishing returns.\u0026nbspThe phenomenon of people changing their handsets less often is an industry wide one, and it’s an open question as to whether relatively limited price cuts in some markets will be enough to turn back that particular tide.\u0026nbspThe reason investors have less reason to be concerned than it might appear is that the iPhone is not the only string to Apple’s bow.\u0026nbspA notable feature of the results was that while revenues from sales of the device fell by 15 per cent, group revenues fell by just 5 per cent as other parts of the business grew.The money taken in\u0026nbspfrom selling Macs increased by 9 per cent, wearables, home and accessories (iWatches, speakers, headphones) put on 33 percent,\u0026nbspthe iPad\u0026nbsp17 per cent.\u0026nbspThe most important, and closely watched, line was, however, services.

But it is closing, and the margins are stunning.\u0026nbspApple’s shares have lost nearly a third since October, driven by a widespread tech tumble as well as its own problems. It has also surrendered its much vaunted status as the world’s biggest company by market value. Accustomed to dazzling investors, the weather looks set to be cloudy for some time to come and full year revenues will likely be down on last year.\u0026nbspStill, Cook is sitting on a near $250bn cash pile, and the stock’s fall may have been over done.

Holly Exley still remembers her most outrageous offer of free work.Exley is a watercolour illustrator with a decade of experience making artwork for top-end clients, from monthly commissions of animals for BBC Wildlife Magazine, to mouthwatering illustrations for the Esquire Food and Drink Awards. But not that long ago a luxury luggage company approached her to work “in collaboration” on illustrations for their products – in return for a free suitcase.“It devalues the industry,” Exley says. “Illustration is used everywhere: from advertising to animation, packaging to publishing. It has value, and illustrators spend years honing their craft and promoting their talents, only to be asked to give it all away for free.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWhy do female freelancers earn less than male counterpartsSmall Talk: Half the workforce could be freelance soon, but ministersExley is one of hundreds of freelancers who have signed a #nofreework petition\u0026nbspstarted by The Freelancer\u0026nbspClub, a support network for freelancers in the creative industries, pledging not to accept unpaid work. The campaign, which started in 2016, is stepping up a notch in 2019 and calling for legislation to give freelancers more rights.\u0026nbspThe problem of free work is getting worse as the UK’s freelance army grows. The number of self-employed people in the UK has increased from 3.3 million in 2001 to 4.8 million in 2017, according to the ONS, contributing the most to employment growth since the financial crisis. Yet self-employed workers earn on average £240 a week, compared to £400 by those in full-time work.\u0026nbspMany young people entering creative industries like photography, graphic design or illustration take free work in return for exposure, hoping it leads to paid work further down the line. But the practice is not uncommon among experienced freelancers. In 2017, the Association for Independent Professionals estimated that free work costs freelancers with an average of seven years’ experience £5,394 a year. The law currently offers no protection and many creatives keep quiet for fear of a backlash from potential clients. \u0026nbsp“So many freelancers are scared to say anything, they are scared to name any company for fear of the backlash,” says Matt Dowling, founder of The Freelancer Club and a former freelance photographer. Since starting the campaign, he has been shocked by the stories of unpaid work and its consequences. One make-up artist couldn’t feed her children after her successful business turned into “an epidemic of unpaid work”\u0026nbspbecause so many other artists were willing to work for free.“I can’t imagine people approaching a plumber or a lawyer and asking them to work for free,” Dowling says. “But anything like photography\u0026nbspor design, anything that’s deemed to be a privilege, it doesn\u0027t get valued. Freelancers are accepting that work, and as soon as companies see that, they decide to save money.”Dowling started The Freelancer Club in 2016 after a company refused to pay him for photography work worth £11,000. It\u0026nbspnow has 30,000 members on a tiered payment scheme. Membership gives freelancers access to guides, discounts, access to paid work and legal advice. “Freelancers are told from an early stage that it’s a rite of passage to work for free,” he says. “It’s absolutely nonsense. Being an ethical company actually helps the bottom line. Millennials prefer to work for ethical companies, for instance.”Khandiz Joni is the\u0026nbspfounder of Novel Creatives, a booking platform for\u0026nbspsustainable and ethical fashion and lifestyle brands to find photographers, hair and make-up artists and other creatives\u0026nbspaligned with their ethos.\u0026nbspJoni says it has pledged not to promote free work through the #nofreework campaign.“We support this because we are freelancers and understand the very real and direct impact it has on our own livelihoods,” Joni says. “Also, working with brands that are in the area of ethics and sustainability, we feel that it is important that all parties need to be paid fairly for their work and expertise, if these brands can make claims of their fair wage principles.”Working for ethical brands and charities is just one of the grey areas Dowling and The Freelancer Club have identified. Others include work experience, collaborative projects like test shoots, where no one stands to gain, and speculative work, which can be requested by agencies for clients in anticipation of paid work.\u0026nbspBut Dowling says companies should never ask a freelancer to do professional work for free if they intend to gain from it commercially. He is calling for the UK Government to introduce legislation similar the Freelance Isn’t Free Act in New York, which establishes and enhances protection for freelance workers, specifically the right to a written contract, timely and full payment and protection from retaliation.\u0026nbspAnna Codrea-Rado, a freelance journalist and author of The Professional Freelancer newsletter, says the onus needs to be taken off the freelancer to go against a system that is already rigged.\u0026nbsp“The conversation needs to shift away from asking freelancers not to work for free, to demanding that companies not exploit the self-employed workforce,” she says.\u0026nbspThe hidden cost of self-employmentCodrea-Rado says it is not uncommon for well-established journalists to say that young journalists should never work for free. “That is a privileged statement to make that puts the onus on those at the very beginnings of their career to fight against a broken system that they did not break,” she says. “We shouldn\u0027t be telling young journalists not to write for free, it simply shouldn\u0027t be legal for a publication to commission a piece of writing without paying for it.“Exley frequently discusses issues around work and pay on her YouTube channel, which has 32,000 followers. She agrees that legislation is necessary to raise the profile of the issue and to provide security for freelancers as it becomes more popular for young creatives to go it alone.\u0026nbsp“I often feel vulnerable as a freelancer,” she says. “We don\u0027t have many of the benefits of traditional employment. We need a better support system to rely on and laws we can enforce.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Newtownabbey, Co AntrimThe uncertainty is already having a huge impact on companies in Northern Ireland. “I know a number of firms have been taking on agency workers instead of full-time staff so they have greater flexibility if it comes to a no-deal Brexit,” said Mr Kelly. “So at a minimum, Brexit is making work short-term and tenuous.”One business owner based in Northern Ireland, who did not want to be named, said Brexit was already creating problems with trade. He told The Independent that a customer based in the Republic of Ireland had already stopped working with his firm “because they are scared about what will happen after Brexit”.“We have customers asking us about what we are going to do and about our supply chains. It’s really, really difficult,” he said. “It’s the uncertainty more than anything. Business does not like uncertainty and it’s creating havoc with us.”Trading partners across Europe are nervous about the future, and investment at a standstill because of the uncertainty. “We are holding back and keeping our cash because we many need it to get over the next few years,” the businessman said. “It’s created a real issue for us going forward. We just don’t know what’s going to happen and we won’t be investing until we know what’s going to happen and until we know what happens with the customs union.“If we get into the position where we can’t trade freely across the border our competitors in the rest of Europe will jump on that and take that trade away from us.”He pointed out that if a deal is reached, there will still be two years of negotiations to get through.\u0026nbspThe alternative – a no-deal Brexit – is even more daunting. “If we go into WTO rules, that’s going to create serious issues,” he said. “Within Northern Ireland we will have a struggling economy in the UK on one side, the Republic of Ireland is going to have issues, and we will be left in the middle trying to trade. It’s a no-win situation.” Meanwhile, firms feel like they have been somewhat abandoned by the UK government. Mr Kelly said that the government’s advice to business in Northern Ireland was essentially “not to do anything”. “It’s 58 days to go – there’s food on the shelves that has a longer shelf life than that,” he added. “The Irish government has been working with industries for the past two years. We have nothing, we’ve have been left hung out, hoping for the best. It’s unacceptable.”The business owner told The Independent that communication from Westminster had been “very, very lacking”. “The whole thing has been handled particularly badly,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We are in limbo, paddling away. We aren’t growing but we haven’t contracted, so that’s something – but that could change very quickly. It’s a nightmare.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company has only once before cut iPhone prices, shortly after it debuted in 2007.Apple did not say in which countries it would adjust iPhone prices. Resellers in China already began cutting iPhone prices earlier this month after Apple lowered its sales forecast for the quarter ended in December.Apple profits fall as demand for iPhones slowsThe company priced its new iPhone XS, which was released in September, at $999, the same price in U.S. dollars as its predecessor, 2017\u0027s iPhone X.That worked for U.S. consumers, but in countries such as China and Turkey the local currency had fallen so much against the surging U.S. dollar, it made the phone significantly pricier than its predecessor a year before. Apple had essentially asked the consumer to bear the cost of the strengthening dollar.On Tuesday, Cook said Apple will adjust foreign prices in some markets by resetting them at or close to what they were one year before in local currencies. Effectively that means Apple will absorb the cost of the strengthening dollar.We\u0027ve decided to go back to (iPhone prices) more commensurate with what our local prices were a year ago, in hopes of helping the sales in those areas, Cook told Reuters in an interview.In the company\u0027s quarterly earnings call on Tuesday, Cook also highlighted the impact of foreign exchange problems in Turkey, where he said the local lira had depreciated by 33 percent against the dollar and Apple\u0027s sales were down by $700 million from the previous year. In November, Apple also cited currency pressure on its prices in Brazil, India and Russia.Apple has not said when or how often it might reset its prices because of foreign currency changes.Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the price adjustments may not extend to its services business, which includes Apple Music and the App Store.While that unit beat analyst expectations with $10.8 billion in sales in the quarter ended in December, growth has slowed compared to previous years.Maestri said slower growth was partly because prices rose for users in non-U.S. markets.Roughly 60 percent of our services business is outside the United States, and as you know, the U.S. dollar has appreciated in recent months, Maestri said. And in general, we tend not to reprice our services for foreign exchange on a very frequent basis.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As Richard walked into a vinyl-clad diner called The Hickory Pit, Steve sat –\u0026nbspbearded and burly – hunched over some sort of hand-held device, engrossed in a game of Tetris.The setting of the interview was unusual for the FT. The salmon pink daily is more widely known for its profiles of the buffed and manicured business elite, lounging in grand villas, chalets and penthouse pads, preferably in Davos or Cannes. But Steve – eating cherry pie in a washed-out T-shirt – had certainly earned his column inches: 30\u0026nbspyears earlier, together with another Steve and an electronics industry worker called Ronald, the Hickory Pit’s favourite tech geek created what would later become the world’s largest publicly traded company.

It wormed its way on to the tech scene with a creation named the Apple I, a computer designed and built by Tetris-loving Wozniak, and sold for the ominous sum of $666.66 – or about $2,900 in today’s inflation-adjusted money. Unremarkably, the name reportedly stems from Jobs’ fondness of the humble fruit.Less than a year later, the company was incorporated. Wayne had already jumped ship, having sold his stake in the group for the paltry sum of $800, but –\u0026nbspunhampered by the exit of a third of its staff –\u0026nbspApple’s operational revenues were heading north. According to media reports, they almost doubled every four months during the first five years of the company operating. Between September 1977 and the same month in 1980, sales increased by more than 500 per cent, on average annually.Apple’s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveThe Apple II and Apple III followed, and the company’s success grew with every launch. On 12 December 12 1980 it listed on the stock exchange, publicly floating around 4.6 million shares at $22 apiece. The offering turned scores of Apple’s early employees into instant millionaires. Shares in the company ended the day at $29 each, giving Jobs a net worth of well over $200 million. He was 25 at the time.In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh. Its debut was marked with a high-budget neo-noir dystopian commercial, aired during that year’s Super Bowl and directed by Bladerunner’s Ridley Scott. The release was hailed a watershed moment not just for the tech world, but also for the advertising industry. Already then Apple was inventing itself as a generation-defining, industry straddling brand a firm that challenged the status quo and confronted the norm ruthlessly.Though Jobs and Wozniak both left the company in the mid-1980s amid disputes with management, predominantly over strategy, Apple’s success initially continued untarnished.In 1991 the company created the PowerBook, presenting a blueprint for all modern laptops. That same year it launched System 7, adding colour to the interface. But not all its products proved a hit. The company was struggling to tap into its client base and it was failing to gain traction with its strategy of marketing high-end products with a high price – dubbed the High-Right Policy – while simultaneously battling heavyweight rivals, like Microsoft, which in many cases were offering similar technology at a vastly smaller price.By 1997, marred by constant leadership change, an unclear approach to the market and a series of painful restructuring exercises, Apple was forced to choose between sticking to its poorly performing guns or risking a dramatic high-stakes turnaround. It chose the latter. It snapped up NeXT, – Jobs’ new venture – for $429 million and scrapped the High-Right Policy. Shortly after, it launched the iMac G3, an affordable machine with a quirky, futuristic look that jarred with Apple’s previous designs, but spoke to a new generation of tech-savvy, progressive professionals. The move proved a lifeline for the financially bruised group and catapulted it into a new era. Apple computers were no longer just the tools of businessmen and accountants, but the product of choice for students, designers and artists. It had won over the creative elite and would continue to claim there support for many years to come.Jobs, who had returned to Apple as an adviser in early 1997, assumed the position of interim CEO when Gilbert Frank Amelio, the company’s boss since February 1996, was pushed out for overseeing several quarters of lacklustre earnings. And it was at this time too that Jonathan Ive joined the upper echelons of management, injecting fresh energy into the brand and later designing the decade-defining iPod and iPad.\u0026nbspThe 2000s were a period of revival for Apple, which the company kicked off with a wild buying spree. It snapped up a portfolio of corporations, including a DVD authoring platform and a music software group. In May 2001, doors to its first retail stores opened and it debuted the iPod, of which more than 100 million were sold over the subsequent six years. The iTunes Store launched in 2003. Within just two years it was the world’s largest music retailer. The MacPro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro hit the market with resounding success, marking the dawn of Apple’s gradual shift away from computers and towards the future of portable consumer electronics.At the Macworld Expo on January 9 2007, Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone of which hundreds of thousands were sold within hours. A year later the App Store was introduced, allowing users to buy third-party applications for their devices and generating millions of dollars of revenue within its own right.\u0026nbspIn 2010, shortly after Jobs took his first medical leave of absence, Apple introduced the iPad which was met with massive demand globally, helping the company’s market capitalisation eclipse that of arch rival Microsoft for the first time in over two decades. The iPhone 4 was released in June of that year, offering a range of new features, including video calling, and sporting a now iconic stainless steel design. The iPod Nano, iPod Touch and iPod Shuffle were also relaunched and the MacBook Air was updated, powering Apple to the top of the list of the world’s most valuable consumer brands.In dire contrast to his professional success though, Jobs’ health was deteriorating. In January 2011 he announced to staff that he would be taking another period of leave of indefinite length, handing the reigns to chief operating officer Tim Cook.\u0026nbspIn August 2011 he officially resigned as CEO. He passed away in October in Palo Alto, succumbing to a rare and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. Jobs was 56 years old.In many ways, Apple’s post-Jobs years were an era of superlatives. Thanks largely to the launch of the iPhone4S and iPhone 5, and later the iPad mini, Apple’s market value in 2012 soared to an unprecedented $624bn, beating the previous record set by Microsoft. It used that financial momentum to further its quest to ersify into newfangled fields like augmented reality and artificial intelligence. It also remained fiercely committed to design and in 2013 recruited the former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, as well as former Burberry executive Angela Ahrendts to oversee its digital strategy.Why Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple boss says data is being ‘weaponised with military efficiency’Tim Cook responds after Apple becomes first trillion-dollar companyThe company became a staple on lists of the world’s most valuable, best-known and influential brands. By January 2016 a billion Apple devices were reported to be in active use around the world. It moved into smart home technology and ride-sharing, through its investment in Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing. It bought Shazam, a music recognition service, launched its own video unit and signed a content partnership with Oprah Winfrey. Several series are reportedly in development as well as a film. Elsewhere collaborations with Hermes and Nike spurred sales of the Apple Watch, and in October 2018 it launched the twelfth generation of the iPhone. Its slogan? “Brilliant. In every way”.In\u0026nbsp2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including TurkeyIn late summer 2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including Turkey, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Sweden.\u0026nbspEmployment hit more than\u0026nbsp90,000 and, according to some reports, the company has more readily deployable cash than the US Treasury. The combined wealth of the world’s 10\u0026nbsprichest people – a list that includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, financier Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckergerg – doesn’t even come close to the size of Apple’s market capitalisation.The “too big to fail” economic theory prescribes that some organisations, particularly banks, are so large and influential, that their failure would be catastrophic for the broader economy. Apple is undoubtedly one of those organisations, and in the last few months of 2018 markets were offered a taste of what that could actually mean.Shares peaked around the launch of the latest iPhone, and started trending lower shortly thereafter. Between early October and the end of the year, Apple’s shares lost more than 30 per cent of their value, taking them to below $160 from a peak of over $230 just a week earlier, and dragging swathes of the broader stock market with them.Analysts said that investors were falling out of love with the name for a slew of reasons. Product sales were slowing and consumers were becoming more sensitive to prices amid fears of an impending economic downturn. After reporting a set of quarterly results on 1 November\u0026nbspthat reflected a weakening in crucial emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent in a single day wiping an estimated $70 billion off the group’s value.Executives at the time said that they would stop providing quarterly updates for the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers sold, unnerving investors further. The cost of new products also spawned worries, with the average selling price of iPhones climbing to $793 during the final quarter of 2018.After reporting quarterly results that reflected a weakening in emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent, wiping $70 billuon off the group’s value“Our worry is there must be a limit to Apple’s pricing power,” George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters at the time. “The group is now charging close to $800 per phone, and while that’s helping revenues climb despite flat sales volumes, one has to wonder how the strategy to shimmy up the price ladder fares in a downturn. If consumers start feeling the pinch, those price tags could put the punters off.”Analyst Chaim Siegel at Elazar Advisors told the agency that trade issues between China and the US are also threatening to throw a ner in the works if they make it hard for Apple to get the supplies it needs. “As for emerging markets slowing, that’s also contagion from China. Both trade war issues coming to reality,” he said.Elsewhere analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch slashed their recommendation on the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, explaining that they are “incrementally concerned that not all the weakness is captured in the near-term” and that there are likely to be “further negative estimate revisions” to Apple’s financials. Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their share price target on the stock repeatedly.Others have shown concern about the company’s emphasis on its services business: ApplePay, Apple Music and the App store. Potential for growth is undoubtedly there, but the company has yet to share concrete plans about its strategy going forward and how it intends to keep growing.\u0026nbspNot helping the situation, Tim Cook in early January wrote a letter to shareholders in which he announced that Apple’s results for the quarter that ended on 29 December\u0026nbsp2018 were likely to be worse than previously anticipated. Cook cited the unforeseen “magnitude” of the economic slowdown in markets such as\u0026nbspChina. The profit warning was Apple’s first since 2002 and dealt a fresh hefty blow to the share price, as well as the performance of dozens of smaller suppliers and competitors whose fate is closely linked to that of Apple. It also sent shockwaves through broader financial markets, sending stocks – which are generally considered a fairly risky asset – sharply lower in most regions and driving demand for perceived safe havens, like gold and Japan’s yen. The sell-off was a dramatic reminder of the sheer scale of the Apple ecosystem. If Apple sneezes many parts of the financial system will most certainly catch a cold.Since then Apple shares have continued to trade sideways, keeping the company’s market capitalisation well below that psychologically significant $1\u0026nbsptrillion\u0026nbspmark and raising questions about how much more correcting still needs to be done, before – or if – the trajectory can turn.So what will 2019 hold for the company which is no longer quite the world’s largest (having\u0026nbsprelinquished that role to Microsoft and Amazon)? Opinions are ided. While many experts who have been tracking the stock for years predict this to be a turning point, others consider it more of a blip.“When we get into these situations where the current product may not be moving as well as investors expected, some get scared and then the fear compounds itself,” Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investors, told Bloomberg. “We’re not really too concerned. Some of this is probably just noise like it always is.”Also speaking to the news agency, Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth \u0026amp Investment Management, described the climate of fear around Apple as “absurd”. “It doesn’t make any sense. It’s a solid business even if it’s not going to grow as much as it did,” he said.Apple is still hugely profitable. It’s sitting on well over $200 billion of cash, and shares – despite their recent brutal tumble – have roughly doubled in the past five years. The omnipresence of Apple devices across the planet also suggests that if the company’s heyday really is over, then its decline would likely be glacial rather than sudden. It simply has too many dependents, both in the corporate world and the consumer world, to swiftly fizzle out.As for Wozniak, the smiley 68-year old with a penchant for pie and Tetris, is unperturbed the ultimate bull, in market parlance. In an interview with CNBC at the end of last year, he said that Jobs would be proud of what Apple had become. Speaking of rivals, like Samsung, Wozniak said that they don’t present a real threat. They’re not innovating, he explained. They’re simply creating “fun features”. Apple, meanwhile, is concentrating on innovations that “literally affect everything we do all the time in life”.If Wozniak is right, then Apple’s dominance is far from over. Technology famously knows no limits and it’s increasingly evident that consumer appetite hardly does either. We want lives that are interconnected, homes that are smarter than us, phones that manage our whole existence and privacy that is safeguarded unconditionally.Amid all this, the most serious challenge for Apple will be to keep up with contracting attention s. In a world of instant gratification, it’s becoming clear that he who fails to innovate is lost. Perhaps, just perhaps, that will prove Apple’s greatest obstacle yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For consumers, this will reduce the availability and shelf life of many products in our stores.”So will it be these words that prove to be empty in two months’ time, or British supermarket shelves?Created with Sketch.

Still,\u0026nbspit would be foolish not to listen to the concerns of a group of companies that between them sell about half the\u0026nbspnation’s groceries.Their warning is backed up by evidence from several sources. Government figures show the UK produces 48.7 per cent of the food it eats and the proportion has been steadily declining. The rest is imported, with about two thirds of that coming from the EU.\u0026nbspAdditional border checks on thousands of containers of food each year could mean significant delays which are a particular problem for fresh fruit and vegetables (the very items we are most dependent on imports for,\u0026nbsp84 per cent of our fruit and 48 per cent of our vegetables\u0026nbspnot being homegrown).\u0026nbspEventually, supermarkets may be able to re-engineer their supply chains to restore the flow\u0026nbspof fresh produce but many goods will undoubtedly be more expensive.Rising prices of fruit and vegetables will lead to 12,400 additional cardiovascular deaths between 2021 and 2030, research published in the British Medical Journal this week estimated.While some have argued that Brexit presents an opportunity to reduce\u0026nbspour reliance on food imports and boost British farming, this cannot happen in the short term.And even if domestic production were\u0026nbspto be ramped up drastically, UK climate conditions will not be suitable for all crops. We could heat thousands of greenhouses of course, but that raises significant environmental questions.There is a saying among optimists\u0026nbspthat when life give you lemons, you should make lemonade.

The best way to do this is to support a people’s vote on the Brexit deal, and to truly give us a final say.”The fall in student support for Labour could be explained by several different reasons, but the concurrent rise in support for a new vote just as Mr Corbyn’s own MPs accuse him of prevarication over the issue is stark.At an event on the steps of parliament last week Labour and Tory MPs announced they would not table a cross-party amendment for a second referendum because it stood no chance of passing the Commons without Mr Corbyn’s support.Created with Sketch.Final Say petition delivered to Downing Street Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Today the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetToday the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetLuciana Berger, a former shadow health minister,\u0026nbspsaid: “Regrettably the Labour leadership won’t commit to an achievable policy and yet we know that the majority of Labour voters, supporters and members want a final say on any Brexit deal.“Yet at a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.”She added: “There are millions of young people in our country that supported the Labour Party at the last general election. Over two million of them were under the age of 18 in 2016. They would today now have a vote. And so many whom I speak to cannot understand why Labour is standing in the way of the younger generation having a say on this.”Three of Mr Corbyn’s MPs later moved in parliament to redraft his strategy, so it ties Labour unambiguously to giving Britain a new referendum.The leader has already submitted the Labour Party’s own amendment setting out how he thinks the country should proceed, but it disappointed many backers of the People’s Vote campaign because it failed to fully commit the party to backing a new referendum.Mr Corbyn’s approach would require ministers to find time for MPs only to “consider and vote on options” including renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and also then “legislating to hold a public vote” on any deal that successfully passes through the Commons.The Labour Party has been contacted for comment.HEPI sponsored Wave 5 of the HEPIYouthSight Monitor, which was answered by 1,048 full-time undergraduate students and undertaken between 4-8\u0026nbspJanuary.

There\u0027s no plans to organise an emergency summit to discuss any changes to the guidelines. Nor is there any pressure to hold one.He also said that the message from the EU was abundantly clear: The Withdrawal Agreement is not up for renegotiation and is not going to be reopened.\u0027Which options are being explored?\u0027 Today at PMQs Jeremy Corbyn asked what Theresa May\u0027s alternative arrangements for the backstop were\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIreland\u0027s deputy premier Simon Coveney has delivered a blow to the PM by saying there are no alternative arrangements to replace the backstop. This comes at odds to the Brady amendment backed by MPs last night.Speaking at the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) in Dublin on Wednesday, Mr Coveney said: There are currently no alternative arrangements, which anybody has put forward, which achieve what both sides are determined to achieve - to avoid a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks or controls, and protect the all-island economy, North-South co-operation and the Good Friday Agreement.Believe me, this has been explored endlessly in the negotiations over the last two years.We have seen no alternative arrangements that meet this essential threshold. We need a backstop or insurance mechanism based on legal certainty, and not just wishful thinking.He\u0026nbspadded: We are, quite simply, running out of road. As Donald Tusk was quick to spell out last night within minutes of the vote, and as had been indicated to the British Government numerous times prior to the vote, the Withdrawal Agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, is not open for re-negotiation.There has been no change in the territorial application of the Domestic Abuse Bill compared with the proposals in the government\u0027s consultation, Home Office minister Victoria Atkins has said.Ms Atkins told MPs in the Commons that in line with existing criminal law the provisions of the draft Bill expand to England and Wales only.Her comments came as Labour\u0027s Stella Creasy\u0026nbspaccused the government of drafting this Bill not with victims of domestic violence in mind but their partners in the coalition - the DUP.Asking an urgent question, she said: This Bill shows the human consequences for women across the UK of the confidence-and-supply agreement.Ms May finishes up PMQs by noting that Mr Corbyn had refused to meet her for weeks.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe says the Labour leader\u0027s proposals were rejected by the Commons and he has still not ruled out having a second referendum.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNo plan for Brexit, no good plan for our economy and no plan for our country, Ms May says.Theresa May asks Jeremy Corbyn if Labour will support a revised deal.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Labour leader says it\u0027s time for the prime minister to move away from her red lines.\u0026nbspTheresa May responds by listing \u0026nbspnumber of proposals that are currently being looked at.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTo laughter in the Commons Mr Corbyn says none of that was clear to me.\u0026nbspPlease allow a moment for the liveblog to loadMPs approved an amendment tabled by\u0026nbspSir Graham Brady\u0026nbspby 317 votes to 301 to accept Ms May’s Brexit deal as long as an alternative to the backstop could be found.However, within minutes of Ms May’s victory in the House of Commons, EU leaders ruled out renegotiating.\u0026nbsp“The backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement, and the withdrawal agreement is not open for re-negotiation. The December European Council conclusions are very clear on this point,” a statement from Donald Tusk said.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

It does not legally prevent such a scenario and rather acts a symbolic move.A further motion seeking to give MPs the legal power to request an extension to Article 50 - the Cooper amendment - and prevent a no-deal Brexit in March was actually voted down in parliament on Tuesday evening.But the Brady amendment has more significance. It is quite ambiguous, but calls for alternatives to the backstop - the EU\u0027s insurance policy in the withdrawal agreement to prevent a hard border in Ireland.Don\u0027t relax now, Theresa May – your Brexit allies are for turningEU would rather no-deal Brexit than abandon Irish backstop, May toldMay set for Brexit talks with Corbyn as EU insists \u0027no renegotiation\u0027 May wins backing to renegotiate backstop but EU says noMPs reject plan to stop no-deal Brexit in March Theresa May is using this victory in the Commons in the hope of returning to Brussels to negotiate changes to the UK-EU agreement.2 Will Theresa May be able to renegotiate the Irish backstop with the EU?While the Brady amendment does for the first time demonstrate there is a majority in the Commons for one type of Brexit, there is one very significant problem with the plan.\u0026nbspImmediately after MPs passed the amendment, European Council president Donald Tusk\u0027s spokesman said the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation. \u0026nbspFrench president Emmanuel Macron also said the agreement was not renegotiable.\u0026nbspExpect more messages today from European leaders denouncing the proposals, and a major confrontation between the UK and the EU over the next stage in the Brexit process.Downing Street aides admitted the task ahead look difficult, and Ms May herself admitted there was little appetite in Brussels for renegotiations over the backstop. But they highlighted her previous deal had been heavily defeated and that the Commons had shown what was needed to happen for the deal to pass.Created with Sketch.

questions about the deals, which will cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds.Mr Grayling also declined to explicitly reject allegations that he acted illegally, because there was no open tender

operated a ferry service and has no ships.Lilian Greenwood, the chairwoman of the Commons transport committee – which sent Mr Grayling 22 detailed questions – said he had refused to say why he had chosen to “bypass the normal procurement process”.EU would rather no-deal Brexit than abandon Irish backstop, May told“It seems extraordinary to me that the government’s response fails to provide any additional insight into why the department used emergency powers in the award of the contracts,” she said.Ms Greenwood said her committee had been told Mr Grayling had “acted illegally in securing these contracts without a full procurement process,” adding: “This was an opportunity for the secretary of state to put the record straight.”The contracts were announced just after Christmas, to help ease congestion at Dover if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal, by providing lorry capacity on different routes.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by

and increasing to four by the end of the summer.Meanwhile, the department for transport is facing accusations, including from a university reader in economic law, that the contracts break “the core rules of EU law and policy”.Eurotunnel has also protested against the “distortionary and anti-competitive effects” of a breach of “competition and state aid law”.Among questions Mr Grayling did not answer directly were:Brussels says UK should still pay into EU budget after no-deal BrexitWhat just happened with Brexit- and what happens next?Don\u0027t relax now, Theresa May – your Brexit allies are for turningBusinesses to accelerate no-deal planning after Brexit vote, CBI warns* How the companies were chosen – and how many others were approached, or made bids?* What performance measures are included in the contracts?* How many services the companies are required to run?* Whether the firms will still receive a payment if their ships “are not required or cannot be run”.In a letter, Mr Grayling defended the deals as a “responsible measure to secure capacity in the public interest in conditions of extreme urgency” – but without saying they were legal.On the use of emergency powers, he wrote: “The lead times required for acquisition of vessels, planning of fleets, marketing of routes, and necessary works at ports on each end of the routes was limited.”Mr Grayling has previously admitted the extra ferries will only deliver “around 8 per cent of normal flows across the Dover Straights”, which will be “not be sufficient to mitigate the full level of disruption possible”The

Some of the contracts last two or three years, meaning payments could continue for some time.“As highlighted on many occasions, all commitments taken by the 28 Member States should be honoured by the 28 Member States,” A statement released by the European Commission said.“This is also true in a ‘no-deal’ scenario, where the UK would be expected to continue to honour all commitments made during EU membership.”The statement continues: “Today’s proposal enables the EU to be in a position, in a ‘no-deal’ scenario, to honour its commitments and to continue making payments in 2019 to UK beneficiaries for contracts signed and decisions made before 30 March 2019, on condition that the UK honours its obligations under the 2019 budget and that it accepts the necessary audit checks and controls.EU takes less than 10 minutes to reject MPs’ demand to bin backstop“This would help mitigate the significant impact of a “no-deal” scenario for a wide range of areas that receive EU funding, such as research, innovation or agriculture.\u0026nbsp“This issue is separate from and without prejudice to the financial settlement between the EU and the United Kingdom in a no-deal scenario.”Officials admit they cannot force the UK to make any payments once it has left the bloc, though they hope Britain\u0026nbspwill take up the offer.Though the EU has ruled out doing ‘side deals’ with the UK to soften a no-deal Brexit, the move on the budget contributions suggests the commitment is open to interpretation.\u0026nbspThe Commission says its no-deal planning “cannot replicate the withdrawal agreement”, is “unilateral” and is aimed at mitigating the “most disruptive effect on EU27 stakeholders”. It has stepped up preparations in recent weeks and months, with 88 stakeholder notices and 18 legislative proposals.What just happened with Brexit- and what happens next?EU would rather no-deal Brexit than abandon Irish backstop, May toldMay wins backing to renegotiate backstop but EU says noOn Wednesday it also unveiled measures to protect the Erasmus international study programme, confirming that it would honour the overseas placements of UK and EU27 students who were abroad at the time of a no-deal. This commitment affects around 7,000 UK nationals on the continent and 14,000 EU nationals in the UK.Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said last year that “the Government would not pay the terms of the financial settlement, as agreed with the EU as part of the withdrawal agreement” in the event of a no-deal, because\u0026nbsp”there’s no deal without the whole deal”. It is not clear whether the Government’s policy has shifted since Mr Raab’s departure, however, with the issue of the orce bill falling off the agenda and the focus moving to Northern Ireland.In September Theresa May said “the position changes” on the issue of the payments if the UK left without a deal: leaving herself room for manoeuvre.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The aim was to make people give up their right to vote. People overcame fear and went out to vote. We know many tried to do so unsuccessfully.”He said that he and his former colleagues have been accused of crimes of rebellion and are facing prison sentences of up to 25 years.“No violence action has been carried by the people who are being prosecuted,” he added.Mr Puigdemont held a private meeting with Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald in the Republic of Ireland. He would not, however, be drawn on whether he would support Ms McDonald’s call for a poll on the question of the Irish border following Brexit.He said: “I want to remain very respectful considering the internal domestic decisions. It’s not my duty or goal to talk about the Irish and UK relationship or what happens if there is a hard Brexit or no-deal.“I have my personal opinion but I insist we must, as Catalan people, respect the decision of the UK and Ireland.

The “backstop” would see Britain mirror EU rules indefinitelyno new trade deal is in place to keep the Northern Irish border open.The EU now suggests a longer post-Brexit transition until December , citing lack of progress. It would see us paying Brussels billions extra.But Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab insisted that it must be “time-limited” and cannot leave Britain “in definite limbo”.However he stopped short of demanding a named date as Brussels has rejected this and Downing Street said his stance was consistent with the PM.No said the PM would never agree to a deal which would trap the UK in a backstop permanently.” But Ireland said having an open ended backstop was “a deal-breaker” for them.Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said: “The backstop needs to be there unless and until something better comes along. Nobody wants to use the backstop - this is like taking out fire insurance on your house.”But yesterday Philip Hammond explicitly stated the temporary period would be needed to be invoked.Mrs May has always insisted the backstop is unlikely to ever be needed, yet Mr Hammond said: “It is true that there needs to be a period - probably following the transition period that weve negotiated and before we enter into our long-term partnership.Mrs May now heads to Brussels on Wednesday to meet fellow EU leaders for a crunch summit that faces deadlock.Meanwhile open civil war broke out between Tory MPs and their crucial DUP allies over the issue, after the Northern Irish threatened to dethrone the PM.And as Sun columnist James Forsyth reveals today, some senior figures in the DUP want the PM to be ousted within weeks.Tory MP Nick Boles hit out: “Conservative leaders are chosen by Conservative MPs and Conservative Party members. Not by MPs of any other party. And we respond no better to threats than proud Ulster men or women do.And it emerged Eurocrats are mulling plans to prolong the transition period in a bid to stop the DUP torpedoing a Brexit deal.Sources said the withdrawal pact could be changed so the  month window can be extended to reassure Unionists the backstop will never be needed.The EU is making a demand of Theresa May she cannot fulfil without national humiliation, mass Cabinet resignations and near-certain Commons defeat.Brussels must know it is utterly unreasonable to demand we stay locked in their customs union indefinitely. Or that they should dictate when we can finally leave. Which they never would.A .million majority voted to leave. MPs voted that meant leaving the customs union. Our democracy, sovereignty and trading future are all at stake. Mrs May must defend all three. God knows what happens next weekshe doesn’t.The Remain ultras should be loving this chaos. Except they have suffered their own disaster. The EU sayswe held a second referendum and voted Remain, they’d strip us of our historic rebate on payments to Brussels.So along with violent unrest, a ­collapse of trust in democracy and a huge surge in extremism, Remaining would come with a whole new price tag on top of EU membership fees: Four thousand million quid a year.Good luck selling that.But the plot will enrage Brexiteers, who fear efforts to trap Britain permanently in the Single Market and Customs Union as a vassal state.During a transition the UK will be banned from striking trade deals and will have to keep making budget payments, while following EU rules without any say.Sources said Michel Barnier is considering a new plan that would see the transition stay in place until the end of  - meaning a two year, nine month phase.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Everything would be settled. But we’re not going to get a deal.We’re going to get a withdrawal agreement and our future trading relationship will not be determined until after we’ve left the European Union.That is not what the British people were promised that is not what they voted for.

To proceed without informed consent would be a catastrophic mistake.”Labours policy is to keep all options on the tablethe party can’t seek a general election including a second vote.But Corbyns reluctance to commit to another referendum so close to Brexit day is costing him with some members.According to polling, Labour members are signicantly more opposed to Brexit than Corbyn, with  per cent thinking their leader should support a second vote.Corbyn is the only Westminster party leader to have refused to meet the Prime Minister following the overwhelming rejection of her withdrawal plan, insisting she must first rule out a no-deal Brexit.He is not expected to make a judgement on whether to move towards backing a second referendum until after the Government’s “Plan B” Brexit strategy is voted on in Parliament.Labour wants to prioritise pursuing its own version of Brexit – with a customs union, a close relationship to the single market, and stronger protections for workers’ rights and environmental standards.Labour backbencher David Lammy has warned that Jeremy Corbyn risks splitting the partyhe doesnt back a second EU referendum.Mr Lammy told Sky Newss Ridge On Sunday: There is a small group in our party who are so frustrated, who have so much grievance, the fear is they are going to go off and form another party.Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said he was open to extending Article that meant Britain avoided leaving the EU without a deal.He has also ramped up pressure on Corbyn to back a second EU referendum by insisting the option remain on the table."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004609318361.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"john bercow out of parliament tories replace him","story":"Today the chairman of the Tory Buckingham association is meeting the Conservative party’s national head of candidate selection Gareth Fox to find a suitable figure to fight the seat.He wants the party to start advertising the position from today.The Speaker has stood unopposed in his Buckingham seat since standing down as a Tory MP in  to take the neutral role of Speaker.But the Tories are hoping he will quit before the next election to free up the seat.The move will put pressure on Mr Bercow amid the outrage over claims he is helping Remainer MPs thwart Brexit in the Commons.When he was elected in  Mr Bercow had pledged to only serve until  but has cited the uncertainty over Brexit to justy staying on.It was understood he would only extend his tenure until June this year but Tories now fear he will use the deepening Brexit crisis to cling on longer and even beyond the next General Electiona snap vote is called.But that would be the fourth General Election in a row at which the Buckingham seat is left uncontested.Buckingham Tory association chairman Cllr Clive Harriss said anger was rising among constituents over their lack of a choice for MP at elections.He said the party would traditionally only start looking for a new candidate when the Speaker stands down.But he told The Sun: “We’ve started to put feelers out with a view we’ll have someone in place soan election is calledhe decides not to stand we’ll have someone in place to fight the seat in the normal way.“I’ll be talking to central office on Friday to make sure they advertise the position.”However he admitted the party has “absolutely no influence” over when Mr Bercow decides to stand down.Mr Harriss added: “We don’t know what’s going to happenthere is a General Election.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Taxes will rise. We’ll even run out of Mars bars.But across the Atlantic, something has been ­happening that should give us all some perspective.Over the past decade, Venezuela has plunged into the abyss — but there’s been no civil war, no earthquakes or hurricanes.Just a brutal, corrupt government that has turned what was once Latin America’s richest country into a hellhole.Starvation rations plunged millions into hunger and ­malnutrition, with some resorting to eating dogs, cats, even zoo animals.People got into kne fights over the right to scavenge from a dumpster.Its economy is more than three times smaller than in . Inflation climbed into the thousands, then millions of per cent.The result has been a refugee crisis on the scale of the Syria conflict.No wonder tens of ­thousands of people took to the streets of the capital Caracas this week, declaring national assembly head Juan Guaido the legitimate president.All this is awful for the poor bloody Venezuelans.But what does it have to do with Britain The answer is that Venezuela wasn’t just a ­disaster. It was an experiment — cheered on by Jeremy Corbyn and his cronies.In , Hugo Chavez took over Venezuela.He ruled until his death in , when he was succeeded by his hand-picked protege Nicolas Maduro.Chavez modelled himself on Latin American ­revolutionaries like Fidel Castro and Simon Boli. He nationalised much of the oil industry — which dominates the ­Venezuelan economy — and imposed punitive taxes on foreign firms.He introduced price controls and later currency controls. He declared “economic war” on the “stateless ­bourgeoisie” and seized the goods of private companies he denounced as saboteurs.For Corbyn, the Chavez regime was an inspiration — a chance to see true socialism brought to le.Venezuela, Corbyn has said, “showed us that there is a dferent, and a better, way of doing things. It’s called socialism”.It wasn’t just Corbyn. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott and Corbyn’s media chief Seumas Milne have all praised the ­Venezuelan revolution.That “better way of doing things” has ruined tens of millions of lives but there has not been a hint of an apology from Corbyn.Normally, the fact that people are taking to the streets to free themselves of a vicious regime would be cheered to the rafters by the Left.Instead, there is the silence of those who find themselves ­hideously embarrassed.The few who are not ­staring at their shoes claim that Venezuela has been the ­victim of an American plot.That Maduro took, in McDonnell’s words, a “wrong turn” from Chavez’s true socialism.That it was all down to a falling oil price.Yes, Maduro took a wrong turn. But that turn was to follow the path laid out by Chavez.From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, there is a long and shabby history of British left-wingers acclaiming a workers’ paradise — only to declare, once its ­failure is clear, that it wasn’t really socialist after all.Never mind the millions of lives ruined — let’s have another go!If he became Prime ­Minister, Corbyn might not succeed in turning Britain into Venezuela.

They are paid to inspire you to buy stuff.Most insist they only endorse ­products they actually believe in — and we’d all hope they take their responsibility seriously.But it is easy to see how an offer of, say, £, to endorse something they “sort of” believe in might make it harder to hang on to those principles.Equally,guidelines aren’t strictly enforced, you can understand the temptation to convey the impression that you just happen to really like a particular laxative herbal tea, say, or a moisturiser that gives you a “glow”.It’s a grey area. And you might ask why it matters.But given recent news about the ­negative impact social media can have on the mental health of young people — and young women in particular — regulation of this brave new world affects us all.I need only point to another big story this week.Schoolgirl Molly Russell was  when she took her own le after showing “no obvious signs” of severe mental health issues.Her family later found she had been viewing material on social media linked to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide.Her father even went as far as accusing Instagram of “helping to kill her”.Social media makes it so easy to tap into someone’s daily le, their home-decor proclivities and their innermost thoughts.The intimate nature of Instagram lets you feel like these influencers are your friends, and the products they rave about their personal ­recommendations, not the outcome of a business deal.This is a real problem. But the mistake is much harder to makeadverts are clearly labelled as such.Part of the problem is how obsessed with celebrities our young people have become.When I was growing up, my main influenceswere my parents and my friends.Now, young people are influenced by people they will never meet.Some of these people, dare I say it, are talentless nobodies.You might argue you would have to be naive not to realise they are selling you something.Perhaps young people are not as cynical as the likes of me.And that is why regulation is key.IT’S hard to sympathise with Fungi, a “star” of hit telly documentary Benefits Street, who says universal credit is “the worst thing in the world”.Tracked down by this paper, James Clarkeclaimed his monthly payments had been more than halved and the all-in-one benefit was causing “hell” for him and others like him . . . because their booze budget has been cut.Fungi was claiming £ a month to spend on food and sundries. But this was slashed to £ – which doesn’t cover the £ a month he and his partner spend on strong cider.His rent, meanwhile, is paid in full via a separate taxpayer-funded handout.Fungi also says his drinking habit means he can’t work. Sorry, what Here’s another way of looking at it. People who work for eight hours a day don’t have the time to down three litres of cider a day.If Mr Clarke got a job, he might recover some of his self-esteem – and probably save his le in the process.Just to be clear – I BELIEVE in the benefits system.But it was invented to help people get back on their feet, to help those who can’t help themselves because of illness or disability.It should be a short-term measure, not a lestyle choice.In the meantime, the rest of us go to work to pay for this man’s rent and booze.All because he can’t be bothered to sort himself out.No wonder people get angry.In fact, I suspect most readers will have steam coming out of their ears.This man must start taking responsibility for himself.I SUPPOSE it was worth a shot for Diane Abbott to complain that Fiona Bruce was “badly briefed” and that her treatment as a list on Question Time was racist.But she can’t blame Fiona for her own incompetence in answering questions – and not just on Question Time.There are so many car-crash interviews to choose from . . . although the one in which Diane suggested police officers could be paid £ a year springs to mind.WHAT a nasty piece of work Dancing On Ice judge Jason Gardiner seems.We expect the judges to give feedback.And we know it won’t all be good.But his comment to Gemma Collins last week – “We are not going to see big lts from you” – came across as body-shaming.Because his real point is that she is overweight, right It’s shocking, really. I’m surprised ITV allowed it.THE secret behind Elle Macpherson’s phenomenal bod has been revealed.In an interview, she said it all comes down to . . . late breakfasts.Hmmm.

These people are ­consistent and have my respect.But there are just as many who are in danger now of sitting on the fence until rigor mortis sets in, coming up with process rather than substance.They are simply hoping that others will do the dirty deed and respect the will of the people.It is also, for every Labour and Conservative MP, the manesto ­promise that we stood on at the last election. We voted for a referendum. We promised to respect the result.We got re-elected promising the same, yet Parliament continues to sit on the roundabout to nowhere.It is time to stop the shenanigans and work across the political ide to bring our country and our people together.At stake is our democracy. And in a democracy the winner prevails.Of course, in future years, people can argue that we have got it wrong and that people are entitled to change their mind. But for democracy to be true and real, we have to deliver the mandate we have been given and leave the EU on March .The referendum ided people and families, with lots of strong and dfering views. But in cherishing our democracy, we now need to come together to deliver a Brexit that respects the people’s vote and helps heal that ide.In le we have to compromise. We all have our own perfect Brexit, me included. And with ten of my colleagues we have forced through a big part of that, guaranteeing in law workers’ rights, health and safety and environmental standards. We will be competing with Europe by being the best, not by being the cheapest.I would love to have been a fly on the wall when Theresa May told union bosses that she was meeting their key demands not just with a promise but with a legal guarantee. But then she knew it was only right, because union members were the bedrock of leave voters across the country.And, I believe, we can get more in the next fortnight. A clear commitment to a once-in-a-generation investment into the Leave-voting areas that have long been starved of our fair shares — those former coal, iron and steel industrial heartlands, the unfashionable places, the areas still manufacturing. I think, as well, that union bosses and industrialists can be brought to act as advisers to the trade negotiations when we have left the EU, bringing their expertise into play to ensure a jobs-first Brexit for Britain.A country, proud and independent, standing on its own two feet, ­confident again in our democracy, bold enough to compete by being the best, British workers making high- quality products and delivering high-quality services.A country that says it will be the best by having better pay, conditions and a healthier environment than anyone  in Europe or worldwide.Is that not something to be confident in voting for, my fellow MPs  Let’s get on with it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Along with the likes of megabucks Remainers Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson and PR guru Roland Rudd, he seems to think Brexiters are basically pond le.That theory should be buried forever after this weekend’s passionate plea from leading academic Sir Noel Malcolm for MPs to stop wrecking Brexit.Writing in the devoutly pro-EU Financial Times, this distinguished Fellow of All Souls, Oxford, spells out the essence of the Leave case: “Brexit is about sovereignty — and parliament must respect that.”“If the UK is now on the brink of a constitutional crisis,” he adds, “one major reason is that a signicant number of MPs still oppose any version of Brexit, and seek a second ­referendum solely for the sake of reversing the decision of the last one.”Sir Noel does not believe people voted Out because they were racist.“The most important reason was democracy,” he says.“They wanted to live under laws made by the people they elected. Immigration came second.What they objected to was a supranational government ­making some of their laws and lting all immigration controls on the inhabitants of  other countries.”Another Remainer fiction is that Brexiters are narrow-minded Little Englanders.Yet the Daily Mail found space for a German view that Brussels should stop “insulting Britain” and honour us as champions of peace in Europe.“Such blinkered and sour responses are wrong-headed,” says Alexander von Schoenburg, a senior editor of Germany’s biggest newspaper, Bild.“They ignore the great debt Germany and the whole ­Continent owes our friends across the Channel.“We must always remember that throughout your history, independence and sovereignty have been paramount.“Germany in particular should tread lightly when it comes to dealing with your proud nation. It was Great Britain that first stood up to Hitler in .And it was Britain that opened its doors to thousands of ­Jewish refugees fleeing certain death during the Holocaust.“Put simply, there would be no free Europe without you and the bloody sacrice you made to rescue the Continent.”This remarkable tribute ­follows a recent love letter to the UK from Germany’s next Chancellor calling for a friendly Brexit orce and an end to bitterness.It is now clear hardline Remainers have over-reached themselves. The worm has turned.Talk of a second referendum is dead and voters are on the warpath against MPs plotting to scupper Brexit in tomorrow’s Commons showdown.Brussels is in chaos over the Northern Ireland backstop.Michel Barnier has started muttering about new tech- nology to police post-Brexit ­frontiers — a UK idea initially dismissed as “magical thinking”.EU allies are breaking ranks to demand a decent deal — for their sake as much as ours.It is way past time now for Theresa May to scrap the backstop and tell Brussels exactly what she needs to get her deal through Parliament.“There is absolutely no truth in speculation that ­passengers are being advised not to book,” stormed Brittany Ferries as it announced plans to INCREASE services.Meanwhile, mischief-making aviation giant Airbus admits it was asked by Downing Street to warn – incredibly – that it would shut up shopBritain left without a deal.Project Fear is shameless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are useless. Have a trophy.”And it’s a depressing cycle that will continue for as long as there are National Television Awards, live from The O.A ceremony where the categories may chop and change every year, but the stupidity remains ritualised.As well as getting all the usual winners though, viewers also had to endure a technical nightmare on Tuesday, where things went wrong — from the shambolic opening scenes right through to the unedited version of the closing credits: “With thanks to — Television Centre White City or just Television Centretoo long.”It’s always a case of fine margins, of course, at the NTAs, and the evening might have strayed into so-bad-it’s-good territorythe cameras had just focused on one of the Love Island gang when host Dermot O’Leary said: “Danny DeVito will be in Dumbo next year.”They didn’t, though. So a night bedevilled by sound issues, rotten acceptance speeches and foul Danny Dyer language was crowned by Special Recognition winner David Dimbleby eulogising the BBC and ordering us to be nicer to politicians, in a speech that could hardly be descri- bed as “mood capturing”.It’s the awards themselves though, that I know get viewers’ goats the most, starting, painful as it is to admit, with the fact perennial winners This Morning absolutely robbed Piers Morgan’s Good Morning Britain operation in the Daytime category.Given that Jack Whitehall’s Travels With My Father managed to scrape on to the Comedy shortlist, there’s also an argument that says Chunk, Charlotte Hawkins, Richard Arnold and Susanna Reid — who was styled quite magnicently on the night as Waitrose’s answer to Vicky Pattison — should have made that final five as well.Because almost no show made me laugh as loud or as regularly as Good Morning Britain did in .A glaring omission too in the TV Judge section — always won by David Walliams — which included X Factor’s Robbie Williams on the shortlist, but not Craig Revel Horwood, who didn’t take a two-week sabbatical in the middle of Strictly, cost the BBC £million or throw in his other half as part of the deal.The award that made a nonsense of the whole occasion though was Ant  Dec winning Best Presenters for the th time in a row, despite the presence of Bradley Walsh and Graham Norton on the shortlist, and the fact Ant spent far more weeks in rehab than he did in a TV studio.The mutual affection is touching in one way, of course, but it ultimately does neither them nor the NTAs any good at all and has robbed both of a glorious moment of redemption when they win the  award.Before that foregone conclusion takes place, please stay tuned to This Morning and sit tight until mid-March, when Dr Chris will be along with part II of his bottom-wiping masterclass: Flushing, FLU-SHING.Practially the only programme I watched at the weekend that wasn’t punctuated by uncontrollable sobbing fits from the participants was BBC’s landmark Holocaust documentary The Last Survivors.Men and women who are all in their late eighties and nineties now and understand that time is precious.When you’re a living part of history you also know facts are far more precious than tears.So in the words of the remarkable Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who avoided the Auschwitz gas chamber purely because she could play the cello: “I won’t give people the pleasure of seeing my emotions.”The very least we owe all of them is an audience. The Last Survivors is available on the BBC iPlayer and will probably be the most unforgettable  minutes of television you’ll watch all year.At approximately : hours, Sunday, Gemma Collins stumbled over while Dancing On Ice.The tectonic plates groaned a little on impact, the front row scattered like ten pins and there was a surge on the national grid as several million viewers went “click, rewind, play,” then “click, rewind, play,” again.In fact, by the time I’d stopped rewinding and playing, Gemma had “bounced back,”and Piers Morgan, no doubt angling for a Le Stories interview, had claimed it was “the gutsiest thing I’ve seen on a talent show” – probably since the days Piers himself was wedged in behind the judges’ desk on Britain’s Got Talent.It was an undeniably great television moment, though.A proper face plant, with a full Klinsmann snow plough to finish.The downside, obviously, is that it’s guaranteed she’ll be back next week, when Melody, Wes, James and the others will be performing to a Fairytale theme and Gemma will be clearing the B Fettercairn to Banchory road,ITV want to find a proper use for her.Click, rewind, play.Things remain cheerful as hell on EastEnders.Alfie Moon’s car has been discovered near some clfs and a policeman has the job of breaking the most awful news imaginable to Kat and the Slaters.“Considering the location and the evidence at hand, we would suggest you prepare yourself for the worst.”Big Mo: “You understand what they’re saying ”Yes, bloody Redwater’s getting a second series.

But she also says Britain will not leave the EU without a deal.And her deal — the only one on the table at this late stage — was defeated in the House of Commons by a record majority just two weeks ago.Tonight’s Brexit votes are not quite the final shoot-out between the dferent factions in Parliament. The Government has promised that MPs will vote soon on a new plan.Remainers and soft Brexit supporters in government are pushing to hold that vote as soon as possible.And MPs — backed by a Speaker who will rewrite any Commons rules to soften or stop Brexit — will force more votes on what happens next.Nevertheless, tonight’s votes do matter.One proposal comes from Yvette Cooper, a Labour MP.Her Yorkshire constituents voted to leave the EU by more than two to one and, during the election, she promised them she would “not vote to block Brexit.”Yet that is what her plan does:     MPs vote for her   amendment, they will be able to stop Brexit happening this year.Cooper has the support of several rebel Tories, soJeremy Corbyn whips his MPs to vote for it, she stands a good chance of getting her way.Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, Conservative and Labour, have an amendment that calls on the Government to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Dominic Grieve wants MPs to control the Commons timetable, allowing Parliament to vote on dferent ways of watering Brexit down.Labour want to present MPs with options that include, predictably, a second referendum.Despite drafting a manesto saying “Labour accepts the referendum result”, the Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer says in a second referendum he would campaign to overturn the result of the first.It is possible that none of these amendments might pass.Remainers and soft Brexiteers are ided about what should happen.Some want to delay Brexit, some want to tie us to European rules and regulations, and others want another referendum to stop it altogether.Evenno proposal wins a Commons majority, the votes cast by MPs will probably demonstrate that there is a majority to water down Brexit one way or another.For Brexit supporters, this is very dangerous indeed.Some believe they simply need to run down the clock and, in  days, we can leave without a deal.For Leavers who want a negotiated departure, this feels like a serious risk.But Leavers who favour no deal need to ask themselves, can they really be so sure they will get what they want With several Cabinet ministers, many more junior ministers and a Commons majority against no deal, it seems increasingly likely that MPs will ultimately find a way of stopping no deal.When they do, Brexit will only get softer and softer.This is why the amendment proposed by Graham Brady, a senior Conservative, is so important.His idea is to approve the Prime Minister’s original Brexit deal, but with the “backstop” removed.The backstop is hated by unionists, because to prevent barriers to trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland, it creates new barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.And it is hated by Leavers, because it ties the UK to the EU’s customs union, and Northern Ireland to EU single market rules.Brady wants MPs to vote simply for “alternative arrangements” to the backstop.By avoiding a specic proposal, he hopes the amendment can win a Commons majority and, in doing so, demonstrate to Brussels that the deal they struck with Theresa May can be ratied — but only without the backstop.Critics, largely Remainers, say this is impossible.But in the past week or so, Angela Merkel has questioned whether the backstop is such a good idea after all.The Polish foreign minister has suggested it should expire after five years. And the European Commission effectively conceded that in the event of no deal, they would use policy and technology to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In other words, they proposed solutions they once dismissed as “unicorns” and “magical thinking” when they were suggested by the British — and which could render the backstop unnecessary.But this is not all. Some European officials have floated, in private, a more inventive solution: that the UK and Ireland should form a British Isles customs zone, with Britain compensating Ireland for any new friction in their trade with Europe.So it is clear: whatever Remainers claim, alternatives to the backstop are technically and politically feasible.Recognising this, the Brady amendment would give the Government one last chance to negotiate something better.Yet Tory Brexiteers say they might not vote for it. They fear the ambiguity of “alternative arrangements” could allow ministers to negotiate an even worse deal, perhaps tying the whole of the UK to the EU’s customs union and single market rules for good.They do not trust May, her advisers, or most of her Cabinet and demand a specic time limit on the backstop.Butthey vote down the Brady amendment, they will not get what they want, and are more likely to get what they fear.As the clock ticks on and bottoms get even squeakier, MPs will coalesce around a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit.The EU will have no reason to compromise, and Parliament will soften our departure by aligning us with more and more European laws.If Leavers vote against Brady, they will be shooting themselves not in one foot, and not even in both feet, but in the head.As the Commons debates the proposals today, Leavers need to start compromising with reality. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are not trying to hide the gravestones away so the details clearly show them.“But although the house still has the original two doors at the front, the main entrance is at the back via a driveway on the side.“It means that people don’t have to walk down the path between the graves into the house.“Also when you are inside the house, you are not really overlooking the graves because of the layout inside.“I am hoping that perhaps it might appeal to someone from outside the area.”Mr Dutton said the chapel had been bought and turned into a high-quality home with “a wonderful light-filled interior” by a local developer.The developer originally planned to live there before changing his mind and putting it on the market as he wanted to move nearer his childrens’ schools.It was originally up for sale at £, with a dferent agent before it was taken on by Bedfords, who cut the price to £, before cutting it again.Mr Dutton believes the house, which has a new roof and windows, is worth at least £, more than its price tag due to the quality of the conversion.He said: “It just seems buyers are put off which is such a shame as the cost of the conversion far outweighs the price it’s for sale for.“Someone is going to get a real bargain. It might be that once a year, on Halloween, it becomes an issue but most people could live with that.”It has , square feet of living space and underfloor heating with a castellated side extension still bearing the name “Wesleyan Day School.”The graveyard at the front is still owned by the church authorities on a -year lease, meaning they are responsible for its upkeep.Among the graves is a headstone belonging to Jon Cousins, a minister of a Methodist chapel in Diss who died  in .The master bedroom with an en suite bathroom is on the ground floor along with two further bedrooms, a utility room, and family bathroom.Downstairs is a kitchen with oak flooring and state of the art cabinets, an island, granite worktops and a range-style oven.The first floor has a galleried landing around three sides of the building which Bedfords say could be used as a playroom, study areas or hobby space.There is also plenty of built-in storage space and a good-sized garden at the rear with a double cart lodge."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/car-11.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"frustrated school run mum parks her car in the middle of a roundabout and insists she can leave it there","story":"The woman was spotted by cops who gave her a hefty fine, but the motorist wasnt having any of it.According to Birmingham Live, the woman claimed that she was in her rights to park in the middle of the road.The altercation between the motorist and the cops took place outside Swanhurst School after parents and staff moaned about careless parking.But this isnt the first time a brazen parent has flaunted the rules and turned a blind eye to parking rules.A Mercedes driver was caught on the same roundabout in Billesley, Birmingham.Billesley Police said: PCSO Owen and PCSO Yasin have attended Swanshurst School regarding several issues this morning.Please be considerate when dropping your children off to school.

But Glengorm is in the Central North Sea and this find shows there is still le in some of the more mature UK waters.The Oil and Gas Authority branded the discovery “very exciting news”.And Andy Samuel, chief executive of the regulator, said there is every chance of yet more signicant finds”.But environmental groups have slammed the find, saying the venture will contribute to climate change.They want energy firms to leave oil and gas in the ground and use renewable resources.Caroline Rance, from Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: Its a disgrace that oil and gas exploration is still going ahead in the seas off Scotland.Its high time our governments stopped supporting fossil fuel development, and get serious about planning a just transition away from this industry.Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said the announcement, highlights the signicant potential for oil and gas which still exists beneath Scotlands waters.He added: Scotlands offshore oil and gas industry has an important role to play with up to  billion barrels of oil equivalent remaining under the North Sea and in the wider basin and discoveries such as this help to support security of supply as we make the transition to a low carbon energy system."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000465240165.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"women short skirts plunging neck lines promoted","story":"But they are assumed to be lazier and to have done worse at uni than those in a suit or long dress.Yet older adults say women who opt for the “sexy” look are still likely to have an advantage over those who dress “professionally”.Researchers showed  people photos of  female graduates — one group in provocative outfits and the other reserved.The , which included professors, other female students and adults from the wider population, graded the pictures.

Both are powered by an inexorable sense of self-righteousness. And both have an awful lot of experience of saying sorry.The most recent example came when Sir Nick appeared on the BBC in the wake of the furore over the death of -year-old Molly Russell.It turned out, after she was found dead in her bedroom in December , that she had been viewing material online relating to depression, self-harm and suicide — material which was shockingly easy to find.As her father Ian Russell put it bluntly: “Instagram helped kill my daughter.”Sir Nick, to his credit, said all the right things about how the firm was determined to do more. But he also made the striking claim that it is sometimes better for Facebook and Instagram to keep suicide images online, because it helps other vulnerable young people get support.This after The Sun, on Saturday, found and flagged up multiple images appearing to normalise and even romanticise suicide, all within a few clicks. Many remained published for days, and a Facebook spokesman claimed they could be beneficial to users battling mental health issues.Sir Nick says the firm is following the advice from leading experts and charities. And it may well be doing the right thing. But this is the latest example of Facebook — and other social media giants in general — only acting to tackle a problem once it becomes impossible not to.Over the past decade, social media has come to dominate our lives. The latest research from Ofcom shows internet use rocketing among children and teenagers, with friendships and social lives increasingly run through screens and phones.And it is now clear that this great move online has been accompanied, for our children, by a staggering increase in mental health problems.The situation is particularly alarming when it comes to young women. The latest NHS data found that one in four of those aged  to  report having a mental health disorder — twice the rate among boys.In  alone, one in five US girls aged between  and  suffered a major depressive episode — one in five! Suicide rates for teenage girls, according to academic Jonathan Haidt, have risen by  per cent in the US and  per cent in the UK in a decade.This isn’t just about what happens on the internet. Those having problems online often tend to be experiencing problems offline too, such as bullying, harassment or broken families.More broadly, Haidt believes the “snowflake” phenomenon reflects that “helicopter parenting” leaves children less prepared to cope with shocks and dficulty. But the internet, and social media, are very clearly intensying those problems. And the big tech firms are still playing catch-up.The traditional argument from Silicon Valley is that it’s not their job to regulate human behaviour. They add that eventhey wanted to, there is simply too much out there.They are doing their best to crack down on inappropriate content, but it’s like trying to stem the tide. Behind the scenes — they insist — thousands of people are working day and night to detect and delete messages promoting terrorism, hatred, Holocaust denial and self-harm.But this argument just doesn’t wash. It’s very clear that, in the interests of their bottom lines, many of the big social media firms have long failed to put enough resources into detecting damaging content.Researchers have shown, for example, how following the recommended links from reputable YouTube content can lead to a carnival of horrors. News reports that segue into crackpot conspiracy theories and videos for toddlers that give way to horrendous scenes of a bloodied Minnie Mouse trapped in an escalator.Every day brings new horror stories, such as rival fans of royals Kate and Meghan using the Kensington Palace Instagram to send death threats to each other. Increasingly, online hate is triggering real-le violence. The slaughter of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma was, The New York Times said, “a genocide incited on Facebook”.Part of the reason that Zuckerberg has hired Clegg is to put his house in order. Clegg has talked the right talk about changing Facebook’s culture, and in particular doing more to tackle self-harm.He even says they might start paying more tax. ButZuckerberg’s answer to “how to fix the internet” is “hire Nick Clegg”, we have still got an awfully long way to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My colleagues and I will talk to the EU about how we address the house’s views.As I said this afternoon, there is limited appetite for such a change in the EU and negotiating it will not be easy.But in contrast to a fortnight ago, this house has made it clear what it needs to approve a withdrawal agreement.Now MPs have signalled they want “alternative arrangements” to the hated Northern Ireland backstop, then she can tell the EU thatthey make the change, Parliament is almost certain to sign it off in the coming weeks.Mrs May will speak to EU leaders today and the rest of the week - and could dash to Brussels for emergency talks too to thrash out a compromise.Jean-Claude Juncker has already ruled it out, but the PM could go around him to talk to the heads of the other EU states.If they manage to get a change, she will then give MPs another vote on her deal within weeks.If not, the PM will probably tell her MPs it’s her deal or nothing, having fought with the EU as much as possible but to no avail.MPs who fear crashing out could then turn around at the last minute and back the deal.Responding, Jeremy Corbyn agreed for the first time to attend talks on Brexit at  Downing Street.He said: The Prime Minister must now face the reality that No Deal is not an option. I will meet the Prime Minister and others from across Parliament to find a sensible Brexit solution that works for the whole country.Boris Johnson hailed the PMs victory, saying the result was “clear unambiguous good news” and a “huge victory for Britain”.The Tory big hitter said: “The PM now has a mandate from Parliament that the backstop, the thing that keeps us locked in the single market, the customs union, has to come out.“Parliament has very clearly said there has to be a change. I hope our friends in Brussels will listen and make that change.Odds of the PMs deal getting passed shortened as a delay to Article  became less likely.Opening the debate this afternoon, Mrs May hinted at support for a new Brexit plan dreamed up by an unlikely alliance of Leavers and Remainers from across the Conservative party.The proposal, dubbed the Malthouse compromise after Housing Minister Kit Malthouse, would see an extended transition period designed to avoid chaos even in the event of a No Deal outcome.Mrs May said: While there are obviously details that need to be worked through, the fact that leading figures from dferent sides of the argument are coming together to develop proposals shows how much progress has been made over the past few weeks.Her commitment to fixing the backstop drew praise from top Brexiteers, including Jacob Rees-Mogg who said: May I thank her for her very clear assurances that the withdrawal agreement text will be re-opened and that she will be considering what has been called the Malthouse compromise.Kevin BarronRonnie CampbellRosie CooperJim FitzpatrickCaroline FlintRoger GodsfStephen HepburnKate HoeyJohn MannDennis SkinnerLaura SmithGareth SnellGraham StringerAnother  Labour MPs apparently abstainedThe DUPs Nigel Dodds added: She can be assured of our support in trying to find a solution which avoids any hard border on the island of Ireland but also avoids any borders within the UK.A meeting of the hardline European Research Group agreed to back the Brady motion - vice-chairman Steve Baker said: “A vote for the Brady amendment is a vote to seethe PM can land a deal that will work.But arch-Brexiteer Mark Francois warned that Eurosceptics could vote the deal down all over againthe concessions on the backstop aren’t good enough.Mrs May fought fiercely against Yvette Coopers amendment, which would have given MPs the right to delay Brexit by up to nine monthsa deal isnt secured by the end of February.Labour chiefs decided to back the amendment after a meeting this morning - and the Peoples Vote campaign for a second referendum has publicly supported the move as the first step towards cancelling Brexit altogether.But it was defeated by a -vote margin after pro-EU ministers decided to back the Prime Minister.Mrs May vowed to bring a revised deal back to this house for a second meaningful vote as soon as we possibly can, adding thatthe deal hasnt passed by February  MPs will have another chance to declare their favoured solution then.And she mocked Labours shambolic Brexit policy, summarising it as, Lets have a few more votes in the future, possibly, maybe,we think it might be useful, at some stage.The PM concluded: If you want to leave with a deal you have to vote for it. If you want Brexit, you have to vote for Brexit.Before todays debate, Business Minister Richard Harrington issued an extraordinary public warning to Mrs May not to take Britain out of the EU without a deal.After a crushing defeat a fortnight ago, she has won a vote sending her back to Brussels with a firm mandate to demand more from the Brexit deal.The EU can stonewall all it likes. But every binding Remainer motion to impede or delay Brexit was defeated.And there is no point Brussels bleating about the Withdrawal Agreement being set in stone. We know it isn’t. Some EU figures have admitted it isn’t.They could tweak the text, time-limit the backstop or find another solution.They choose not to. And they will stick to that as long as they believe Parliament’s Remainers will ultimately strip the Government of its only negotiating leverage, the threat to just walk away.Remainers, some in Cabinet, may well yet do that. Nonetheless last night should sow doubt in Brussels’ minds.The victorious Brady amendment demands a vital, legally binding change to the Irish backstop before the PM’s deal can pass, just as The Sun called for.Even a dejected Corbyn has conceded he now needs to talk to Mrs May.The PM needs to know precisely what she’s demanding from Brussels — and we’re far from confident the EU will see reason. It is still more likely Brexit will be delayed, softened to a point that could tear the Tories apart or halted.But, after last night’s staggering turnaround, who knows He told the BBC: Many of us have been to see the Prime Minister and have told her the absolute catastrophe and disaster for jobs and the economy that No Deal would be.What she has asked us is that we give her another two weeks.Mr Harrington said he would quit as a ministerthe PM refused to give MPs another chance to rule out No Deal within a fortnight."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000460929495.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eu theresa may brexit jump out window ireland","story":"Simon Coveney snfed that the British government was being unreasonable for trying to change the hated Northern Ireland backstop - even though MPs have shown they simply wont agree to it.It comes as Brussels bosses piled in to tell the PM that her Brexit deal was NOT up for renegotiation - just seconds after MPs in the Commons told her she needed to change it.May was boosted after winning support for a new deal that means she will have to scrap the controversial backdrop.But Mr Coveney, who is the countrys foreign affairs minister, insisted today that it was extraordinary she was now going back to tear up her deal - and urged her to go for a soft Brexit instead.In an odd rant he claimed that she shouldnt be threatening to leave no deal.Thats like saying, in a negotiation, either you give me what I want or Im jumping out of the window, he told RTE Radio.The Irish Taoiseach is set to have a call with Theresa May later today to discuss the latest demands to go back to Brussels to replace the Northern Ireland backstop.Within seconds of the result last night, EU chiefs repeated their claim that it will be impossible to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.A coordinated statement from the European Council read: “Withdrawal agreement is and remains best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU.The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for re-negotiation.The remarks were echoed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who insisted the Brexit deal was “not renegotiable”.Mr Tusk’s called on the UK to “clary its intentions with respect to its next steps as soon as possible”.But in a testy exchange, Mr Raab, who quit over Mrs May’s Brexit deal last year,  told MPs on the Northern Ireland committee this morning that the reports were “factually incorrect.”He insisted that he had a “constructive”  meeting with Simon Coveney to discuss plans to make the Irish border work after Brexit.And that he kept details of the dinner confidential at his request.But later on details of the dinner emerged in the papers, and the Irish Taoiseach commented on them.“It was simply not what I discussed or what I proposed, Mr Raab said.Elsewhere he also accused the Irish government of taking a “trenchant line” on the backstop.And the strong positions taken by the Government mean it will be hard to find a “ladder to climb down”.Mr Raab  insisted that a way forward for the Irish border based on checks away from the frontiersneeded and “good will” from both sides.He pointed out that Michel Barnier himself was looking at ways to protect the integrity of the single market in the event that Britain left without a deal in March.“If it can be done in  months, it must be possible to be done in two years,” he argued.The Council chief vowed the bloc “will continue our preparations for all outcomes, including a no-deal scenario”.Earlier, in a private phone call, top Eurocrat Jean-Claude Juncker told Mrs May the deal cant be rewritten.And German MEP Manfred Weber, a close ally of Angela Merkel, claimed Gibraltar would be at riskBrexit talks restarted.He said: If there is now a unilateral attempt to reopen the agreement, the consequence will be that not just the backstop has to be renegotiated then the Gibraltar question, the question of how much money Britain has to pay for exiting, the question of citizens rights will have to be renegotiated.If we reopen, then everything will be reopened. And to be honest, I dont see much sense in that.Emmanuel Macron insisted the current deal is the best possible and said it was not renegotiable.EU bosses have repeatedly said the -page withdrawal agreement thrashed out in November cant be changed.They claim any tweaks must be confined to the attached political declaration, which is not legally binding.Today Mrs May told the Commons she would seek a signicant and legally binding change to the withdrawal agreement.The PM added: Negotiating such a change will not be easy - it will involve re-opening the withdrawal agreement, a move for which I know there is limited appetite among our European partners.But I believe that with a mandate from this house, I can secure such a change in advance of our departure from the EU.British officials believe the EU will agree to new talks to avoid a No Deal outcome which would harm the continent."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000465240904.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit compromise plan c theresa may backstop","story":"Leaders of the party’s two warring tribes have come together to call on the PM to accept a new plan and unite Conservatives.It replaces the unpopular Irish backstop with a dferent one, based on ‘max fac’ new technology to keep the border open instead of having to follow EU rules for years.At the same time, the Brexit transition will be extended to almost three years until December .But its major flaw is it is bitterly opposed by Brussels, after the EU bosses dismissed technological solutions to the border dilemma last year “magical thinking”.The PM told the Commons that the idea – dubbed Plan C – is “a serious proposal that we’re engaging with sincerely and positively”.But she refused to fully commit to adopting it, instead saying it was only one of three options that she is mulling over taking back to Brussels.In an extraordinary blow to the PM’s personal authority, it emerged that several mid-ranking ministers have been plotting for days behind her back to devise it.During a secret meeting with Mrs May on Monday, Brexiteer leader Steve Baker and ex-Education Secretary Remainer and Nicky Morgan implored her to accept it and propose the plan as the Government’s policy.But the PM refused, saying she needed more time to think it through.It was drawn up by Housing Minister Kit Malthouse, a Leaver, and became known as the ‘Malthouse Compromise’.He was helped by another minister, former Remain campaigner Robert Buckland, who is the Solicitor General.A second element of their plan is to negotiate a basic ‘no deal’ deal with the EUtherethere is still no agreement with Brussels by the time Britain leaves on March .Under their proposition for it, the UK would keep paying the EU the same annual contributions as now, of £bn a year, until December  to avoid a clf edge for businesses.But the EU also opposes that, as it means Brussels won’t get its full £bn orce cheque, and there is to Irish border backstop.The plan won the support of arch Euroscpetic Jacob Rees-Mogg and his hardline European Research Group of around  Tory MPs.It was also backed by the DUP, whose  MPs are propping up Mrs May’s minority government, in a clear sign it could win a Commons majority.It came just hours after Business Minister Richard Harrington gave Downing Street an ultimatum — saying he could quit unless the PM gave ‘rebels’ a say by the middle of February.He stormed: “If she is prepared to give that irrevocable undertaking - which means at the despatch box or a similar instrument - many of us feel ‘Well, OK for the sake of everything, we will give her two weeks’. But that is it.”Sources claimed both Mr Harrington and Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood were on the verge of resigning to ensure the ‘Cooper-Boles’ amendment to delay Brexit wins a majority.But Mr Ellwood ruled it out before the votes took place.Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd warned No two weeks ago that up to forty Ministers could quit unless they were allowed to back Cooper-Boles.She last week refused three times to rule out resigning.But the Chancellor intervened before the weekend to urge ‘Remain’ Ministers to realise the debate wasn’t ‘High Noon’ – and “there will be other opportunities for Parliament to express its view”.Mrs May said: “We will bring a revised deal back to this House for a second meaningful vote as soon as we possibly can.“If we have not brought a revised deal back to this House by Wednesday February  we will make a statement and again table an amendable motion for debate the next day.” The Ulster unionist party’s leader Arlene Foster said: “We believe it can uny a number of strands in the Brexit debate including the views of remainers and leavers.“It also gives a feasible alternative to the backstop proposed by the European Union.”But Brussels roundly rejected the Malthouse Compromise and insisted there can’t be a transition period unless Britain signs up to the backstop.EU Parliament Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt told The Sun: “The European Parliament won’t give its consent to a weakened Withdrawal Agreement.“The deal we have is a fair compromise and cannot be re-negotiated. If there is no Withdrawal Agreement, there is no transition.”Senior EU diplomats dismissed the plan as “nonsense” and said it had already been ruled out by their deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand on Monday.A top Brussels official said: “This is no plan at all. This is simply ditching the backstop in exchange for an extra year of transition period.”And the EU commission also poured cold water on the idea the bloc would green light a transition period without the UK accepting the whole deal.A spokesman said: “The transitional period is linked to the Withdrawal Agreement.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Mr Coveney said EU chiefs have explored alternatives endlessly and they have all come up short. He said the Brexit deal, which includes the backstop, wont be reopened because we are quite simply running out of road. The Deputy PM suggested Ireland is willing to sacrice trade because some things that are more important than economic relationships. And accusing the UK of threats, he declared: It’s like saying give me what I want or I’m jumping out the window.   And he said people were perplexed by MPs decision to send Mrs May off on a mission the EU says is impossible. We need a backstop or insurance mechanism based on legal certainty, and not just wishful thinking, Mr Coveney said in a speech in Dublin. We in Ireland are essentially being asked, as is the EU, to replace legal certainty... with a hope of something that is yet to be proven.   And in fact its worse than that. Because these hopes have already been tested in the negotiations and have come up short. In a brutal warning to Mrs May, he said: It is vitally important that politicians in Westminster understand the overwhelming wish across society in Northern Ireland not toto the borders and isions of the past. And anybody who allows that to happen will be judged harshly in history - and rightly so. And this government in Dublin is not going to allow it.  And I want to be crystal clear on that point. There are some things that are more important than economic relationships, and this is one of them. And that is why the resolve in Dublin, and the disappointment in Dublin, on the back of the vote last night which essentially signals a turning point of a British Prime Minister to this issue, has had such an impact here.

The Prime Minister is planning to beg the EU to rethink the controversial Irish border backstop within days. MPs backed a move to resurrect Mrs May’s deal - for now. But before she had even left British soil EU chief Donald Tusk had rejected her Plan B. “The withdrawal agreement is not open for negotiation,” he said. Even Mrs May conceded there was “limited appetite” for her Plan B in Brussels and warned her backbenchers that negotiating it would not be easy.   But her surrender to the eurosceptic wing of her party dramatically ramped up the threat of the UK crashing out of Europe without a deal. She backed a plan supported by Tory hardliners which could lead to the country leaving on damaging WTO terms, putting workers’ rights at risk. Mrs May supported an amendment tabled by Tory grandee Sir Graham Brady to replace the backstop with “alternative arrangements” to avoid a hard border. Downing Street believes that the plan would give the PM the “ammunition” she needs to go back to Brussels and demand change.   MPs backed the plan  to , majority , to rip up more than two years’ of gruelling negotiations and send her back to Brussels. It raised the astonishing spectre of the PM walking through the lobbies with Tory rebels to effectively vote against her own Brexit deal. Tory whips slapped each others’ backs after the result. But their main focus was on the  Tory MPs who had helped crush the PM’s own Brexit plan two weeks ago, fuelling a record -vote defeat. Last night,  of those Tory rebels backed the Brady plan in the hope it would strengthen the PMs negotiating hand. At the same time, MPs rejected plans to delay Brexit by at least three months to give more time to reach a deal.  They voted down an amendment by Labour ’s Yvette Cooper by  to , majority , that would have given them the power to step in and avoid no deal. Instead they backed an amendment by Tory Caroline Spelman to make clear they wanted crashing out taken off the table - but it was not legally binding. After the vote, Jeremy Corbyn revealed he was ready to meet Mrs May – after shunning talks for two weeks. The Labour leader said: “Tonight Parliament has voted to remove the immediate threat of crashing out without a deal on March . “After months of refusing to take the chaos of no deal off the table, the Prime Minister must now face the reality that no deal is not an option. “I will meet the Prime Minister and others from across Parliament to find a sensible Brexit solution that works for the whole country. “That solution should be based around Labour’s alternative plan of a customs union with a UK say, a strong single market relationship and a cast-iron guarantee on workers’ rights, consumer standards and environmental protections.” The dramatic Commons showdown brings back Mrs May’s deal from the grave - but it looked likely to be temporary. She told MPs backing the Brady plan would help her send an “emphatic message” to the EU that they had to compromise to get a Brexit deal through Parliament. “What I’m talking about is not a further exchange of letters but a signicant and legally binding change to the withdrawal agreement,” she said. Downing Street said the PM was proposing three potential changes to the Brexit deal. The “alternative proposals” including technical solutions, a time limit on the backstop or a unilateral exit cause. The hardline ERG group of Brexiteer MPs backed the Brady plan at the last minute after the PM gave a nod to further discussions on the “Malthouse compromise”. This could eventually see the UK leaving the EU with a ‘managed’ no deal - which critics warned would lead to a serious dilution of workers rights. In the Commons, Mrs May said the group had put forward “a serious proposal that we are engaging with sincerely and positively”. She added: “We will sit down and work through the proposal that has come forward.” But she still faces the threat of a rebellion from Remainer ministers to avoid no deal. Justice Secretary David Gauke was said to have warned cabinet colleagues that hardline Brexiteers would always demand more. He joked they would eventually ask: “Why can’t you persuade France to give back Calais ” Ministers including Welfare Secretary Amber Rudd, business minister Richard Harrington and defence minister Tobias Ellwood remained on No s watchlist. However, the PM’s promise of another vote by February  staved off the rebellion for now. One cabinet source told the Mirror: “They were reassured that Parliament would be able to step innecessary,there was no deal, to keep us from accidentally falling off a clf.” It means that MPs will now have to wait two weeks for their next chance to vote on Mrs May’s plan - kicking the can yet further down the road. But there was confusion in the Tory ranks as to what the Brady amendment would achieve. One former cabinet minister told the Mirror: “Dferent groups are interpreting it in dferent ways.   “Some see it as the route to a World Trade Organisation exit. Others just a few tweaks to her deal. It’s a stitch up for tonight but means nothing.” Yet before MPs had even voted Mrs May was preparing her MPs for disappointment. It comes just weeks after she warned that reopening talks was impossible and that any changes had to lead to “negotiable” outcomes. Mr Tusk said the Northern Ireland backstop was not up for negotiation, but welcomed Parliament’s desire to avoid a no deal scenario. “We continue to urge the UK government to clary its intentions with respect to its next steps as soon as possible,” he said. “The Withdrawal Agreement is and remains the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. “The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for renegotiation.” Speaking in Cyprus moments before MPs voted, French president Emmanuel Macron added: “It is not renegotiable.” ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\""},{"url":null,"title":"brexit vote summary 7 key","story":"NewsBrexit vote summary:  key moments on amendments night and what they meanTheresa May is now stronger and ready to fight the EU - but it could all fall down around her ears.

But it could all fall down around her ears within days. So what actually happened on Tuesday night  MPs held a string of House of Commons votes on what the Prime Minister should do next, two weeks after her deal suffered a record -vote defeat. And she did better than expected. MPs blocked a bid to delay Brexit beyond  March - and instead backed her plan to re-open talks with the EU on the -page Brexit deal, including the Irish backstop. However, the rare glimmer of hope could soon flicker out because within minutes, the EU said the deal is NOT up for renegotiation. There is also more woe for her further down the track, because MPs rejected the prospect of a No Deal Brexit. It all means that, with just  days left until we leave the EU, talks are still deadlocked. The deadlocks just moved from London to Brussels. Here is a simple summary of the  key moments from tonight, and what they mean.  MPs have finally agreed on something about Brexit. Two weeks after Theresa Mays deal suffered an all-time record defeat, they rallied round an idea. MPs voted - for an amendment by Tory Sir Graham Brady which says theyll accept the deal - IF the Prime Minister rewrites it to change the Irish backstop. And crucially, she was backed by  of the  Tory rebels who defeated her last time. That suggests thatshe gets what she wants - a BIG- she could win a final meaningful vote in two weeks time. As recently as Monday, top Tory Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg were refusing to back the Brady amendment. But Mrs May won them round by promising solid legal changes, and looking at alternative proposals, a time limit and a unilateral exit clause. She told MPs: There is limited appetite for such a change in the EU and negotiating it will not be easy. But in contrast to a fortnight ago this House has made it clear what it needs to approve a withdrawal agreement.”   EU chiefs slapped down the vote less than  minutes after it happened. EU Council President Donald Tusk said - again - that he WONT reopen talks on the -page Brexit deal. Instead hes only offering to talk about the much smaller political declaration, which doesnt include the backstop. That leaves talks just as deadlocked as before. The deadlocks just moved from London to Brussels. An EU spokesman said: The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement. And the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for re-negotiation. If Brussels doesnt blink, peace in Westminster looks short-lived. And we could face a revolt against Theresa May all over again February . In a major but only symbolic move, MPs ordered Theresa May to reject a no deal Brexit. The amendment, which was by Tory MP Caroline Spelman and Labours Jack Dromey, passed by just eight votes.  voted to back the amendment, and  voted against. It doesnt require the government to do anything legally but it shows clearly the feeling of the Commons. And it lays down a marker for what happens nextTheresa May doesnt have any success with the EU. When she comes back to MPs on February , that feeling against a No Deal Brexit could turn into action.  Paradoxically, despite voting to reject No Deal, MPs also blocked a move that could have prevented it. The House of Commons rejected an amendment by Labour MP Yvette Cooper,  votes to , to extend the  March date of leaving the EUthere was no progress by February . The shock -vote majority was a crushing disappointment for Remainers who widely expected to block a damaging No Deal. So what do the two conflicting results mean Basically, MPs agree there should not be a No Deal Brexit. But they cant decide on how to block it.  The pound fell after MPs defeated a bid to delay Brexit. Sterling fell .% to the days low of .. It shows markets are still jittery about the prospect of a No Deal Brexit, which with  days to go, remains very, very real.  Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to meet Theresa May to try and break the Brexit deadlock. The Labour leader repeatedly refused to meet the Prime Minister until she ruled out no deal Brexit . But after Parliament voted to reject no deal, Mr Corbyn said he would meet with the PM - even though the vote was only symbolic. “I will meet the prime minister and others from across Parliament to find a sensible Brexit solution that works for the whole country, he said. “That solution should be based around Labour’s alternative plan of a customs union with a U.K. say, a strong single market relationship and a cast iron guarantee on workers’ rights, consumer standards and environmental protections.”  Theresa May had been expected to suffer a defeat at the hands of Tory rebels. But she was left more secure, partly because she was backed by Labour ones. For example,  Labour MPs backed the Brady amendment. If theyve voted against, it would have still passed but by just a whisker. Meanwhile  Tory Remainers including Anna Soubry and Kenneth Clarke backed the plan by Yvette Cooper to delay Brexit. But  Labour MPs balanced them out by opposing Coopers plan - the majority of whom represent Leave-voting consituencies including Caroline Flint and Laura Smith as well as long term Brexiteers Ronnie Campbell and Kate Hoey. A further  Labour MPs abstained including Ruth Smeeth, Melanie Onn and Gloria De Piero who represent Leave-voting seats.  The message from tonight is weve had a string of contradictory messages - and no certain future for Brexit. Theresa May could still delay the date of Brexit in future, or be forced to, because MPs have made clear they dont want No Deal. Itll all turn against her, at least initially, when she has talks in Brussels. And it could all turn against her in Parliament tooshe doesnt get what she wanted. The next vote is on around February .

But  days before Brexit, the pair were as ided as ever in a furious exchange at Prime Ministers Questions. Mrs May refused to budge on her red lines and accept Mr Corbyns demand for a customs union with the EU. Meanwhile Mr Corbyn said it was very clear any deal will need exactly the customs union shes rejected. Despite supposedly uniting to find the way forward, the pair dug in their heels even deeper in todays clash. The PM mocked her Labour rival and Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry for not listening to her answers. And she claimed he didnt have a coherent Brexit plan of his own. Mrs May is heading back to the EU to reopen talks on her -page Brexit deal, including the Irish backstop.But the EU have already slapped down that request by saying the deal is not up for negotiation. Labours leader demanded today: Which of her red lines are going to change  And the PM would not say. Mrs May is demanding the Irish backstop, which could lock the UK in EU customs rules, is replaced with alternative arrangements. She claimed these arrangements could include mutual recognition of trusted trader schemes. But Mr Corbyn retorted: None of that was very clear to me, I dont know about anyone .  Mrs May also said she was seeking a unilateral exit mechanism or a time limit on the backstop - despite the EU flatly rejecting both ideas.And she refused to rule out a No Deal Brexit - despite MPs voting to reject the prospect of one last night. She said: Last night the House did vote to reject no deal - but that cannot be the end of the story. You cant just vote to reject no deal, you have to vote for a deal otherwise you leave with no deal.  The PM accused Jeremy Corbyn of not having a coherent policy - questioning whether his desire for a strong single market relationship would mean accepting EU blocks on state aid. Mr Corbyn said she had possibly, temporarily united the ided Tories - but added: Shes got to move on from the red lines she put down in the first place. Changes to the backstop alone will not be sufficient.  Businesses and trade unions are very clear that any solution must involve a customs union and the strongest possible relationship with the single market. But the Prime Minister pointed out MPs had voted to approve her deal - IF she replaces the backstop. He put forward a proposal last night... and his proposal was rejected by this House, she raged. He has no plan for Brexit, no good plan for our economy, and no plan for our country.Mr Corbyn will sit down with Theresa May for talks this afternoon in a bid to secure Labour demands on Brexit .The Labour leader, who boycotted earlier talks, said he was ready to discuss a “sensible” approach to Brexit after MPs voted to rule out no deal.  But the Prime Minister’s hopes of securing concessions from Brussels in time to avoid crashing out on March  appeared remote. EU chiefs underlined their opposition to reopening the withdrawal agreement. On Tuesday night MPs backed a plan, the Brady amendment, which forces the PM toto Brussels to try to negotiate “alternative arrangements” to the controversial Irish border backstop. She is expected to jet out to Brussels later this week. But her Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, was unable to say what the “alternative” involved after being asked five times. “That’s what we’re exploring. There are a number of options,” he said.  And with just  days to go until Brexit Day he refused to “get into the technicalities” of how the plan would work. Despite last night’s victory the PM has never appeared more boxed-in. Fears mounted over whether the Brexiteers were planning to deliberately run down the clock - so that the UK would crash out without a deal. With MPs wondering who would blink first, the EU remained staunchly opposed to re-opening the orce deal. The head of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, said the other EU states were standing firm. “The  governments remain united over Brexit. I hope we can avoid a hard Brexit. It is dficult to imagine we can renegotiate a deal that has been already approved by EU member states.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how mp vote delaying brexit","story":"NewsHow did my MP vote on delaying Brexit  Search full results as  Labour MPs help block key amendmentMPs - including  from Labour - voted down an amendment by Labours Yvette Cooper that called for the  March Brexit date to be axedShareByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsThe votes largely split on party lines \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Last night, MPs voted down a bid by Labours Yvette Cooper to delay the  March date of Brexit.There was a wide expectation that the plan, officially backed by Labour and opposed by the Tories, would pass.But in a key result that strengthened Theresa May politically, it fell  to  - a -vote majority.

Nothing better illustrates her humiliating status of impotent follower than the cowed Prime Minister pretending she’d be able to rewrite swtly a draft deal she personally negotiated with our European neighbours over nearly two months. This is phantom politics from a figure devalued faster than the pound when she’s ignored firm replies of no. non, nein and nee. We learned May’s word is a worthless plastic promise with this about her survival, not Britain’s.   Commons votes against leaving Europe with no deal and seeking vague “alternative arrangements” mean she’s going to Brussels and Jeremy Corbyn to Downing Street where he’ll find May’s door is open and her mind closed. She lives to die another day and playing Brexit Blackmail hopes enough MPs will eventually decide a iant of her bad deal’s better than no deal. Yet Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass with its Mad Hatter, Humpty Dumpty and Alice swallowed by a rabbit hole was believable compared with the humiliating tale of Twisting Theresa’s psychedelic contortions. Brexit delayed is likelier than ever and should May miss her  March deadline, the PM doesn’t need to look beyond Downing Street for somebody to blame. Should Britain accidentally crash out in a job destroying, income-wrecking catastrophic no deal, her fingerprints will be on the national disaster.   Putting party before country, shackling herself to Tory headbangers and revolting Northern Ireland mercenaries, will end in tears. Dire Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay’s embarrassing inability to explain what would replace the Northern Ireland so-called backstop to avoid a hard border was the vacuity of a hollow strategy. Brexit’s an expensive, destructive addition to Made in Britain scandals including the criminal gulf between poverty pay and Fat Cat aice and poorly funded schools and hospitals starved by Tory austerity. Tellingly during yesterday’s rehearsed speeches in Parliament we discovered blood donations in Kent are another victim of the uncertainty while the Conservatives used the debate as a smokescreen to sneak out fresh council cuts.

And by and large he did. He began with a simple question. Would the Prime Minister set out the ‘alternative arrangements’ to the backstop she is seeking to negotiate  “Absolutely,” Theresa May replied and then spent several sentences doing the complete opposite. She referenced the Malthouse compromise and nodded to Sir Graham Brady’s amendment and waffled about a possible technical change but the one thing she consciously avoided doing in her long and rambling answer was explain what she wanted to achieve in the talks. Mr Corbyn then did what he rarely does, he made a joke.  “None of that was very clear to me and I doubt it was to anybody ,” he deadpanned. The Labour leader valiantly tried asking Mrs May which of her red lines she was willing to change in order to secure a deal. He then asked, somewhat mischievously, what technological advances did she expect to make in the next  days that could prevent a hard border in Ireland. Mrs May, who appeared oblivious to what had happened in the chamber last night, then accused Labour of not having a clear position on Brexit. There may be some truth in this but it was a bit rich from a leader whose strategy on Brexit was to spend two years negotiating a deal and then whip her own MPs to vote against it. The Prime Minister repeated the calumny by claiming her government had “won” last night’s vote on Brexit.  Technically, this is correct in terms of the votes passed but it is a strange victory which requires you to abandon everything you had achieved in the last  months and had previously insisted was the only deal on the table. Having run out of non answers the Prime Minister used her final response to list her government’s achievements - apparently more money is going to councils which will surprise anyone working in local government - before accusing Labour of having no plan for the economy. Some will conclude that whatever plan Labour has it can hardly be worse than the no deal with which this government continues to flirt.

Amber Peat was found sitting in the library, filled with worry, on one occasion after losing the belt from her coat, the hearing was told. Teacher Joanne Holland described how she had to call the youngsters mum because she was scared of going home and getting told off. During the phone conversation, Mrs Holland assured Ambers mother: We will find it, Nottinghamshire Coroners Court heard this week. She was worried about going home because she had lost the belt off her coat, the teacher told the court, according to the BBC. She basically said she was scared she was going to get told off. I had to phone home and tell mum, It really is fine, we will find it.   The encounter happened at the end of the school day, it was said. Amber was found hanged in  three days after she went missing from her home, following a row with her mum over household chores. The court has heard the argument was about cleaning a cool box, which was used to store food on a recent family holiday in Cornwall, where the youngster had hatched plans to run away with her cousin. Ambers mother Kelly Peat heard the front door slam shut shortly after the dispute at around .pm on May , , at the home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, the inquest had been told. A passer-by saw somebody of Ambers description enter a hedgerow area near the address around  minutes later, it was said.  Up to  police staff were involved in the search for the missing youngster, before her body was tragically recovered on June . Speaking at the inquest, Mrs Holland, an ex-form tutor of Amber, described how the schoolgirl often tried to get attention. The teacher said she felt this could be because the student didnt get as much attention at home as would be considered normal. She recalled the youngsters habit of leaving an item behind after form time, so she couldto the classroom to retrieve it. She said she liked walking into a room filled with older students. Obviously the older students, because she was small and cute, were like, aww, look at Amber and she would love that, said Mrs Holland.  The teacher had been Ambers form tutor at Tibshelf Community School, but the pupil left the school before the end of her first year. Instead, she moved to Queen Elizabeth School in Mansfield . Another teacher has told the inquest that she didnt want to move. Before she vanished from her home before her death, the teenager had got into trouble for drinking Cherryade without permission. She had a history of running away, and Mrs Peat only called police to report her missing at .am on May , the inquest has heard. Detective Constable Tina Gilfoyle, of Nottinghamshire Police, said the mum and Ambers stepfather, Danny Peat, had been to Tesco and had tea while the youngster was missing.   Providing background of the the teenagers disappearance, Ms Gilfoyle said the family had moved  times in Ambers letime. The hearing has been told there was no evidence of physical neglect and no sign Amber was malnourished at the time of her death.

Alongside the first two options were images of a man and a woman giving the thumbs up sign.However next to the word transgender there was a cartoon of a person removing a wig from their head.  Many people who saw the image have said they found it offensive, while others have accused Essex Council of being transphobic.Former Liberal Democrat representative, Zoe OConnell, told Essex Live: This is another example of how unaware some authorities are.The whole thing is isulting. The text in the question is just wrong. Transgender is not a gender on its own - many trans people identy as either male or female.   The imagery is even worse which shows someone removing a wig, its conveying how transgender is not authentic, which is just wrong. Zoe added: People will feel like Essex County Council dont understand them. The council need to recty the question. Childrens book author Liz Miles, , was also shocked by the image. People are very upset and shocked that this appalling image is part of the survey, she said. I think its so offensive.   I was absolutely amazed, it looked like someone was either scratching their head or they were pulling a wig off. The other images looked very happy and had their thumbs up. Are they saying transgender people are sad or confused  I think its transphobic and really shows a lack of understanding. Essex County Council have since apologised for the image causing offence.  A spokesperson said: We are aware of a Twitter post that raises concerns about an image on our easy read version of the Libraries Consultation document.Firstly we would like to reassure those concerned that the image was specically chosen to help communicated with people with learning disabilities. It was supplied by an organisation called Inspired Services, who work with people with learning disabilities to produce Valuing People Clipart, which is used by the Government and NHS England for easy read publications. However we are sorry for any offence the image has caused and will now consider whether this image is used in the future.

Despite being just ft ins tall, Alfie Williams won his first fight in just  seconds and has since come out triumphant in  out of  bouts.The fearsome youngster, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs, often squares up to opponents much older than him and is determined to one day become a world champion MMA fighter like his hero Conor McGregor .Proud dad Chris Williams said that the sport has transformed his son from an “obnoxious little loudmouth to a disciplined and focused young man.  And his trainer Ross Pointon said he knows plenty of grown adults who wouldnt dare take on the youngster in the cage. Construction worker Chris said: Alfie absolutely loves cage fighting. He hates bullying and always stands up for his mates. If it came to it he could take a good hit and give a good hit. He can get me in a head lock very easily. But the sport teaches him respect, so I know hed only do that as a last resort. Hes a very active child but the sport has bought a huge amount of discipline to him. Chris said Alfie has always been a competitive and sporty child who first started kick boxing aged just four.  Moving on to Taekwondo at age six, Alfie became a world champion in the martial art but he quickly tired of the sport. In April , Alfie started to attend training sessions at Gladiator MMA Gym in Stoke-on-Trent, run by his now-mentor and trainer, Ross, a former MMA champion. Ross, , said: Alfie came to me almost a year ago. Hes become so much more outgoing. Hes become so much braver, he loves the sport and hes so passionate about it. Hes such a strong young man, I have so much respect for him and all the children who walk towards that cage. I call him big man because it takes so much courage. I know grown men who wouldnt dare do what Alfie does. He comes here after school five times a week and is here for almost two hours at a time. Hes become more focused, fitter, stronger and more confident. We dont just teach him how to fight but also le skills.  After just four months of training, Alfie took part in his first MMA fight in June last year - and incredibly, won the bout in just  seconds. And Chris said despite its reputation, the sport has completely transformed his mini McGregor - and has hit out at accusations hes a bad dad for letting him fight. Chris said: He was a bit mischievous but since hes been taking part in the sport his teachers have said he seems a lot more focused and determined and knows what he wants from le. It was incredible to see, he was so focused and disciplined. It can be quite time consuming but he loves it. I enjoy watching him and seeing how well he does.  He added: ”I get nervous when I watch him in the ring but its enjoyable and always amazing to see him once hes won medals. Theres a lot of sportsmanship and respect in the cage. Youll fight like hell then shake each other by the hand. He enjoys the sport and learns so much from it. I take him training and to all his competitions. At the end of the day its not about me, its about him. Its what we wants from le so Ill help him all the way. Ross has taught him discipline and self-respect but also respect to other people. Alfie seems a lot more together than most kids his age.

In just three weeks, Curtis Kelly has gained more than , followers on his @Cleanwithme Instagram account and counts the clean queen herself Mrs Hinch among his fans. He was inspired by the phenomenon Sophie Hinchclfe, who has .million followers, has appeared on This Morning and is releasing her own book, Hinch Yourself Happy, in April. And he might soon be giving the Essex hairdresser a run for her money with his before and after photo transformations. Curtis, who lives with is mum in Newtownards, Northern Ireland, “never ever expected” his mopping, scrubbing and hoovering stories would be such an inspiration to others, some who have credited him for helping them with depression.  The care worker told Belfast Live : “I broke my spine nine weeks ago and I thought to myself, ‘I’ll start an Instagram and it’ll just be something to do when I’m off work’. “I was putting up some Christmas lights and fell off a ladder straight on to the concrete. It was terrible. “When I was taken to AE in a neck brace, there was a question as to whether I would walk again as they were doing nerve tests and I couldn’t feel.” Thankfully, his feeling ed in a “couple of hours”.   “I am incredibly grateful and a lucky person to be able to come back from an injury like that,” he added. “I fractured three vertebrae in my back, which was agony.” Curtis was then “laid up for four weeks” and wasn’t allowed to drive. “When I was back up on my feet that’s when the Instagram came because I was bored on my own every day,” he said. “I just needed something.”   But Curtis said he never expected his page to take off, never mind inspire others facing their own troubles. He said: “It’s just exploded out of nowhere. “It’s a massive shock. It was a wee bit of fun, but it’s just escalated. “ Mrs Hinch follows my page and she messages me. I have always loved cleaning and when I saw her making her Instagram account, I thought ‘why not ’ to give me something to do.  “My Instagram account is to inspire and help people and show them my wee cleaning tips and the hacks that I do. “My mum tells me that from no age I was running about the house with my little cleaning trolly cleaning up behind people,” said Curtis. “It’s just something I have always been into and I take a lot of pride in having a clean house.” But he said “it came as a bit of a surprise” when people started reaching out to him.   “I thought people might watch and have a laugh at me cleaning as I dance about the house like a mad man,” he added. “I just didn’t think I’d become such an inspiration to people. I never ever expected that and I wouldn’t change it for the world. “I have had so many messages daily. There was one woman who told me she was depressed when her partner died years ago and she hadn’t touched his clothes. “I did a video where I cleared my wardrobe and sort of keeping sentimental things, but I put them in boxes somewhere.   “She said ‘I’m glad you did that, because it gave me the push I needed’. “It’s amazing getting messages from people saying I help them fight anxiety and depression, that, for me, makes it so worth it. While his videos are all about leaving making sure the house he shares with his mother is gleaming, they have also helped a Ballybeen woman with depression and anxiety, to get out of bed in the mornings.   The woman, who did not want to be named, said: “He is just amazing. “I live on my own and some days with my depression and social anxiety I can’t even get out the door or even get out of bed. But when I switch on my Instagram, I watch him and Mrs Hinch and they are just enough for me to just get up out of bed and do even the tiniest wee thing like making my bed and sitting in the living room. “They can inspire me to do that. They just make me feel that little bit more human.”   Meanwhile, Curtis has revealed his number one cleaning tip. Get music on when you’re cleaning, he said. “I stick the music on and dance about the house and do each room one at a time. Just have fun with it. It’s not the funnest thing to do and a lot of people don’t enjoy it like I do. “But when you do it one room at a time and get your favourite play list or artist on, it just makes it so much easier.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle steps out matching","story":"NewsMeghan Markle wears £, outfit at National Theatre to take over special role from QueenThe Duchess of Sussex was announced as patron of the institution earlier this month, a role Her Majesty held for almost five decadesShareCommentsByAmber Hicks:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video meghan-leaves-national-theatre-after-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA heavily-pregnant Meghan Markle dipped her toe back into the world of performing arts today during a visit to the National Theatre . The -year-old Duchess of Sussex looked stunning as she stepped out in a pound, nude tailored blazer with matching pound, v-neck mini dress by designer Brandon Maxwell. She teamed the outfit with her pound. Carolina Herrera clutch, which she debuted at Trooping the Colour last year, and her classic pound Aquazzura Matilde heels that she wore for her engagement announcement. The smiling Duchess also wore her hair in a chic up-do for her first visit to the theatre since taking over as patron from the Queen. A chorus of cheers were heard from fans gathered outside to catch a glimpse of the mum-to-be as she stepped out the car.  She was greeted by Rufus Norris, director of the National Theatre, who held a private meeting with her in December. She then met with carpenters, metalworkers and other craftsman preparing the sets. It was announced earlier this month that the former actress was succeeding the Queen as the organisations patron, a role Her Majesty held for almost five decades. Today, the VIP visitor took part in a workshop, met current and former apprentices, and watched a performance inspired by War Horse by pupils from Edith Neville Primary School in Camden, created to mark the centenary of Armistice Day.  The visit will no doubt have brought back memories of the career that thrust Meghan into the spotlight - and helped her bag her prince. She spent a decade working as an actress in television, where she was best known for her role in the hit US legal drama series Suits, playing paralegal-turned-lawyer Rachel Zane. She also has a theatre background having studied theatre and international relations at Northwestern University, Illinois, and volunteered at a performing arts after-school programme for children in underprivileged school districts in Los Angeles. And as we previously reported , Meghans father Thomas Markle made numerous sacrices so she could fulfil her dream of becoming a performer. He is the person who believed in this grand dream of mine well before I could even see it as a possibility, she previously said   Thomas also worked as a lighting director on two television shows. It was while accompanying her father, that a young Meghan got a taste of what le was like to be an actress. She was surrounded by famous actors, their glam teams, multi-million dollar budgets, and crew lunches that always included filet mignon and enough sweets to make you think you were at Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. As she went from audition to audition trying to make it as an actress, it was Thomas who put gas in her car so she could get to them. Suits was her big break and she described it as stealing her heart and being the Goldilocks of my acting career – where finally I was just right.. Her patronage with the National Theatre is a natural fit as she is a strong believer in using the arts to bring people from dferent backgrounds and communities together.  The theatre accidentally announced Meghans patronage in an online gaffe - a day before Kensington Palace was set to confirm it. It said in a statement: The National Theatre is honoured to announce thatHer Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussexhas become its Royal Patron. The patronage reflects Her Royal Highness’s belief in using the arts to bring people from dferent backgrounds and communities together. Her Majesty The Queen has passed on the Royal Patronage to The Duchess of Sussex having held the role for the last  years and has been associated with the organisation since its earliest days at the Old Vic in the s.   The Duchess has spent decades championing the arts and feels that she can use her position to focus attention on and make a particular dference to the sector. Meanwhile, Prince Harry in his role of Commonwealth Youth Ambassador, met young people from across the Commonwealth at a roundtable discussion at Lancaster House this morning. The Duke heard from young people about the issues that are key to them in the run up to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting  . He also gave a speech and said: I can honestly say I feel more passionate than ever about the huge opportunity we have here. To empower young people across the Commonwealth, you who are here in this room today, and the millions around the world who are part of this global collective of change makers. Tomorrow Meghan will also be visiting the Association of Commonwealth Universities tohear more about how it is working to promote inclusion and access to education for underrepresented groups. While on Friday, the Duchess and Prince Harry are heading to Bristol where they will visit the Bristol Old Vic theatre.

And she discovered that you really do have more fun as a brunette rather than a blonde when the number of approaches halved after she changed her profile picture to one where her hair had a golden colour.   Hayley, a model from Peterborough, said: I spent six months learning everything there is to know about how subtle changes to your profile picture and personality details can make a huge dference to the type of man you attract. If you want to have sex, it sounds obvious but you need to be make clear in your pictures that you are out for a good time. So accentuate the cleavage, smile and look like you are up for a laugh. You should also use some pictures of you when you were younger to hide your real age - everyone is doing that online. If you want someone rich, blonde is definitely the way to go - that look attracted lots of sugar daddies who wanted to wine and dine me before taking me to bed.   The most genuine men came forward when I was most like the real me - either showing my age in a revealing dress while out on the town or as a keep fit fanatic in my gym gear. I also meet some lovely men when I wore glasses because they thought I was a bit of an intellectual. The two looks which really bombed were when I wore glasses and when I went completely without make-up as a total slob. I also tried the businesswoman look in a smart suit but all the guys I met were total bores.  Hayley went on all the dates over six months through IllicitEncounters, a dating site for married people. She added: It was a great experiment but I prefer being me. I wont have as much as sex as I can do with some of the flirty pictures of me but I will meet a better class of men. IllicitEncounters spokesman Christian Grant said: Hayley is typical of the women on the site who tend to be in their s and are looking for no-strings attached fun with men who have a good level of income. Heres which looks worked best according to Hayley:. Best for sex - the busty brunette -  approaches  Hayley said: This was far the best look for creating a buzz and getting lots of attention. Sadly a lot of men were only interested in one thing and made absolutely clear that they expected sex on the first date after we got chatting online. I tended to get attention from younger men who were keen to exchange sexy pictures. I did date three of the men who contacted me with this profile and we had a lot of fun but it didnt go anywhere.. Best for a rich sugar daddy - bubbly, party-loving blonde -  approaches  Hayley said: The key dference when I used a picture from a few years ago with me as a blonde was that the men who came on to me were older and richer. Obviously they were married because this was IllicitEncounters - they had made their money and were looking for a fun-loving bit on the side. They loved the fact that I was holding a wine glass and gave the impression I was a party girl. I dated two men who contacted me with this profile picture. One was lovely and we had a great weekend together in Marbella staying in a five star hotel. He was in his s and he was a bit old for me but a fantastic lover nevertheless.. Best for love - Hayley as herself -  approaches  Hayley said: I am naturally a fun-loving brunette who is proud of my figure and loves my surgically enhanced boobs. I spent pound, on a boob op, going up from B to FF. I am fed up with dating skint pretty boys. I like enjoying the high le and sharing some intelligent conversations with older men. I found the men were a little more genuine when I went on as myself - they could see there was nothing contrived about my profile. I used fullpictures of myself rather than one that just focused on my bust and they showed my real age more clearly. I got fewer younger men coming on to me than I did with the cleavage pictures and more men who were interested in a proper relationship.. Best for companionship - the gym bunny -  approaches   Hayley said: I am happiest when I am in the gym and I found a few kindred spirits when I used some work-out pictures of myself on my profile. I had men wanting to meet up at the gym rather than a bar or a restaurant which was a nice change. I met some great guys but I was conscious that I was not making enough of my feminine side.. Best for boredom - Hayley in a smart business suit -  approaches Hayley said: It is not really me but I straightened my hair flat, wore a smart business suit and had the persona of a successful businesswoman. I thought it might get me a classier type of guy but it just attracted a bunch of bores. This definitely didnt work.. Best for nice guys - Hayley wearing spectacles -  approaches  Hayley said: If you are dating online, ditch the specs - that is my advice. I was worried I would not get any approaches at all but four men came on to me and they were all absolutely lovely. The spectacles created a whole new persona for me and that was reflected in the responses. The men were much more polite but sadly none of them had a lot of money.. Best for a complete blow-out - Hayley as a slacker without make-up - no approaches  Hayley said: If you are dating online, get out the slap - no one want to see you when you are not looking your best. I thought men might like the fact that I didnt care about my appearance but who wants to date a slob with spots  You can really enhance your profile picture with the right make-up and hairstyle.

On occasion the Ossan have been know to help clients move their furniture and even pretended to be someones boyfriend.Speaking about his business, Nishimoto told The Japanese Times that he was overwhelmed by the response it had. He said: A lot of people need advice on their lives, their careers and their relationships. Im not a counsellor, but I thought my experience might help someone out there.

But within the walls of the palaces the Royal Family have nicknames for each other - and some of them are rather odd. Kate calls hubby William Baldy, while he refers to her as the Duchess of Dolittle , which could be a reference to reports the Queen was worried about her lack of career when they started dating.The Queen has a number of nicknames, including Gary , Lilibetand the young royals call her Gan-Gan. Many have asked why the royals, known for their formality and proper ways, opt for such odd nicknames but it turns out there might be a few interesting reasons why. One source told the Sun : The royals are not very good at communicating with one another so this is one way around it. Nicknames are a way of taking the family tension out of things.“They can also be a rather childlike family. They love to play games and they give each other silly presents. I think its because they have to be so earnest in their public lives. Royals have always played in private.   Its done with affection usually and there are grains of truth about what one feels about another. Another source said the nicknames also provide a security advantage, as it means they can identy each other without making certain information public.

People with this preference may have strong feelings of attraction, love and commitment to certain items or structures of their fixation.

Jesus is a Malteser, Georgia tastes like a big fat ball of wool and Grace is a soft turnip in a pot of vegetable soup. And while Millicent is a bowl of lightly-browned mince, Lucy tastes like a bag of strawberry laces and Ross resembles a Greggs sausage roll. Julie McDowall has an unusual condition called synesthesia which means her sensory systems are more entwined than normal. Part of the affliction means the inidual can join objects such as letters, shapes, numbers or peoples names with a sensory perception like smell, colour or flavour. On Sunday evening, the Glasgow journalist posted: I have synethesia which means I can taste words. Ask me what your name tastes like. Scroll down for more examples...  The tweet subsequently went viral with thousands of Twitter users asking what she associated with their name, Plymouth Live reports. Ms McDowall later tweeted she had received an excess of six million notications over a -hour period and would not be able to sort through the backlog of monikers. In order to screen the requests, she introduced a Paypal filter. Users were invited to donate to her weekly nuclear war podcast, The Atomic Hobo, in exchange for the sampling of three names. The donation amount is unspecied and presumably can be as large or a small as you like. Erin is a cola-flavoured boiled sweet which has been dusted in cocoa powder, reads one tweet. She continues to state that Hannah tastes like an off banana, Amy is a packet of raw bacon strips and Shane tastes like furniture polish.  Adrian is an Aero bar, Charlotte a raspberry lolly and Leah is thick, gloopy custard. Rebecca is shortbread and Jamie is rain on a window pain. And Meghan Markle is particularly off the wall, tasting like plain broken Hula Hoops and an itchy scab respectively. Kate Middleton, on the other hand, is a hearty slice of cake. Donald is a rubber duck, sliced in two and dipped in vinegar. Louise is soft toffee and Benjamin is a combination of ginger and the clear plastic handle of a screwdriver. Paul tastes like the fondant inside a Creme Egg and Scott is a Rich Tea biscuit. William and Julie are both watering eyeballs.  Rob and Robert are both heads. Rob is a robbers head. He is wearing a balaclava andyou bite his head you see it is made full of chocolate. Robert is a gnomes head and biting it shows it is full of strawberry fondant. Unfortunately for Duncan, he is a burp. And Joe is a leathery, chunky button on an old mans cardigan.

The perceptual phenomena has been traced back as far as the th century where it is reported a blind man experienced the colour scarlet when he heard the sound of a trumpet.

She said: “I really enjoy my swimming and I come to the pool three times a week. “It will be tough to complete all these s and I’ve just started out – but I’m enjoying it so far.” BBS is a rare genetic disorder with symptoms including sight loss, obesity and reduced kidney . Like many other sufferers, Fern was also born with extra digits. The condition affects just one in , people across the world.   Sister Leigh, , said: “We’re all incredible proud of Fern and what she’s trying to achieve. “She was diagnosed with BBS at a very young age and her condition, particularly her sight, has deteriorated through time. “But she is never one to complain so this is typical of her attitude – she’s just determined to get out there and do something worthwhile.” Staff at Prestwick and Troon pools are helping encourage Fern during her bid, as she tackles up to  s at a time during each session. And the former Mainholm Academy pupil hopes to complete the marathon water trip while stacking up the cash for BBS UK. The charity provides support for those living with the condition and their carers. Leigh added: “It would be niceFern’s story going public could help with her fundraising effort. “She has her small group of friends and carers but it would mean the world to her to get support from further afield and raise as much as she can.” •To donate visit https:www.justgiving fundraising fern-walker "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game.

Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

A senior source said: “The UK Government’s contribution to the Ayrshire Growth Deal will be in the region of pound million. “It’s clear from the growth deal process that a lot of very exciting projects have been put forward. We are confident the deal can deliver a massive boost to the local economy.” The Ayrshire Growth Deal will provide signicant investment in the key sectors of aerospace and space at Prestwick, le sciences, manufacturing and tourism. It has been talked about for years as a poundm fund but the Scottish Government and three Ayrshire councils have all failed to reveal their financial input. The aim is to make key investments that will grow the economy and lead to , new jobs.  To do that the poundm public sector finance will have to trigger poundbillion of private investment. It is widely accepted Ayrshire has missed out on big investment deals as it has three councils scrapping for superiority, rather than a single strategic voice. Growth money is expected to be spent on luring a medicines manufacturing innovation centre, developing brownfield sites for industry, improving the Bellfield Interchange, upgrading digital infrastructure and free port status at Prestwick , the Port of Ayr and Falkland Rail Yard in Ayr and a renewable energy hub in Cumnock. It is expected the signing of heads of terms - the stage when all the ious partners get together and announce which projects will receive funding - will be reached within several months. All seven of Scotland’s cities are now covered by the deals and Ayrshire is in the first wave of regions. The poundm for Ayrshire takes total UK Government commitment to pound. billion across Scotland.

Last year, members took the decision to pay staff ndash I would hopeit happened again we would consider making similar commitments.South of Scotland list MSP Michelle Ballantynecondemned the policy, saying: ldquoIt is completely unacceptable for East Lothian Council to tell their employees to save their holiday time in case of bad weather. It beggars belief that any employer would be this unreasonable. I will be writing to Willie Innes about how deeply unfair his cabinet have been to hardworking council staff.A statement issued on Wednesday by Ms Leitch, the councilrsquos chief executive, said: ldquoThe policy has been refreshed following last yearrsquos severe wintry weather.ldquoThe updated policy reflects feedback following staff consultation, and is consistent with the approach taken by many other public sector organisations.ldquoIt reflects the councilrsquos commitment to protecting the health and safety of all employees, while minimising disruption and maintaining key public services where possible.ldquoIt recognises that employees may periodically face dficulties in attending work during periods of severe weather, or some other adverse event. The policy makes it clear that staff should only travelit is safe to do so.ldquoThe updated policy contains additional advice for staff on what to do in such unusual circumstances.ldquoThe key aspect of the updated policy is to stress the importance of Business Continuity Plans for each council service which advise on what employees should do in any adverse event ndash including potential alternative working arrangements for employeesthey canrsquot get to their normal place of work.ldquoThis includes working remotely or being deployed near to where they live as an alternative."},{"url":null,"title":"135m-needed-for-our-schools","story":"East Lothian is facing an influx of families, with , new homes expected to be delivered across its communities by .East Lothian Council estimates it will have to find at least pound million itself ndash with additional money from housing developers and the Scottish Government required.A report before councillors at last Tuesdayrsquos cabinet meeting in Haddington said that one new secondary school and three new or replacement primary schools were needed to meet established and future demand ndash no locations have been identied in the report.It added that the council would also need to fund ldquoextensions and alterations to approximately  existing primary schools for similar reasons.The report also revealed that the council would have to extend and alter a further  primary schools, as well as creating two new early year centres, to meet an increase in early learning and childcare hours from  to , hours.The report, which outlines the councilrsquos Community Asset Strategy and Management Plan for the next five years, states: ldquoInvestment in new or extended facilities is directed towards those areas of infrastructure which are required to support growth in the authority and in particular in the education learning estate.

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

So Paisley Opera commissioned a brand new English translation of the libretto from Lindsay Bramley, and she consulted the chorus-members over details of the local vernacular to create a version of the doomed love of Mimi and Rudolfo that is set in Paisley and right now. The food and the drink, the toys and the clothes, the patter and the insults, are all instantly recognisable ndash and making opera accessible is what Paisley Opera is all about. The new libretto is full of memorable lines, like Schaunardrsquos assessment of Musettarsquos wealthy beau Alcindoro: ldquoWhat a spanner! Where did she find him In the Parish Hall of St Mirinrsquos Cathedral, the company has gathered for rehearsal. The principals have been working on their parts in Glasgow all afternoon with conductor Alistair Digges, and now they are combining with the chorus and young people director Fiona Williams has found through schools workshops, to run through the wonderful Act  of Puccinirsquos masterpiece. It was one of the main reasons the team chose Boheme as their first full- repertoire work.ldquoAct  is one of the best pieces of theatre ever written, says Williams unequivocally. ldquoThere is so much going on, and so much for the performers to get their teeth into. Rather than have the chorus work as a single unit, we have the chance to give people inidual roles alongside the big chorus numbers, so people are cast as specic characters.She is not alone in her assessment of the wonder of the Cafeacute Momus sequence in La Boheme. In his biography of Puccini, critic Conrad Wilson wrote: ldquoIn Boheme the music is the action, and the action the music, in a manner new to opera. This is what makes the vividly exact musical depiction of every incident in Act  unique in operatic history.Baritone Simon Hannigan, a regular with Scottish Opera and where, established the company after moving to Paisley with his we and finding a community spirit that matched his desire to found a community opera company.ldquoThe whole thing about Paisley Opera is trying to make opera accessible and we wanted to do something that was not too long and had a strong, powerful story that we could easily update.Adds Williams: ldquoWe were looking for was a piece that would be musically fantastic, and give some young professional singers really juicy roles, but also give us a dferent way of engaging with our audience.ldquoWhen we performed Witches in Paisley Abbey it was a front-on presentation, while this has a promenade feel to Act   , and Lindsay Bramley has done an amazing job, with the input of the chorus, in creating a piece that is for Paisley in , in the language of it. That has been an important interactive process.Williams has been part of the creative team in Paisley with Hannigan since the pair worked together on a production of Verdirsquos Simon Boccanegra in Fulham and Paisley Opera was only a germ of an idea.Says Hannigan: ldquoWe wanted a genuinely community-based company, so we put stuff out on Facebook and put posters up in shops asking people to come and join Paisley Opera ndash it doesnrsquot matteryou have never sung before. It was coincidental that it happened at the same time as the City of Culture bid, but fortunate because Renfrewshire Council were putting money into artistic ventures and they generously funded the first show and now a large part of this one too. It was a very happy coincidence.ldquoAt our first meeting  people turned up, and we now have really strong core of people who love it and love singing. Surprisingly few were from other choirs, and a lot just fancied trying singing and had never been to an opera. One of our tenors came up to me after one of our pop-up performances at the Piazza in Paisley and askedit was OKcame along although he had only ever sung on the football terraces. Hersquos great and really throws himself into it.ldquoWitches was the first experience on a stage for many of the chorus, and then Scottish Opera came and did Pagliacci, which a lot of our people did, and that was a great experience. The fact that we were on their doorstep was good for Scottish Opera too, and that has made our singers more ready to do this.Williams echoes how the work of the company has developed: ldquoWitches was written specially, and a blend of poetry, dialogue and music with big choruses that fitted the drama. This is a completely dferent beast and in the process the company as a whole has become much more cohesive.ldquoYou get to know dferent personalities and dferent voices that you can work with. There is a real spirit that has developed over the last  months, and I think that will come across in the central section of Boheme.In the church hall there is evidence aplenty of that being the case, as the challenging ebb and flow of Act  is bashed into shape, with trestle tables, crutches and imaginary trolleys pressed into service as improvised set and props occupying the whole notional stage space. Director Fiona Williams and conductor Alistair Digges are more interested in telling the company what has to be achieved and letting the performers find the best way to that result than in telling them what to do ndash and the fluid nature of the performance in rehearsal reflects exactly how the work will be staged at the University of the West of Scotland on Paisley High Street.ldquoAct , in the impoverished young artistsrsquo flat, is on a thrust stage with a seated audience, explains Williams. ldquoThen wersquoll bring people through into the big foyer space at UWS for the Christmas Market for Act , where you will actually be able to do some shopping. There will be a cake stall with real cakes for sale, andyou are very lucky Alan will sell you a beer.ldquoAct  will also play in that space, and then everyone willto the intimacy of the flat for Act . So it is a mix of promenade and sit-and-watch, and people who come will get the chance to be both the audience and an interactive member of the crowd.With an  piece specially-assembled band of freelancers playing a reduced version of the score, the musicians will be part of the action as well, buskers who will be happy to accept donations flung into their instrument cases.With its teacakes and Tennents, doner kebabs and chicken tikka, Playstation and X-box, River City and St Mirren, this Boheme may have come a long way from a garret in Paris, but the seeds of its interaction were sown by Puccini in his masterful Act  at the end of the th century.Paisley Operarsquos La Boheme is at the University of the West of Scotland, High Street, Paisley at pm on February  and  and pm on February  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-dinosaurs-and-chocolate-shortages","story":"In a fixMIND you, talking of daughters, a reader heard a young woman on the train into town tell her pal: \"Looking back, my le started going downhill when I had to look after my car maintenance instead of my dad doing it.\"Gingerly speakingTHE utterly pompous TV presenter Piers Morgan described young Green MSP Ross Greer as a \"thick ginger turd\" as he took exception to Ross criticising his hero Winston Churchill.

If none of the previous amendment gets a majority, there will be pressure on some Brexiteer Tories to back the Brady amendment, not least to avoid criticism that Parliament when given an array of options could not decide on even one.Conservative sources told The Herald that there was movement from members of the anti-EU European Research Group towards the Brady amendment. Brexit figurehead Boris Johnson said he would \"gladly\" vote for it,it meant legally binding changes to the backstop.Earlier today, Northern Irelandrsquos Democratic Unionists announced they too were supporting it, helping its chances of getting through.Also up for debate is a cross-party proposal from Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory Nick Boles - backed by the Labour frontbench - which would hand control over the Brexit process to Parliament, potentially delaying departure day from March  to the end of the year.Jeremy Corbyn stressed how the Labour leadership was backing the Cooper amendment with a view to having a ldquoshort window of three months to allow time for renegotiation\".He claimed the Government was \"not even close\" to being prepared for leaving the EU without an agreement and pointed out there was \"no chance\" the necessary legislation would be approved eventhe PMrsquos deal did achieve an eventual majority.The Labour leader told MPs their first duty was to block a \"disastrous\" no-deal Brexit.His speech was dogged by a row over his failure to take interventions from MPs, including from his Labour colleague Angela Smith.Eventually, he relented and allowed Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary, to interrupt him and speak from the dispatch box, who then asked why the Labour leader was \"scared\" to allow Ms Smith to come in on what he was saying.Mr Corbyn ignored the question, instead mockingly thanking Mr Gove for his \"brief statement of his leadership intentions\".Mr Bercow was forced to intervene several times, accusing the Conservative benches of an \"orchestrated attempt\" to try and \"shout down the Leader of the Opposition\".It led veteran Labour MP Frank Field to suggest that the debate was \"damaging to our standing with the nation\", and that it should be shut down and MPs moved straight on to the voting, an idea the Speaker firmly rejected.Mr Bercow also selected Labourrsquos own amendment - which would allow debate on its preferred plan or a second referendum - as well as others which would rule out a no-deal Brexit, extend the two-year negotiation under Article  or permit a series of \"indicative votes\" to establish the will of the Commons.In his intervention, Ian Blackford for the SNP said Scotland must have the right to determine its own future and choose to be an independent nation within the EU.\"Let me be very clear: Scotland must no longer be left at the mercy of events. Whatever happens here, the SNP will not be dropping its policy of independence, he declared.The Highland MP went on: ldquoThe Scottish people are sick and tired of being told what the Prime Minister wants them to do Scotlands needs are much more important than what the Prime Minister wants.ldquoScotland needs the power to take its own decisions thats the only way we can stop the Tories dragging us off the clf-edge and into disaster,\" he added.In an attempt to fend off a possible rebellion by Tories, seeking to avoid a no-deal departure, perhaps even some within Government, the PM promised that Tuesdays votes would not be MPs final chance to pass judgement on EU withdrawal.She told the Commons she aimed toto the House \"as soon as possible\" with a revised deal, which would be subject to a \"meaningful vote\" of MPs. If defeated, she would table another amendable motion for debate the following day.If no new deal is reached by February , the PM will make a statement to Parliament that day and table an amendable motion for debate the following day.Mrs May acknowledged that the Commons defeat of the Withdrawal Agreement she agreed with EU leaders last November had been \"decisive\". She told MPs: \"I listened.\"The PM claimed it was in the interests of the whole House to back the Brady amendment, which would resolve the main obstacle to Britain securing a smooth and orderly exit from the EU.She said it was time for Parliament to \"speak as one,\" stressing: \"I will never stop battling for Britain but the odds of success become much longerthis House ties one hand behind my back. I call on this House to give me the mandate I need to deliver a deal this House can support.\"Do that and I can work to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement. Do that and I can fight for a backstop that honours our commitments to the people of Northern Ireland in a way this House can support.

She spoke to Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, this morning and was also due to have phone discussions with key EU leaders over the course of the day.Brussels has been adamant that it will not reopen the Agreement, and Irelands European affairs minister, Helen McEntee, cautioned: \"There can be no change to the backstop. It was negotiated over  months with the UK and by the UK.

However, simply opposing no-deal is not enough to stop it.\"The Government will now redouble its efforts to get a deal that this House can support.\"There was cries of disbelief from the opposition benches when Mrs May declared: \"There is limited appetite for such a change in the EU and negotiating it will not be easy. But in contrast to a fortnight ago, this House has made it clear what it needs to approve a withdrawal agreement.\"The PM said she would seek \"legally binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement that deal with concerns on the backstop while guaranteeing noto a hard border\".And she told MPs: \"If this House can come together, we can deliver the decision the British people took in June , restore faith in our democracy and get on with building a country that works for everyone. As Prime Minister I will work with members across the House to do just that.\"Jeremy Corbyn, who had steadfastly refused to talk to Mrs May on the Brexit process unless she took a no-deal outcome off the table, told MPs he was now prepared to meet with her following the Commons votes.The Labour leader said: Now that the House has voted emphatically to reject the no-deal option the Prime Minister was supporting, could I say we are now prepared to meet her to put forward the points of view from the Labour Party of the kind of deal we want from the European Union.\"To protect jobs, to protect livings standards, and to protect rights and conditions in this country.\"Ian Blackford for the SNP caused uproar from the Conservative benches when he claimed that by passing the Brady amendment the Government had \"ripped up the Good Friday Agreement\".To jeers from Tory MPs he continued: \"We were told the backstop was there to protect the peace process but tonight the Conservative Party has effectively ripped apart the Good Friday Agreement. This House should be ashamed of itself.\"The Highland MP also insisted Scotland had been \"silenced, sidelined and shafted by the Tories\".But later Stephen Kerr, the Conservative MP for Stirling, hit back, saying Mr Blackfordrsquos ldquoinflammatory and dangerous comments were a ldquonew low for the Nationalists.He told The Herald: ldquoThey were a disgrace. To use the Good Friday Agreement the way he did was absolutely shocking. His reckless and dangerous rhetoric should be immediately disowned by the First Minister and the SNP leadership.On the voting, Mr Kerr added that Westminster had ldquomoved signicantly toward getting an orderly Brexit.Elsewhere, Nicola Sturgeon took to Twitter, saying: ldquoThe House of Commons could have asserted itself tonight - instead it indulged the PMrsquos decision to chase a fairytale at the behest of the DUP ERG, and increased the risk of no-deal in the process. A woeful abdication of responsibility.Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: \"The House of Commons has given contradictory instructions, both ruling out no deal and setting the Government on a collision course with the EU, ramping up the chances of no deal.\"Willing the ends but not the means for preventing no deal gets us nowhere.He added: \"Parliament remains effectively deadlocked. The only way forward is a Peoples Vote with the option to remain in the EU.\"In a joint statement, Labours Yvette Cooper and Tory Nick Boles, whose bid to delay Brexit to prevent a no-deal departure from the EU was rejected, said they remained \"deeply concerned that there is no safeguard in place to prevent a clf-edge in March \". Their proposal could have resulted in a new law to prevent a no-deal outcome.But Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, said the Conservatives had shown they \"can and will come together in the national interest\".Boris Johnson, his predecessor, commenting on Mr Tuskrsquos remarks, saying: ldquoIt takes two to tangohellip Believe me the EU has every incentive to give us the deal we need.\"He said thatthe EU would not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, he would support the PMshe chose a \"managed no-deal\" Brexit.He told Sky News: \"I certainly think there are plenty of alternativesthey wont give us the change we need. It is possible to go for a dferent type of agreement, a much more bare-bones agreement some would call it a managed no-deal.He added: \"I dont see why that should not be achievable. I would certainly support the Prime Minister in achieving that.\"Meanwhile, Carolyn Fairbairn, Director General of the CBI, expressed exasperation. \"This is another deeply frustrating day for British business. The never-ending parliamentary process limps on while the economic impact of no deal planning accelerates, she declared.\"The Brady amendment feels like a throw of the dice. It wont be worth the paper it is written onit cannot be negotiated with the EU. Any renegotiation must happen quickly succeed or fail fast, she added.In Dublin, the Irish government insisted: \"The Withdrawal Agreement is not open for re-negotiation.\"It saidthe UK was willing to change its red lines, then that could lead to changes being made to the Political Declaration.\"A change in the UK red lines could lead to a change in the Political Declaration on the framework for the future relationship and a better overall outcome.But the Irish government added that it would be continuing with its contingency planning for all eventualities, including for a no-deal scenario."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9350973.jpg?type=article-full","title":"a9-roadworks-to-continue-for-two-years","story":"Work will begin on Monday th February to install safety barriers and traffic management schemes to narrow lanes, with operations being carried out overnight between .pm and .am.Map: Transport ScotlandComplete overnight closures will be put in place from Friday nd to Monday th February : to : each night, with vehicles erted northwards via the A   A   A.This will continue for two weeks, and is likely to affect overnight journeys and deliveries to Inverness, with some drivers fearing  minutes could be added to journeys.

In  he established his own consultancy business to focus on ruminant mineral nutrition working alongside veterinary practices and livestock farmers.“The correct balance of minerals is important and knowing all the sources of minerals on farm is a key element of maximising livestock performance from grazed grass,” said Mr Bone.Emily Grant, Knowledge Transfer Specialist with QMS commented: “I’m delighted that we have Fiona and Peter coming to speak at the Inverurie Better Grazing meeting.“Minerals play an important role in livestock production, but it’s not an exact science. A shortage, and in some cases an excess of minerals can have a negative effect on production. Supply from pasture can also y through the season, as can livestock requirements.She added: “Fiona and Peter are both enthusiastic and engaging presenters with a great reputation of being able to communicate complex issues in an easily understandable way. I would urge farmers looking to gain a little more insight in to minerals, and how to make the most of them, to attend this meeting.”Now its third year, the main objective of the QMS Better Grazing Groups is to improve livestock producers’ profitability through the better use of grazed grass.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Sandy Reid with PC Laura Fairbairn and PD Ava\"  North East Dog Unit celebrates th anniversary viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"The free “Better Grazing” meeting will begin at am and finish at pm and lunch will be provided.Places at this meeting can be reserved on the Eventbrite booking website, or by contacting QMS direct on    or emailing info@qmscotland."},{"url":null,"title":"house plan approved at oldmeldrum","story":"The future of Oldmeldrum Golf Club has been secured thanks to councillors at the Formartine Area Committee.Plans to build a single house on land at the golf course went before councillors on Tuesday, January .The site in question is located directly behind an existing house next to the A and A junction.It is currently used for turf growing, but it had been classed as “obsolete” as it is cheaper for the Golf Club to buy new turfcompared to the man hours needed to maintain and cut their own.The planning application received a total of  representations, all of which were in support of the idea.However in a report put to councillors ahead of the meeting, council planners recommended that the plan be refused as the land had never been developed, and that the development itself was contrary to policy in the Aberdeenshire Local Development Plan.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the club, Patricia Ramsay said that it is currently facing financial dficulties and the debt that it has is preventing the club from moving forward.She added: “The sale of this unused piece of land is the only way of raising much needed funds.“This would be a leline to this community asset.”After discussing the plan, councillor Paul Johnston suggested that the plans be approved with a delegated grant, and his decision was backed by councillor Karen Adam.Cllr Johnston said: “We have to think about the public circumstances, this is a private club but should it have to wind up, that would have a knock-on effect in the local community.”The proposal went to a vote and seven councillors backed the plan with just one vote against it.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Fyvie Castle is taking part in this years Scottish Snowdrop Festival \"  \"  The magic of snowdrops s to AberdeenshireviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Brothers Guy and Mungo Finlayson also organise the Banchory and Inverurie Beer Festivals\"  Festival to bring Scottish Gin to town viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"ice cream parlour to go orange for charity","story":"Mackie#s of Scotland will colour their most popular flavour, known as #Traditional#, bright orange on Friday, February , to raise awareness and money for charity.Mackie’s ., their Aberdeen ice cream parlour, will be a bright vision with orange lighting, balloons and staff dressed in orange T-shirts for Muscular Dystrophy UK.Even the company’s logo will be converted to an orange spotted cow for the day.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others. If this is approved, it will make a massive dference to the town centre, although there will always be some motorists who will take a chance and park there.\"However, Councillor Mackay has misgivings about the extent of the restrictions planned for other parts of Wick.Wednesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119314.jpg","title":"Trailblazers on right path","story":"MEMBERS of Wick Paths Group joined forces with Friends of the John OGroats Trail to improve a path used by walkers visiting the Castle of Old Wick.They got stuck in to the task of upgrading the narrow, muddy and uneven section from the old rle range to the field at the Grey Bools.

Work is due to start this year, be completed by spring  and create  jobs during the construction phase.Councillor Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness on Highland Council, said: \"While Im keen to see an improvement to the north brae, I still believe we cant take our focus off the south brae. We have two major long-term concerns to focus on here ndash the gradient of the brae and the fact that we are still witnessing serious accidents on the bottom hairpin bend even where there is an escape bed.\"These accidents are a risk to le, causing road closures and impacting in all sorts of ways on our local community and economy. Improvements to the north brae are very welcome and I hope that it is the start of a bigger vision to improve the entire Berriedale Braes.\"We can expect the standard lead-in period of about three months and for discussions to be held with the contractor on how they propose to physically approach the works and discussions with statutory bodies like the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds among others.\"He said that archaeological investigatory works have been completed.The award of the contract was also welcomed by Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce.She said: \"We are delighted to see that after many years of dedicated campaigning by the chamber, Caithness Transport Forum and other local organisations, this project is finally moving ahead. For too long, the Berriedale Braes has acted as a pinch point for travellers on the A north of Inverness, disrupting business and jeopardising investment in the region.\"It has been good to see other work on A improvements and repairs going to local companies in recent years, and we hope the principal contractor will engage closely with our highly skilled local supply chain as these works progress.\"Ms Morris added: \"Now that the contract has been formally awarded, we hope to see clarication on exact start dates and expectedof works very soon.

We are also very aware there needs to be some internal structural alterations.Given the urgency, the board is using its capital reserves to order the new air handling unit which is should be installed in March.ldquoIf the equipment breaks down between now and then, the pool will have to close, Mrs Manson said. ldquoSome people attend the pool on a weekly basis and that is what keeps them going. If it has to close for a number of weeks, it can make a real dference to their mobility and pain control.Retired GP Helen Charley, board chairman, said:ldquoHaving been a GP in Cromarty for  years, and having needed both hips and knees replaced, I am all too aware of how vital the Puffin Pool is to the good health and wellbeing of so many patients like me, she said.Established in  by Dr Malcolm Stevens, the pool has provided an average , sessions each year over the past four years. They are supervised by qualied supervisors and leguards.The majority of income is from its charity shop In Tulloch Street and the fees which are kept affordable for those on benefits, pensions and low incomes although these have increased by  per cent.Supporters are rallying to support the appeal and staff plan a -mile sponsored walk from Tain to Dingwall.To donate, see www.puffinpool or pop in to the pool or shop.Wednesday  Jan  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

This is your chance to have your say and add to the overall business plan. Then all you have to do is vote yes in the ballot and we can make these projects happen.ldquoWe really want to make sure that nobody is missed and that everyone gets their opportunity to vote because this could be a monumental time in our townrsquos history. This could become the year when Dingwall businesses take control over the townrsquos economic future.Mr Murray said: ldquoWe are aware that there must be a decenton their investment. I believe Highland Council currently collect a wee bit more than pound million per annum from non-domestic ratepayers and Irsquove calculated that the levy would need to be between . to three per cent.ldquoThis would allow us to invoice the council for approximately pound,. Itrsquos also possible we would be able to almost match fund this figure from other sources. This would be an amazing amount banked in Dingwall to be spent on Dingwall. This is how we would fund the five-year plan ready to start after a yes vote.He wants remaining surveys, seeking feedback from businesses to a number of questions, ed by Friday, February .Survey results will then be collated with a five-year business plan set to be drafted by the end of March. A yes no vote on BID would then be held in May.Gordon McIntosh, practice manager of Munro  Noble, is a director of BID Inverness and believes the scheme can pay idends for Dingwall too.He said ldquocoach ambassadors had brought more tourists into the city, increasing spend. It meant local businesses were stakeholders in any centre development plans and have the ability to lobby the council over issues of interest. The scheme also paved the way for successful events such as classic car shows, Easter egg hunts and bar and business awards.He said: ldquoWith representatives from a cross section of businesses on the board the strong advocacy we have provided has achieved some notable results.

We have worked with local volunteers, school groups, young offenders, dementia groups, local walking groups and adult learners.In tune with the sustainable development ethos of the group, logs for Mags Wood build have been sourced locally and dragged to the site by Tarzan, a French-bred horse trained for forestry operations ndash and something of a visitor attraction in himself, hugely popular with the school groups who visit the site from time to time.The building project has been able to call on the expertise of local log building expert Henry Fosbrooke, project co-ordinator David Smith and a local volunteer, Don Fraser, who previously worked on the new Queensferry next to the Forth Road Bridge.Mr Harry said that such expertise ldquohas meant that all the measurements done are near perfect.The project has been funded by the Forestry Commission through a community grant amongst ious other sources.Mr Harry said: ldquoThis will be something special for the area and is involving many iniduals and groups in its building ndash truly a community project and something that will last a very, very long time.He is still hoping to find a supplier willing to help with the timber roof cladding required to complete the project, hopefully by the end of March.

The assessments measure the progress of children in P, P, P and S.Ministers have faced repeated calls to ditch the system amid claims some P youngsters were left in tears by the “unnecessary and cruel” assessments.Last year, Holyrood voted to halt the tests for the very youngest children, although this was not binding on the Government.Prof Hargreaves, who works at Boston College in the US, told the committee: “I actually took the P test yesterday. Apparently I did quite well although I didn’t find all the questions easy.“So I have some direct experience, at least as an adult, of what this looks like.”While he said the plan for Scotland “initially was to have a high-stakes standardised test”, Prof Hargreaves said members of the International Council of Education Advisers had warned this “would have all kinds of negative impacts on teaching and learning”.: Data from Scottish P tests could be ‘invalid’, says academicHe said the testing format was “not at all high stakes”, although he said it was “at risk of becoming medium stakes”, which could result in schools coming under “undue pressure” to raise performance levels “over a relatively short period of time”.He said: “Five years ago, systems around the world were in denial that large-scale standardised assessments have negative consequences for students’ learning and wellbeing, and also for the teaching profession responsible for them.“I think that denial is disappearing very quickly everywhere and so we’re all starting to own the problem and say ‘how can we have large-scale information and also good support diagnostically, formatively, for teachers ’.“The solution being tried here is dferent, which is to say how do we use large-scale assessments to inform teachers’ professional judgments so local authorities will have knowledge of their schools, but local authorities will not be able to compare with each other on the basis of the test results. It will be on the basis of the teachers’ professional judgment, part of which is informed by the test results.“You are on the front edge here for the world. The world is really watching you.“And figuring out how to make this a success over the next three years – given the possibility it may not be – and to be a learning government as much as an improving government is actually the key challenge, I think.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4864434.1548784851!/image/image.jpg","title":"alexander mccall smith a literary paradise in india s pink city","story":"The Jaipur Literature Festival, which this year attracted the likes of Irvine Welsh, Indian intellectuals such as Shashi Tharoor, Bollywood singers and Jeffrey Archer, does not charge for tickets, giving this remarkable and magnicent event a democratic feel, writes Alexander McCall Smith.I am writing this column from Jaipur, the Pink City, the capital of the Indian state of Rajasthan. Outside my window, in the grounds of the hotel – a -year-old maharajah’s palace, converted now to commercial use, as is the lot of many palaces in India – a peacock struts. Peacocks are the last bastion of unashamed, shamelessly self-advertisingmasculine flamboyance, but their time of reckoning will no doubt come. The peahens lurk in the bushes, more modest, more hard-working, I imagine, while their fancy partners draw all the admiring glances.Earlier today, on the Oriental Lawn of the hotel, a touching ceremony took place. It is Republic Day, the th anniversary of the promulgation of the Indian Constitution, a document that guided this vastly populous democracy through the sometimes trying second half of the th century and into its exciting and very dferent present. To mark this, the hotel staff, splendidly liveried, some wearing turbans with long colourful tails, lined up before a flagstaff. The national anthem was sung – rare amongst national anthems a lively, infectious tune. Then as the Indian flag, bunched up at the top of the pole, was released, flower petals fluttered from its folds, creating a settling orange cloud. After that, a tug-of-war took place on the lawn between, on the one side, management, smartly suited, and on the other the hotel’s security staff in their impressive unorms. Unfortunately for the security side, their shining black shoes had slippery soles, and they were easily defeated by the combined managers and waiters.: Alexander McCall Smith: Time to wake up and smell Europa’s coffee Jaipur has been en fête, not only because of Republic Day, but for the Jaipur Literature Festival, one of the most remarkable and magnicent literary festivals in the world. The Festival is in large measure the creation of three active imaginations – Sanjoy Roy, and the two founders, the writer Namita Gokhale and the Scottish author and historian, William Dalrymple. Willy, a member of a talented Scottish family, has devoted his le to writing about India, a country which he has portrayed in a series of works written since he was in his early s. His net has widened since the publication of his highly regarded White Mughals, with a book on Afghan history and a recent biography of the Koh-i-Noor diamond. He has also explored Indian beliefs in his Nine Lives, a study of the mosaic of religious systems that exist in this most spiritual of countries.Jaipur started modestly, as all literary festivals must do, but soon made its mark. Authors who came to speak here were taken by the extraordinary atmosphere of enthusiasm that prevails here. Le in India often strikes the outsider as being one great animated and passionate conversation, conducted at high pitch and with a gusto that makes the rest of us sound distinctly piano. The Jaipur Literature Festival very much embodies this with its massive audiences and the sparky exchanges that develop between readers and writers.: Alexander McCall Smith: Edinburgh Airport should charge people to sit downWhat distinguishes this festival from the numerous other book festivals on offer is its democratic feel. The events are free. There are inescapable financial reasons why Edinburgh and Hay, and most other UK festivals, have to charge for tickets, but there is something wonderful about people being able to participate in this sort of event eventhey are on a very tight budget. Jaipur is crowded with young people – students and schoolchildren – who are clearly thrilled to be part of an international event. As a writer, you are stopped at every turn by eager young readers who pose questions they have clearly carefully rehearsed. “What advice can you give me in the writing of my novel ” “What authors should I be readingI want to become an author ” And so on. When last here, I was approached by a young man who wanted to recite to me the poem he had written on the subject of Wittgenstein. That has never happened, as far as I know, to any author who has been at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, nor even at the Tobermory Book Festival on Mull. From that encounter sprung a correspondence that continues today.This year Irvine Welsh was in Jaipur. He has keen readers here, and they love him. They listen to him attentively, just as they listen, in the next breath, to Indian public intellectuals such as Shashi Tharoor or historians such as Charles Spencer. This is a very broad church indeed, no subjects are off limits, and freedom of speech is celebrated with determination and vigour. And the contrasts are striking. At one moment one of the stages will be taken over by a Bollywood singer who has written a memoir , at the next on comes ... well, that seems to be Jeffrey Archer, whose thrillers are lapped up in India. And next up is Germaine Greer. In the evenings the parties begin. Gardens are transformed by thousands of candles. The Indian moon comes up . A sitar plays.

Enshrined in our law is the fundamental right to believe or not to believe in any religion without the fear of persecution. People from all religions live and work together for the greater good of our society. We are far from perfect though. Reports of anti-semitism in the United Kingdom were the second highest in recorded history in . There were over , Islamophobic hate crimes committed in  . Crimes against Catholics rose by  per cent in Scotland in  . There is a lot to work required to combat religious hate crime in our country and I urge politicians of all parties to come together and tackle this issue.I feel passionately about the subject because I am a member of a religious minority — the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — that has a long history of persecution and misrepresentation. Happily, those dark days are largely behind us, but the lessons learned are deeply ingrained and any suggestion of intolerance or persecution of any minority religious group or minority group of any kind is anathema to me.The first President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Joseph Smith, declared the human right to exercise “that free independence of mind which heaven has so graciously bestowed upon the human family is one of its choicest gts”.It is core to my religious belief to respect the religious beliefs of others. This is a respect that is enshrined in the UN Declaration of Human Rights which states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.”: Kirk calls on government to protect persecuted womanWe must protect this right and protect the rights of all faith groups and the right to atheism around the world. Within this must be a protection of Christians. As a member of the UN Security Council, our United Kingdom also has the moral responsibility to protect religious freedom across the globe. The persecution of Christians is increasing at an alarming rate, particularly in Asia where it is estimated that a third of Christians face repression. In China, measures have recently been introduced by President Xi Jinping which have resulted in worshippers being detained, the sale of bibles restricted, and the crucix being removed from public buildings. The Chinese Government has also banned Christmas in some cities.India, a country with the proud history of promoting peace and the largest democracy in the world, has recently become the tenth most dangerous country in the world for Christians to live in. A rise in Hindu extremism has resulted in a greater amount of violent attacks on churches and practising Christians. Across Asia and Africa, there has also been a substantial growth in attacks on Christian women, with higher rates of sexual violence, rape and forced marriages in North Korea, Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya and Pakistan.The Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has recently announced a global review into the persecution of Christians. This is a move that I welcome whole-heartedly. This review will make recommendations on the steps our Government can take to protect Christians around the world.: Sentenced to hang: Pakistan Christian in blasphemy trialBefore this review is complete, I believe that our Government should signy our determination to protect Christians by granting Asia Bibi political asylum. Asia was convicted of blasphemy in Pakistan in  after a group of women said they could not use a bucket she had used for water as she was unclean due to her Christian faith. The accusers claimed that Asia confirmed she made offensive comments about the Prophet Muhammad to the group of women, but this was after Asia was beaten up in her own house. She was sentenced to death by hanging.After ious international campaigns, Asia was acquitted in October . The Government of Pakistan, however, signed an agreement with those leading the protests against Asia’s acquittal a month later which barred her from leaving the country. This is despite her family having to go into hiding. A bounty of half a million Pakistani rupees has been offered to anyone who can kill Asia. It is obvious that Asia’s le is in danger whilst she remains in Pakistan. With the welcome news that the appeal to her conviction has been thrown out, Asia will now be free to leave the country. The people of Canada should be proud that an offer of asylum was made by their Government after the original conviction. The UK did not make such an offer and it should have. This needs to change and a clear message sent that we will provide a safe haven for people such as Asia.Britain should be playing a leading role in protecting Christians around the world. The review announced by the Government is the first step in our becoming that. I look forward with anticipation to what it recommends but we must deliver more than words. Around  Christians a month are killed due to their faith and millions are oppressed. We must be brave and make it clear to the world that we, as a Christian nation, do not tolerate the persecution of Christians anywhere.Stephen Kerr is the Scottish Conservative MP for Stirling©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4864513.1548837157!/image/image.jpg","title":"ian blackford scotland must have option to be independent eu nation","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The SNP#s Westminster leader infuriated the DUP in the aftermath of last night#s Commons votes on Brexit by claiming the Conservatives had #ripped up the Good Friday Agreement#.Ian Blackford accused the UK Government of treating the Northern Irish peace process with contempt by supporting Brexiteer demands to replace the backstop in the EU withdrawal agreement and called for Scotland to have the option of becoming and independent EU state.“Tonight the Conservative Party has effectively ripped apart the Good Friday Agreement,” Mr Blackford said.The DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds replied that it was “utterly reckless to talk in those terms”.Mr Dodds added: “Nobody in Northern Ireland, no political party, is advocating any kind of hard border in the island of Ireland, and we certainly do not advocate what others advocate, which is creating borders in the United Kingdom or ripping up the United Kingdom.”In the latest escalation of constitutional rhetoric over Brexit, Mr Blackford said during the debate the UK Government must respect a demand from the Scottish Parliament for a second independence referendum.“If our First Minister calls for a section  order, then his house must respect the will of the Scottish people,” he told the House of Commons.Nicola Sturgeon is expected to reveal details of her timetable for a second independence vote within weeks, with the UK set to leave the EU at the end of March. Mr Blackford said Scotland “must no longer be left at the mercy of events” and must have the choice to become an independent member of the EU.“Whatever happens here, the SNP will not be dropping its policy of independence,” he said. To heckles from Conservative MPs, Mr Blackford continued: “I can see members shaking their heads because they’re running scared – like the Prime Minister, they fear they would lose an independence referendum.”Meanwhile, former prime minister Tony Blair warned a no-deal Brexit could break up the UK.“If we leave Europe and do a hard Brexit or a no-deal Brexit, I don’t think there’s any doubt it is going to impose a strain on the United Kingdom,” he said at a Brexit event yesterday.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4862285.1548404780!/image/image.jpg","title":"alex salmond unique case is not unprecedented says advocate","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Many people are asking whether Alex Salmond, with his major public profile, could possibly get a fair trial in Scotlandany charges proceed.Many people are asking whether Alex Salmond, with his major public profile, could possibly get a fair trial in Scotlandany charges proceed.If challenged, the court’s answer will be considered in the context of the publicity around the allegations. To date no case in Scotland has been stopped because of prejudicial publicity and that’s despite there having been some high-profile cases that attracted considerable, sometimes extremely prejudicial, media attention.These cases were dferent in that the accused were not well-known public figures, but it was argued that publicity about the allegations could prejudice any trial.I wouldn’t call this case unprecedented, but it has its own unique aspects. However, the challenges for the court have been considered before. Two examples are the trial of William Beggs for what became known as the “Limbs in the Loch” murder, and that of Nat Fraser, who was accused of killing his we, Arlene. There had been a great deal of reporting about the cases and the courts had to decide whether fair trials could be achieved. In both situations, the courts decided the cases could proceed fairly, referring to the safeguards of the passage of time between any publicity and a trial the focusing effect for a jury of listening to the evidence and the strong directions given to a jury in such cases to decide only based on evidence they hear in court.Those representing Salmond may argue that he is uniquely well-known and that some allegations against him have, to an extent, been canvassed in the media. They may say that it will be almost impossible to find jurors who have never heard of him.

However, I am delighted all of these hurdles have been overcome and I can’t wait for the work to get underway.”Originally submitted in  and , a spokesperson for Mr Ali said that the two applications pertaining to the development were delayed due to theof time the Portree planners took to reply to his architect#s letter regarding the ratication of the Conditions in the Listed Building Consent and Planning Permission.In response to those comments, Councillor John Gordon said: “Planning for the proposal was granted on th September , and Listed Building Consent was given on th September .“Given this, I am disappointed at how long it has taken for these plans to be taking forward since then, but I welcome the progress that is now being made.” that work on the ‘Poseidon’ hotel will begin in March.Article by Adam Gordon"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/KEEP-TO-THE-LEFT-SHARON-ANSLOW-1-Copy.jpg","title":"skye womans keep left campaign gathers","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineStickers in hired cars, improved signage and leaflets in tourist accommodation have all been suggested as practical moves to encourage visitors to the Highlands to remember to drive on the left.An awareness campaign on the issue has gathered recent momentum thanks to the efforts of a Skye woman who was involved in an accident near Sligachan at the end of last month.Sharon Anslow was injured in the crash on the th of December – an incident which she says happened after she moved to avoid an oncoming car on the same side of the road.In the wake of the incident Sharon, from Carbost, launched a ‘keep left’ petition and her work has been backed by local politicians.Last weekend Sharon met with MSP Kate Forbes, Skye Councillor John Finlayson and Skye police Sergeant Bruce Crawford to discuss ways to bolster the awareness campaign.Calls have been made for Transport Scotland to install extra signs and paint new road markings, while Visit Scotland are being asked to support a leafleting campaign.Dashboard stickers are also being organised for local car-hire companies, with the target being to pressure national firms to follow suit and install similar notices inside all their vehicles.Police plan to aid support to the campaign by stopping and issuing advice to drivers as they cross the bridge.Kate Forbes MSP said: “It was a very constructive meeting with Councillor John Finlayson, Sergeant Bruce Crawford and Sharon Anslow.“We had a robust conversation about road safety in Skye and Lochalsh and what further actions we could take to change this.“Sharon is a remarkable woman as it’s only a few weeks since she was in a traumatic accident and already she’s campaigning and working to ensure there are fewer accidents.“Her ‘Keep Left’ campaign has galvanised people across the world, some of whom have been to Skye on holiday.“I will be organising the next meeting with Transport Scotland to discuss signage, road markings and other things.“In the meantime, I’ll be writing to VisitScotland and all the car hire companies to ask them to ensure there is information for visiting drivers.“There’s a lot we can do and I’m delighted to be working with Sharon as well as John and Bruce.”Councillor John Finlayson added: “It was very useful to meet up with Sharon, Kate and Bruce to exchange ideas and plan how we can move forward support for Sharon’s Keep Left campaign and hopefully improve road safety on Skye and across the Highlands generally.“We will continue to liaise to move forward the actions we agreed and organise a meeting with Transport Scotland and council personnel.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/PLOCKTON-PANTO-19-9.jpg","title":"wanted man could be in skye","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA -year old man wanted by police in connection with a “serious incident” that took place in Inverness last August could be on Skye.Donald Stewart Snr is described as being white, approximately ’” tall, with fair blonde hair cut very short.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

Our hard-won peace process and its political architecture have too often been taken for granted.We may have peace, but we have not seen enough progress.When over  Irish citizens from the north signed an open letter to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in December  it came at the end of a tumultuous and politically defining year.That January the Good Friday Agreement political institutions collapsed amidst the political and financial scandal of RHI.It served to confirm the growing view of northern nationalists that political unionism was not committed to proper power-sharing through the denial and refusal of equality, rights and respect towards the section of the community to which we belong, rights such as: access to justice marriage equality: language rights.It would seem that there can be no regulatory alignment on this island, and Bangor must be as British as Finchley, unless you are gay and want to be married or seek to live a le through the medium of Irish with statutory protection.This contempt mobilised the nationalist and republican electorate: in turn the unionist political majority in the Assembly was ended.Increased unionist belligerence continued, and then, the nationalist constituency sent a stark message during the subsequent Westminster election, that it was turning its back on Westminster.However, the political process in the north had already been seriously destabilised due to the result of the EU Referendum in , when a majority of people in the north voted to remain in the EU.The British government ignored that democratic result and the emerging negative implications of Brexit became major talking points across the island.Every report and expert assured us that there will never be a hard border in Ireland and that the Good Friday Agreement was constitutionally sacrosanct as an internationally binding agreement. Yet, within the past week, we have been told by Theresa May that the Good Friday Agreement is up for negotiation and the European Commission have confirmed that a no-deal Brexit will bring a hard border in Ireland and yesterday Leo Vardakar advised the World Economic Forum that there may be soldiers on the border.This culmination of events and concerns motivated me and others to make the first direct public appeal in late  to Leo Varadkar to stand up and speak out in defence of Irish citizens# rights in the north.We felt it was essential that Irish citizens in the north heard reassurance from the Irish Government that the reality of abandonment experienced by our parents and grandparents would not be visited upon our generation.The back page of your programme today carries an assurance from the Taoiseach that: “To the nationalist people in Northern Ireland, I want to assure you that we have protected your interests throughout these negotiations. Your birth right as Irish citizens, and therefore as EU citizens, will be protected.There will be no hard border on our island. You will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.”This assurance cannot simply be a historical quote.It must be a living commitment.It must mean that there can be no hard border on our island.That my children will not have to endure the ignominy of being stopped at Newry or Derry, when travelling to Croke Park for a match, or to Donegal for a holiday.One of the objectives of this conference today is to assert to the Irish Government that we are their citizens, bearing their passport and that we insist on our full access to citizenship, but rights, human rights are for all.No citizen in the north should endure a diminished sense of their citizenship as a result of Brexit. Everyone benefits when rights are protected, and all traditions and communities are respected and valued.Today’s conversation is about all of that. We seek to provide a space for a discussion to begin.It has to begin somewhere. And when we are told that now is not the right time, I ask then when is the right time. So,not now, when Nelson Mandela once observed that, “If you wait for textbook conditions they will never occur.”We believe this is the right time to have a conversation about the future. Failure to encourage and embrace that potential would be reckless and irresponsible.In the challenges which will immediately confront us in the coming weeks and months we will require a unied and coherent mobilisation of broad northern nationalist and progressive voices.Our children and new generations deserve a future better than the past which we endured. I wouldn’t have believed you, had you said a few short months ago that my small club [Naomh Éanna] would be in an All-Ireland final in two weeks time, but the unexpected can overtake events.I have seen how history and identity, timing and preparation and the taking of opportunity can reshape history and positively define and improve lives.Tapaidh an déis.

Written by Patricia Gormley and directed by Alan McKee, the play begins to a backdrop of Abba’s Money, Money, Money, as final demand letters are piling up at the business but Olive is keen to keep on trucking and put on a brave face for her staff and loyal customers. Christina Nelson plays a total of four characters in the production including enthusiastic but scatty trainee Jolene, nearby fold resident and ‘the road’ gossip Granny Eileen, Mrs Hughes with notions above her station and Cryin’ Air stewardess Cha Marie who has an imminent wedding to plan. Such is Christina’s talent to twist, turn, gurn and transform herself from a -year-old to a grouchy, rollator reliant octogenarian and back to the fur hat wearing, buttoned up Mrs Hughes had my companion asking: “Is that still the same actress ”What Patricia has created with her second offering is detailing just how much hair salons are part and parcel of community le. They are a haven for gossip, catch ups and for many of our elderly neighbours the place to go to for a hot cup of tea, their coat to be taken off and hung up and a weekly rinse and ‘set’ with the obligatory stacks of “lacquer”.Roisin and Christina work and bounce off each other brilliantly and there is a particularly heart felt and tender scene between Olive and Mrs Hughes that isn’t played for laughs as we reach the final, rousing act.Belly laughs, a few tears and rooting for the character of Olive made for a great night’s theatre and proved the perfect tonic as a standing ovation for all involved showed just how much the audience lapped up the story. We definitely haven’t seen the end of these characters.#Is That Too Hot# runs at The MAC theatre until February .

Within minutes of the vote SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the Conservatives had #effectively ripped apart the Good Friday Agreement#.DUP deuty leader Nigel Dodds reacted angrily to that claim, saying it was “utterly reckless to talk in those terms”.MPs earlier voted voted  to  in favour of rejecting a ‘No Deal’ Brexit.The vote outcome was met by a firm stance from EU leaders who insisted the Withdrawal Agreement would not be renegotiated. Tánaiste Simon Coveney said the backstop was “necessary” and “the developments at Westminster do nothing to change this”.European Council President Donald Tusk reaffirmed the EU position, adding: #The Withdrawal Agreement is and remains the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Withdrawal Agreementis not open for re-negotiation.#The vote has received widespread reaction from local politiicans. Sinn Féin MP Chris Hazzard has said the British parliament needs to realise that it cannot push the people of Ireland around over Brexit.  “What is happening at Westminster is clearly not in the interests of Ireland,” he said.“Instead it is all about the right-wing Brextremists of the Tory party who have been allowed to set the agenda. “In its desperation, the British government is trying to threaten and intimidate the Irish people with a hard border and an economic clf edge. “They need to realise the days of the British government and British parliament threatening the people of Ireland and pushing them around are over and not coming back. “The Irish government and EU need to stand firm against attempts to sabotage what has already been agreed.#SDLP leader Colum Eastwood hit out at the British government#s decision to #allow the dissolution of the Irish backstop# over the heads of people in Northern Ireland.He said: #Tonight, London decided that the interests of the people in Northern Ireland were secondary to the needs of the Conservative Party. The rejection of the Irish backstop, the only viable mechanism to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, is an affront to the Good Friday Agreement.#Let me be clear, the people of Northern Ireland did not consent to this. We will continue to engage with the Irish government to ensure that the backstop, as reiterated by Brussels, will not be undermined in the slightest.#Alliance Brexit spokesperson Stephen Farry MLA said Parliament has voted to send Brexit down “a dead-end” on the backstop.“Many people will be exasperated at a dysal Parliament unable to process and work through the real choices facing the UK around Brexit. Thirty-one months on from the referendum there is still no coherent way forward,” he added.“Those opposed to a no deal and alternative softer versions of Brexit are struggling to uny around an effective pathway. While there may be a majority for the principle of a no deal, there is no agreed means to stop it. By contrast, the Prime Minister has conducted a shameful u-turn on the backstop, and abandoned the deal she made with the EU only a few weeks ago.“Throughout the Brexit process, the Prime Minister and UK government have been clear they would avoid a hard border in Ireland at all costs. The need for the backstop only arises from the UK#s decision to leave the EU and the mutually incompatible red lines. At no stage has the UK government produced any viable alternative. And crucially, the Prime Minister did sign up to the backstop as part of the Withdrawal Agreement and defend its necessity. This abandonment of the backstop is an enormous act of bad faith and sends a terrible message to the people of Northern Ireland.“However, this is a pointless victory for the government. The EU is rightly clear the backstop and the Withdrawal Agreement are not up for renegotiation, and have indicated as such once again today. So this represents a dead-end. This amendment is therefore the ultimate unicorn, only serving to waste time and increase the risk of a catastrophic no deal crash-out.“There are consequences to constant delay and failure to face reality, as businesses and others cannot wait for certainty, and may choose to take proactive decisions which impact on investment and jobs.#"},{"url":null,"title":"eus guy verhofstadt expresses bewilderment at westminster brexit process","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

in the concept of the Irish backstop.https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland eu-has-blown-a-hole-in-the-backstop-nigel-dodds-claims-.htmlEmailDUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds has claimed the EU’s chief negotiator has “blown a hole” in the concept of the Irish backstop..pushThe DUP MP for Belfast North said Michel Barnier had said some checks and controls could be done away from the border and claimed that meant a backstop would not be necessary.Speaking at Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Dodds also accused the Irish Government of “highly reckless” talk over the potential of a no-deal Brexit to cause trouble at the border.He said: “In recent days we’ve heard the Irish prime minister talk about bringing his troops up to the border in the event of no deal, we’ve heard the Irish deputy foreign minister talk of people jumping out of windows – isn’t this highly-reckless talk extremely dangerous in the present circumstances “That sort of rhetoric should be toned down and instead focused on what Michel Barnier said the other day – that even in the event of a no deal we would sit down and find operational ways to have checks and controls away from the border.“Isn’t that the way forward, and it blows a hole in the entire concept of this backstop ”Prime Minister Theresa May did not agree that Mr Barnier’s comments, which also included an insistence the current backstop was the only arrangement possible, meant she could do away with the backstop and instead reiterated her commitment to no hard border.She said: “I will be speaking to the Taoiseach later today and it’s important for us to work with the Government of Ireland on the arrangements that will be in place in the future.“We obviously have sent a clear message from this House about what needs to happen in relation to the backstop but we retain our commitment to no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.”Mrs May should rule out a no deal Brexit, Labour MP Jack Dromeysaid, because it would be contemptuous of Parliament and impoverish the country.“We’re  days away from a clf,” he said. “If we plunge into an abyss our country will be a poorer country in every sense of the word.“Last night this House voted that there can be no question of a no-deal Brexit.“Will the Prime Minister honour the will of Parliament and rule out a no-deal Brexit because to proceed with a no-deal Brexit would not only impoverish our country it would be contemptuous of Parliament.”Mrs May responded that MPs should focus on getting a deal to avoid leaving without a deal.She added: “What Parliament also voted for last night was to say that it wanted to leave the EU with a deal and it identied what was necessary to change in the deal in order to enable that to happen and for the support of this House to be given to a deal.”SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused Mrs May of misleading the House with her plan to seek an “alternative arrangement” on the backstop, because the EU had already ruled out renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement.The MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber asked: “Has the Prime Minister inadvertently misled the House or is this Government’s incompetence reached a whole new level ”Mrs May said she was taking back to Brussels what was agreed by Parliament, and then criticised Mr Blackford for comments he made suggesting the Tories were “ripping up the Good Friday Agreement”, calling them “frankly irresponsible”.The SNP leader said that was a “disgraceful response” from a PM acting with “sheer irresponsibility”.Mr Blackford went on to accuse the Government of dragging Scotland out of the EU against its will.He said: “We are scunnered by this Government ignoring Scotland.“Prime Minister, do you accept that you have promised Scotland everything, you have delivered nothing ”Mrs May said a new report showed % of Scottish exports went to the rest of the UK, three times more than with the rest of the European Union.“Yet he represents a party that wants to erect a border between Scotland and England,” she said.“The biggest threat to the future of Scotland is sitting on those benches.”"},{"url":null,"title":"may faces european resistance to efforts to reopen

Time is running out. We are ready to talk about the future but now is the time to agree on the conditions of the separation. The withdrawal agreement that is on the table is the best possible agreement. Let us not reopen it➖@NathalieLoiseau https:t.co ChOxvsTmR— France Diplomacy🇫🇷January , The Prime Minister also clashed with Jeremy Corbyn in the Commons ahead of private talks with the Labour leader on the Brexit process.Having boycotted earlier cross-party talks, the Labour leader said he was ready to discuss a “sensible” approach to Brexit after MPs voted on Tuesday night to rule out no deal.Mr Corbyn demanded to know which of her red lines she was prepared to compromise on in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit.“It really is time that the Prime Minister acknowledged she has got to move on from the red lines she put down in the first place,” he said.But Mrs May told Mr Corbyn he had opposed “every move by this Government to get a deal” and “he is the one risking no deal”.In dramatic scenes on Tuesday night, MPs voted by a margin of  to  to back a plan – the “Brady amendment” – which requires the PM to replace the Agreement’s controversial backstop with “alternative arrangements” to keep the Irish border open after Brexit.But asked five times on BBC Radio ’s Today programme what this “alternative” involved, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay was unable to provide any specic explanation.Mr Barclay said the UK was “exploring in terms of the use of technology… looking at things like the time limit” to deal with the backstop.He added: “There are a number of options, there are issues in terms of having time limits, issues in terms of exit clauses, issues in terms of technology, and this will be the nature of the negotiation with the European Union in the coming days.”Downing Street has suggested that the UK’s position could involve a time-limit or exit clause to the backstop or swapping it for a free trade agreement, as proposed in the so-called Malthouse Compromise drawn up by MPs from the Tories’ Remain and Leave wings.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  But the suggestion that the deal struck between the Government and Brussels could be unpicked was rejected by senior figures across the EU.European Council president Donald Tusk will speak by phone with Mrs May on Wednesday evening.Following Tuesday night’s votes in the House of Commons, Mr Tusk’s spokesman said: “The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for renegotiation.”Brussels’ chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told reporters that the EU’s position was “very clear”, while Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said the backstop remained “necessary”. French President Emmanuel Macron said the Withdrawal Agreement was “not renegotiable”.European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans said there was “an increasing risk” that the UK will leave without a deal in March.“We continue to urge the UK Government to clary its intentions with respect to its next steps as soon as possible,” he added.The European Parliament’s chief Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, expressed frustration with the British: “What needs to stop is this: An amendment with  votes for, then an amendment with  votes against, an amendment that barely pulls through, one that fails… That is no way to build a future relationship with the EU.”FM @HeikoMaas on #Brexit: Germany and the entire EU will stand by Ireland on the backstop. We will not allow 🇨🇮 to be isolated on this issue. pic ELUrYJJQyN— GermanForeignOfficeJanuary , Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: “Germany and the entire Union are firmly on Ireland’s side. We will not allow Ireland to be isolated on this issue.”French Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau said: “The Withdrawal Agreement that is on the table is the best possible agreement. Let us not reopen it.”Mr Barclay claimed that Tuesday night’s amendments, two weeks after Mrs May suffered the heaviest parliamentary defeat in modern history over the meaningful vote, had “overturned a defeat of  into a victory”.But there was concern from the business community, with CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn describing the Brady amendment as “a throw of the dice” and warning that firms were having to accelerate expensive no-deal preparations.Brexiteer ringleader Jacob Rees-Mogg made clear on Wednesday that he remains prepared to see the UK leave without a deal on March the EU refuses to reopen negotiations.“Ifthink the Withdrawal Agreement is non-negotiable then we will have to leave without an agreement,” he told TalkRadio. “Do they want the £ billion, do they want an agreement… or us just to leave  It’s up to them.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37747512.ece/21d63/AUTOCROP/w620h342/s_Eye_-_Belfa%20249.jpg","title":"muckamore abbey seclusion room used 745 times in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At ious points of negotiations it was important to delve in and read parts.“It’s not like a novel where you sit down and think it’s a cracking read.”Democratic Unionist MP Ian Paisley Jr raised comments made by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar last week after he suggested that soldiers couldto the borderBrexit goes badly wrong.Mr Raab,  who stepped down as Brexit secretary last year, said he was “surprised” by the political approach from Dublin, and added: “We want to retain a strong relationship with our Irish partners.

He could not answer and replied it would \"explore\" dferent options.  days to go. This is a plan to keep the Tory Party together while trashing the country.— David LammyJanuary , Mr Rees-Mogg made clear on Wednesday that he remains prepared to see the UK leave without a deal on March the EU refuses to reopen negotiations.“Ifthink the Withdrawal Agreement is non-negotiable then we will have to leave without an agreement,” he told TalkRadio. “Do they want the £ billion, do they want an agreement … or us just to leave  It’s up to them.”Labour’s Ian Murray, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a second EU referendum, said: “The PM is going to Brussels to demand alternative unicorns to the Northern Irish backstop but can’t tell anyone what these alternatives are.“That’s because there isn’t an alternative. Her only aim is to look after her party at the expense of the country.”MPs supported a cross-party amendment opposing a no-deal Brexit by  votes to . But while this will place political pressure on the Prime Minister, it is not legally binding on the Government, unlike the legislation which remains on the statute book naming March  as exit day.Those determined to prevent no-deal or delay Brexit will have a further opportunity no later than February , when Mrs May has promised the Commons a further opportunity to vote on her plans.There were recriminations on the Labour side after  MPs rebelled to vote against an amendment from Yvette Cooper which would have given Parliament the power to direct the Brexit process, potentially delaying withdrawal until the end of the year.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Leading Labour Remainer Chuka Umunna said: “There is no point claiming you are opposed to a ‘no deal’ Brexityou are not prepared to will the legal means to stop it happening.”Shadow cabinet minister Barry Gardiner insisted that Mr Corbyn has not backtracked by agreeing to speak with Mrs May while no-deal Brexit remains a possibility.He told BBC Radio ’s Today:  “Parliament yesterday explicitly said that they did not want no deal to happen and the Prime Minister, when it came to the summing-up after the debate, accepted that that was the will of the House.“She has said she will be coming back in two weeks’ time, she hopes, with something from Europe, but there will be another opportunity at that stageshe has run down the clock further, for a legislative vehicle to then be put in place by Parliament to avoid no-deal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coveney we need to work together dont just listen to dup listen to all in northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said he struggled with parts of the deal with the EU agreed by the PM in particular protecting the integrity of the EU single market and ensuring Northern Ireland had \"unfettered access\" to the GB market place.

Mr Raab said looking back at his talks with Michel Barnier - who agreed with him during one meeting last July that the backstop had to be \"short\" - the former minister said the government had not \"grasped the opportunity\" to thrash out the detail on that.\"That was not followed through with enough vigour on our side despite my best efforts and advice,\" he said.Mr Raab said there was some in Dublin, Northern Ireland and the EU Commission who wanted to use the backstop as a means to control the UK after Brexit. He said this was regularly reported through the diplomat channel and it would be \"naive to think that was not part of the debate\". He also accused the Taoiseach of leaking and misrepresenting a private conversation over dinner he had with Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney. He said he never proposed a three-month expiry to the backstop, as had been reported in November.The MP also said he was \"surprised\" and would \"question the wisdom\" of remarks made about theof troops on the border after Leo Varadkar said thats how a border could look in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Mr Raab said those people in Northern Ireland who supported the backstop had not been ignored but their views \"taken into account\" and considered.On the border, he said it was \"imminently solvable\" with \"good will, technology and centralised process\". He said his department had not gone into the level of detail on how checks would be managed at the hundreds of crossing between Northern Ireland and the Republic. He said he had a good understanding of the border saying he wanted to do it \"properly and not some flyby\" having visited it. He said he was taken on a drive by the PSNI from Crossmaglen to Newry.

the rest of the week due to increasing concern over dangerously unhealthy air pollution.https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news

Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, have been shut for the rest of the week due to increasing concern over dangerously unhealthy air pollution..pushThe country’s prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha directed Bangkok’s governor to order the closure of  schools after officials said the pollution would continue until next Monday.They said still air and heavy traffic are causing a buildup of particles in the air.The Pollution Control Department said the amount of especially dangerous tiny PM . particles has risen in all areas in and around Bangkok since Monday.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Bangkok’s cityscape is covered in thick smog “We decided to eliminate the problem by closing down the schools,” said Police General Asawin Kwanmuang, the city’s governor.“We’re afraid that it can be dangerous for the children.”Technical colleges are included among the closed institutions but universities are still considering what to do.Mongkolsak Lajina, the father of a five-year-old pupil, suggested that closing schools was a token gesture.“I don’t think it will help much.“It helps that students do not have to commute to schools,” he said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A child leaves school wearing his protective face mask “But we need better measures to effectively deal with this problem.”The Public Health Ministry said people should refrain from outdoor activities and exercise, and look instead for indoor venues.Many commuters and pedestrians have begun wearing face masks.“These measures will help only temporarily,” said Aek Pongpairoj, a doctor living in Bangkok.“If we want a long-lasting solution, all sectors must be involved, not just government agencies for example, the private sector involving construction.“There are so many construction sites and I can see that preventive measures aren’t enough.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Parents pick up their children from school Pollution levels also rose where in Thailand, bringing a heavy haze to Chiang Mai and other northern areas well ahead of the annual “smoky season” that normally begins in late February, when farmers burn agricultural waste and dry weather allows airborne particles to accumulate.Efforts to reduce the pollution level in Bangkok by hosing down roads and spraying water in the air have been criticised as ineffective.People were asked to limit open-air burning of materials, and have even been advised to use shorter incense sticks in upcoming Lunar New Year celebrations.Governor Asawin said he would consider declaring parts of Bangkok “pollution control zones”they exceed safe levels for three straight days.That could include control of diesel-engine exhausts, outdoor burning and construction activities, and possible road closings and ersions."},{"url":null,"title":"council backs motion extra psni resources wake derry bomb","story":"Local councillors have voted overwhelmingly in favour of a proposal which called on the NI Policing Board to provide additional resources for Derry police in wake of the recent bomb attack.The motion was put forward by UUP Alderman Derek Hussey which stated the ‘council are mindful of the need for increased resources to the PSNI to frustrate and eliminate the criminality currently being perpetrated on our citizens throughout the district and therefore call on the Chief Constable, Policing Board and Secretary of State to address the present deficit.’It was seconded by his party colleague, Alderman Mary Hamilton.Cllr Hussey said what happened was ‘absolutely scandalous’ and an attack on ‘citizens and the economy of the area’.  It placed the police service under ‘tremendous pressure’ and removed officers from ‘other duties’, he added.He urged the council to call on the Chief Constable and others to address ‘the obvious deficit in resources’.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

opinion, saying an earlier motion had been passed which condemned ‘all violence’ yet Cllr Hussey’s proposal was in support ‘of one of the groups responsible for violence’.  This week, he said, the PSNI has carried out a ‘large number of violent and destructive house raids’ which have also affected ‘vulnerable people’ and those arrested who had ‘no evidence put to them’.Sinn Féin Councillor and former Mayor, Maoliosa McHugh, said it was a matter for the Policing and Community Safety Partnership, to raise these matters and ensure there is an acceptable level of policing in the community.  He and his party members could accept the motion, he explained, but said they were totally opposed to police violence towards members of the community as ‘that type of reaction by the state gave rise to violence in this country’.Cllr McHugh said he would agree with additional resourcesrequired but added that there are ‘many areas’ which require extra funding at present.Alderman Drew Thompson, DUP, told the meeting he had met with the Chief Constable since the Bishop Street bomb and would ‘certainly support’ this motion.After further discussion Cllr Hussey’s motion was carried, thirty-three councillors voted in favour but all Independent councillors voted against or abstained."},{"url":null,"title":"purchase foyle college lands marks milestone magee university expansion","story":"Ulster University has confirmed the purchase of Foyle College lands in Derry which will allow for future development of the Magee campus.It was expected that Ulster University would buy lands at the Duncreggan Road site when Foyle College relocated to its £.m Limavady Road site last year, however, the deal has experienced delays.The local community and politicians are optimistic that this will pave the way for long-awaited expansion at the Magee Campus which has seen a drop in student numbers and courses cut in recent years rather than growth.In a statement to the Derry News at the weekend an Ulster University spokesperson confirmed that the deal included both the lands on the Duncreggan Road and playing fields opposite the old Foyle College junior school on the Northland Road.She added: “Ulster University has completed its purchase of the Foyle College lands, marking a milestone in the development and expansion opportunities for Magee campus.“The purchase follows the opening last year of the £m state-of-the-art teaching centre at the heart of the Magee campus, which has already enhanced the vibrancy of campus le and paved the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.“Options for the Foyle College lands will now be explored in line with the University’s plans for growth of the Magee campus and its wider estates strategy.”Sinn Féin MP Elisha McCallion has

university.  This land will be allow for the continued expansion of Magee.\"The key stakeholders involved have been working on the acquisition of this land for some time and I welcome the fact that it has now been completed.\"I will also be convening a meeting of all parties to meet with the permanent secretary of the Department of Health to discuss the plans for the establishment of a medical school at Magee.\"This is part of the wider plans for the growth and expansion of Magee which will provide more opportunities for young people and assist the development of a new, vibrant economy in the north west.\"Meanwhile, SDLP Councillor Sinead McLaughlin commented: \"This is a very important milestone as it reaffirms Ulster University’s commitment to the further expansion of the Magee Campus. The growth and development of the higher education provision within the North West region remains a political priority for our party as the university is a key driver for growing a vibrant regional economy.\"A key component of the University Growth Plan is the establishment of a Postgraduate Medical School. SDLP Leader, Colum Eastwood, has expressed his commitment to join a cross-party group to meet with the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Health to ensure that the Medical School gets approval to proceed before the end of May  as this is a critical deadline for the first student intake in September .\""},{"url":null,"title":"newtown amateur dramatic society is staging dying to meet you at

The resulting m scrum led to a succession of drives for the line and when the ball was recycled a loose pass missed its intended target, but Rory Campbell took the ball smartly on the bounce to score in the corner for an early Malone lead.After Paddy Wright missed a long-range penalty, Ballynahinch earned an excellent attacking position with a m line out following an excellent Ross Adair touch-finder. The line out was won, but Malone forced a crucial turnover and the chance went begging.Both sides continued to be careless in possession in a niggly match, which was low on quality.On  minutes a Malone breakdown penalty gave lsquoHinch a chance to drive for the line and as they progressed, Malone blatantly killed the ball and could count themselves lucky not to receive a yellow. Wright slotted the penalty to close the gap to two points.Following a Malone penalty miss, lsquoHinch botched their own line out allowing the home side to pile into the . Zack McCall was penalised for offside as Malone looked to sweep the ball wide and was given a yellow card. Malone then scored from a tap penalty to take a - half-time lead.The second half followed a similar pattern to the first with Ballynahinch going further behind to another try from the prolic Campbell after another lsquoHinch mistake on their own line out.Ross Adair reduced the arrears on  minutes with a converted try to put lsquoHinch in bonus point territory and the away side belatedly roused themselves to pile the pressure on Malone during the final ten minutes.However, the home defence held and lsquoHinch had to settle for a point, earned largely through the woes of the Malone place kicker, who failed to land any of his attempts on goal.A disappointing start to  for the locals and they will need to be more accurate this week as Ballymena come to Ballymacarn Park.Malone Ballynahinch AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygowan’s Emma hoping to make waves at Abu Dhabi Special Olympics  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN swimmer is hoping to make a big splash when she goes to the Middle East in March.Twenty three year-old Emma Carlisle will be going for gold when she swims for Ireland at the  Special Olympics World Summer Games in Abu Dhabi.Emma is one of seven athletes from Co Down included in the -strong Team Ireland squad for the Games which take place over March -.Newry is well represented with four athletes selected.

She suffered from the heart condition Tricuspid Atresia.Mrs Trainor has described the decision to send babies to the Alder Hey Childrenrsquos Hospital in Liverpool after the provincersquos paediatric pathologist retired as ldquoinhumane.She believes thatpriority was given to funding and enticement for the training of pathologists, post-mortems could continue to be carried out on a regional basis.In addition, Mrs Trainor believes the possibility of pathologists travelling to Northern Ireland periodically from England, Scotland, Wales and further afield could be considered.Addressing last weekrsquos meeting, Mrs Trainor described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral and argued health officials should have done more to continue the service, knowing that a senior pathologist was retiring.ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le, she said.ldquoYou will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child. For health officials to suggest that a child is wrapped up like a package and sent across the water for a post mortem is cruel.ldquoI am not sure what provision would be in place for parents to accompany the child, but to send them on such a journey is heartbreaking. The entire family circle suffers when something like this happens.Mrs Trainor said the decision to hold post-mortems in England was the ldquosingle, most horrying thing she has ever heard.She continued: ldquoThe health service never ceases to amaze me and once again due to a lack of foresight, planning and finance, we find ourselves in what is an unforgivable situation, she continued, commending Newry, Mourne and Down Council for recently highlighting the post mortem issue.ldquoI am not the only person who has lost a child, quite a few people have and there are those who would join me to meet with Mr Pengelly to explain that sending babies across the water for post mortem is just not acceptable.The health campaigner believes there must be a paediatric pathologist who is prepared to provide cover in Northern Ireland, admitting she would also be in favour of an all island service.ldquoSending babies away is not an option and while an all island option is better than sending babies to Liverpool, I believe we must have this service provided here, she declared. ldquoWe need to meet with the Permanent Secretary as soon as possible on this vital issue.Committee chairman Eamonn McGrady said it was his understanding that there were strains on pathology services across the province due to workforce issues.ldquoIssues like this happen over a period of time and you sometimes wonder just how much attention is given to the planning aspect, he said.ldquoHow do officials plan for the future  It is not just enough to commission a report on the issue and put it in the bottom drawer and announce you are several thousand nurses short when you have had ample opportunity over several years to train more.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, who attended last weekrsquos meeting in Downpatrick, said holding post-mortems in England ldquowill bring untold pain and suffering to families in their darkest hour.He added: ldquoWe must do everything within our power to try and bring a resolution to this resource issue including examining a North-South approach. Local people have sought a meeting with Department of Health officials on this matter and I will be happy to pursue and facilitate this.ldquoThere is a need for such a crucially important service for parents and indeed the wider family circle to be delivered regionally.Three weeks ago, local politicians called on the Permanent Secretary to reduce the ldquoalready enormous burden from parents suffering from bereavement and come up with a better solution than sending babies to Liverpool.Politicians said they were not averse to an all island service, insisting the reinstatement of the Belfast-based paediatric pathologist who retied is also vitally important moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New £217k play park welcome boost for Meadowlands estate  ","story":"MEADOWLANDS estate in Downpatrick is at last to get a new play park costing pound,.Work on the park should start within weeks and be ready by the end of March.A proposal to proceed with the scheme was approved by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee on Monday night.The new park is a joint project with the council and Downpatrick Neighbourhood Renewal with % funding from the Department of the Communities.The council will be responsible for managing its construction and its maintenance.The new park is to be located in front of Drumcloon Walk and adjacent to the Quoile Crescent housing development.According to the Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service statistics, Meadowlands is ranked th out of  areas of high health deprivation.The need for the park has also been supported by statistics from the Northern Ireland Research and Information Agency which show that there are  children under the age of  living in the Quoile Ward area who could avail of the park.It is also hoped that the park will help with the regeneration of the area and improve its overall look.The siting of the park was moved after some local concern was expressed that it would too close to pensionersrsquo homes in Drumcloon Park.Meadowlands Community Association, which was formed with help from local councillor Cadogan Enright, last week welcomed the move and the fact that the council listened to its representations.At Mondayrsquos meeting, Cllr Billy Walker proposed that the committee agree to go ahead with the park.He said: ldquoI really welcome this play park, as will the residents, he said. ldquoBeing the last chairman of the old district council, I know that a park for Meadowlands was a legacy issue.ldquoThere is real need for this as Meadowlands is one of the most deprived areas in the Downpatrick DEA and itrsquos to good see that that hard work is at last bearing fruit.Cllr Cadogan, who seconded the proposal, added: ldquoI am delighted that this play park can go ahead as I have been working with the residents for years and itrsquos at last getting over the line..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New amenity centre set for spring opening  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new ultra-modern civic amenity centre could open as early as the spring, council officials have confirmed.The new facility at Flying Horse Road will replace the existing centre at nearby Cloonagh Road, which continues to struggle with the increasing demands being placed upon it.Over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, the centre was forced to close early due to the volume of waste.The early closure annoyed many ratepayers with council officials confident the new centre mdash which is signicantly larger mdash will be able to handle more recyclable material.Over recent years, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has invested signicant sums building new civic amenity sites in Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with the Flying Horse Road facility set to be one of the most modern of its kind.Confirmation that the new Downpatrick centre could open as early as the spring will be given at this eveningrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.There was a delay in building the new facility as a suitable site could not be identied and when work did eventually get underway, progress was temporarily halted as equipment belonging to contractors was targeted by vandals.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed news then the new centre could open for business as early as the spring.The local authorityrsquos lease of the Cloonagh Road facility has been extended until the end of March but it has been recognised for some time that this facility has passed its sell-by-date.Cllr Curran said it was important Downpatrick had a recycling centre which was fit-for-purpose and could meet the needs of ratepayers across a wide area.He said the facility was not solely used by people in the town.

Screengrab taken from Parliament.tv January , First, the DUP managed to get Mrs May to do a U-turn on the backstop by saying that she would now try to renegotiate it, and then that was followed by the passage of an amendment by senior Tory backbencher Sir Graham Brady as part of that plan.By a majority of just , MPs voted in favour of Sir Graham’s amendment, which, unusually, the government whipped its MPs to support.During a night of dramatic votes on amendments from both Remainers and Brexiteers, the government managed to prevail in most of the key votes, albeit by slender margins.But the government narrowly lost one vote when it failed to prevent the passage of an amendment which opposed a no-deal Brexit. However, that vote is not binding on the government.There was a bullish response from both Dublin and Brussels, which insisted that the withdrawal agreement on offer to the UK would not be renegotiated.But the DUP’s  MPs were jubilant. Chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was reported to have punched the air as the vote was announced and Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said that it was “a signicant night because for the first time the House by a majority has expressed [support for] the sort of deal that will get through and will have a majority and we will work with the prime minister to deliver the right deal for the United Kingdom”.Sir Graham Brady’s amendment gives the prime minister a mandate to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement and replace the backstop with “alternative arrangements” to avoid a hard border in Ireland.The nature of those alternative arrangements is not entirely clear and was the subject of unsuccessful questioning from many MPs during yesterday’s debate, including from North Down MP Lady Hermon who was frustrated at the absence of clarity on the point.During the debate, Mrs May said that she was seeking a “signicant and legally binding change to the Withdrawal Agreement”.Mr Dodds welcomed Mrs May’s comment about the backstop, saying that she was “quite right to emphasise that as the primary problem” and that she could be “assured of our support”.The North Belfast MP told the Commons that the DUP was committed to not having a hard border on the island of Ireland but not at the expense of a border between Northern Ireland and GB.More snow on the way - Met Office issues weather warning for N.I. Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"There were rowdy scenes in the Commons after the SNP’s Westminster leader stood up after the vote was announced to repeatedly allege that the vote meant that the Tories had “effectively ripped apart the Good Friday Agreement”.Mr Dodds responded forcefully, saying that it was “quite frankly outrageous” and “utterly reckless” for the Scottish politician “to talk in those terms”.In response to the vote, the Irish governmentrepeated that the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for renegotiation.In a statement, it said that the EU position “has not changed”, with the agreement comprising “a carefully negotiated compromise, which balances the UK position on customs and the single market with avoiding a hard border and protecting the integrity of the EU customs union and single market. The best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal is to raty this agreement.”Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill urged both the Irish government and the EU to “stand firm against attempts to sabotage what has already been agreed”.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: “The rejection of the Irish backstop, the only viable mechanism to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, is an affront on the Good Friday Agreement.”try catch  TrendingDying single mother, , with motor neurone disease whose children have to dress her refused disability benefitsThese properties are just some of the least expensive currently up for sale in NISnow, ice and fallen debris could make your morning drive dficult - as Roads Service confirm salting of roads network underwayN.I. man headbutts police officer before spitting in nurses faceP.S.N.I. shutdown N.I. road after car crash - N.I.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come. It’s time to put prosperity before party politics and dogma.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Air-1.jpg","title":"eight part belfast made airbus passenger jets delivered","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Eight part-Belfast made Bombardier Airbus passenger jets were delivered at the end of last year – bringing the total number to  during .

I love the mutual ethos, and that we are fundamentally there to help the community,” she told Ulster Business.“We have to make a , but fundamentally we are there for the good of society. I passionately believe that home ownership is a good thing. And I passionately believe that savings are a good thing, and that’s what our business has been doing for more than  years.”According to its latest full-year figures, ending in December , Progressive posted pre-tax profit of £.m.In the last year, it helped more than , people buy their home and almost  to build a new home, with overall new mortgage lending of around £m.It’s weathered some of the most dficult years in the residential property market here, with Northern Ireland prices plummeting in the wake of the recession in .“We are battling our way through that – the housing market hasn’t fully recovered through it. The number of new developments probably aren’t servicing the needs of the demand. We still have an issue out there.“Slow, and modest growth is happening at the minute. But that’s good, and that’s sustainable. Affordability is very good in Northern Ireland and the economic factors, even with Brexit, are good.”Progressive now has  branches and more than  staff spread throughout Northern Ireland.For Darina, it’s about working hand-in-hand with the customer, and ensuring everyone in the team in the same mindset.“For me, it has to be doing right by the customer. Once your staff are fully on that journey too, they know they are doing the right thing,” Darina says. “They aren’t forced into sales targets – they want to get the right product fro the person, and making it as easy as they possibly can.“In part, to hand hold. There are some cases where deadlines don’t happen, things don’t go according to plans – for example, in a housing chain, someone can drop out. It’s about being there, and being able to help.“There is still a demand for people to buy houses – that hasn’t changed at all.”Darina took over at the helm in , while the property market in Northern Ireland, and throughout the UK, was still going through tough times. But she believes it has normalised since then.“Things are picking up,” she says. “We have the experience here to keep going in a direction that suits the demographic that we serve.“We are here for the long-term, and factor that in. Ultimately, it has to be right for the consumer.“It’s also about the whole of Northern Ireland. It’s not just Belfast-centric, and we have to extend our reach. There’s good activity in dferent parts of Northern Ireland, and that’s where our roots are.”And after more than  years with the organisation, Darina says she has no plans to jump ship to another financial business.“I am totally bought in to the mutual ethos. For me, it’s all about the customer.
