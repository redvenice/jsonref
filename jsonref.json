Which I understand.\u0027 He did not go into further detail about how he had hurt his ex, but he had warned earlier in the recording that: \u0027I will kill that b***h if she play with me.\u0027 According to Pitchfork, the recording was obtained from the Miami-Dade county state attorney\u0027s office, and was bad enough that both prosecutors and XXXTentacion\u0027s own defense lawyers were treating it as a confession.        The rapper\u0027s girlfriend Geneva Ayala posted a photo of her injuries from the alleged beating on Instagram at the time (pictured)He asked her to move in with him that night but just two weeks later, she says XXXTentacion  grabbed her phone and smashed it on the floor before striking her in the face after she admired one of her male friend\u0027s grills in a Snapchat video.\u0027I got slapped for no reason,\u0027 the Instagram model told theMiami New Times. \u0027And he kept acting like everything was cool.\u0027 She said he hit her again later that day, allegedly slapping her so hard that she became lightheaded. Then the rapper returned to the room with a barbecue fork and a wire barbecue brush and asked her: \u0027Which one do you want me to use?\u0027 \u0027He told me to pick between the two, because he was going to put one of them up my vagina,\u0027 she said during a deposition given to a prosecutor seven months later.  Alaya said the beatings only got worse when the couple moved to Orlando in June 2016.She told prosecutors that XXXTentacion beat hear every three to four days, choking her, pressing knives or scissors to her face, holding her head under water in the bathroom and promising to drown her.\u0027His favorite thing was just to backhand my mouth,\u0027 she told the Miami New Times. \u0027That always left welts inside my lips.\u0027      Prosecutors presented surveillance video evidence in the death of XXXTentacion that showed when co-defendants Michael Boatwright and Trayvon Newsome got out of their car carrying guns and killed the rapper at the wheel of his $150,000 BMW          A BMW sits idle after reports of a shooting in Deerfield Beach involving Broward rapper XXXTentacion on Monday, June 18Things reportedly came to a head on the morning of October 6, 2016. The couple had recently found out Ayala was pregnant and XXXTentacion was happy with the news. But that day he allegedly threatened to kill her and their unborn child. For 15 minutes, XXXTentacion allegedly \u0027punched, slapped, elbowed, strangled, and head-butted\u0027 Ayala, she told the police. Ayala said her eyes were leaking and she began to lose her vision as she started to vomit. But XXXTentacion forbade their roommates from taking her to the hospital. Instead he left her in a room for two days. She escaped while pretending to make him something to eat, running out of an open side door in the kitchen. XXXTentacion was arrested the next day and charged with aggravated battery on a pregnant victim, domestic battery by strangulation, false imprisonment, and witness tampering.But in November 2017, Ayala signed a document saying she would not testify against XXXTentacion in court. She claims she was forced to do it by the rapper because she was scared of his fans, who he would often invite to court appearances.            XXXTentacion performs during the second day of the Rolling Loud Festival in downtown Miami on Saturday, May 6, 2017  Music streaming service Spotify announced in May 2018 that it would stop promoting or recommending music by him and R\u0026ampB artist R. Kelly as they violated its hateful conduct policy.  This decision was later reversed however after the CEO of Top Dawg Entertainment Anthony Tiffith threatened to pull his label\u0027s music from the service. The popular rap star was fatally shot as he left a motorcycle dealership in Florida on June 18 in an armed robbery.His luxury car was blocked in the parking lot and two masked men, armed with guns, tried to steal his Louis Vuitton bag containing $50,000 in cash. A struggled ensued and the rapper was shot multiple times by one or more gunman, who took the bag and fled, police said. Dedrick Williams, 22 Michael Boatwright, 22 Trayvon Newsome, 20 and Robert Allen, 22, have been arrested and charged in connection with his murder.  XXXTentacion Confessed to Domestic Abuse and Other Violent Crimes in Newly Obtained Secret Recording | Pitchfork"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/25/05/519DA14F00000578-6314025-image-a-237_1540440796690.jpg","title":"Prince Harry Meghan Markle unveil statue hero British Fijian sergeant flying Tonga","story":"Rock a red dress like Meghan in Self-PortraitPre-order it hereSo far, they have visited Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, and today The Duke and Duchess of Sussex touched down in Tonga.

Maxine Waters and to former CIA director John Brennan via CNN’s HQ in New York – a building where I used to work.All of the recipients, as CNN itself was quick to note, have been openly critical of President Trump, and been regularly verbally attacked by Trump.Was that the reason they were sent ‘functional explosive devices’?Was that the terrorist’s primary motivation?Possibly.We’ll have to wait for the police and FBI to work that out.But let’s not pretend this couldn’t just as easily have been a left wing home grown nutcase targeting right-wing political figures.As I have regularly said, many liberals have been sent completely bonkers by Trump winning the White House and their behaviour has grown increasingly erratic and threatening.Only last week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was attacked in a restaurant as he ate dinner with his wife. His shrieking assailant grabbed McConnell’s to-go box from the table and dumped it outside on the sidewalk as other diners cheered.It was a very ugly, intimidating incident, and followed similar ones involving right-wing public figures.This morning, as it was being debated on Fox News, a pundit said: ‘My fear is that intimidation turns to violence.’Literally as he finished saying those words, one of the anchors announced the breaking news of the pipe bombs.You couldn’t have scripted a more ironic, or pertinent segway.And that’s what I mean when I say I’m not surprised by these pipe bombs.We could all sense during the recent frenzied and disturbing Kavanaugh Supreme Court nominee fiasco that partisan politics in America has got completely out of control.There’s no longer any attempt or pretence at fairness, nor any desire to come together for the greater good of the country.Instead, there’s just a constant seething rage on all sides that permeates every pore of political debate, fuelled by social media where everyone competes to shout loudest in their indignant, superior self-righteousness.This kind of rage inevitably leads to real violence, as we’ve seen today.Of course, because these pipe bombs were sent to Trump critics, many in the media are racing to pin all the blame squarely at the feet of the President.I’ll come to him in a moment, because he’s most definitely not blameless when it comes to whipping up violent thoughts.But there are others who should take a long hard look at themselves today too – starting with the accusing media.          Because these pipe bombs were sent to Trump critics, many in the media are racing to pin all the blame on the President. He’s most definitely not blameless, but there are others who should take a long hard look at themselves today too – starting with the accusing mediaI’ve been in LA for the past few days and watched a lot of cable news.It’s been wall-to-wall Trump, and in the cases of CNN and MSNBC, wall-to-wall sneering, mockery and open derision of the President.There’s a specific currency to perpetual Trump-bashing: it sells. Those who trade in it, from cable news networks to newspapers and late night shows, are making vast sums of money from spewing hateful negativity about the President.Now, let me be very clear: as a journalist, I don’t have an issue with Trump being criticised – he is a uniquely isive and polarising figure who flies loose with the truth and loves picking fights and saying or tweeting inflammatory things.As America’s leader, and the world’s most powerful man, Trump must be held to account for everything he says and does.But there has to be some balance too, doesn’t there?I’ve never seen any US president treated as badly as Trump is treated, and that cannot do anything but pour salt on the wounds of a bitterly ided country.Having said that, nor have I ever seen any US president use violent rhetoric as regularly as Trump does.From the moment he first ran as a presidential candidate in 2015, he’s used overtly inflammatory and threatening language.On the day of the Iowa caucuses, he told the crowd he’d pay their legal fees if they decided to ‘knock the crap’ out of protestors.At a Las Vegas rally a few weeks later, he berated security guards for being so soft on a heckler, saying: ‘I wanted to punch him in the face!’Last week, at a rally, he applauded Rep. Greg Gianforte’s physical attack on a journalist by saying: ‘Any guy who can do a body slam is my type!’This would be a bad enough presidential comment at any time, but for Trump to say it hours after it emerged that Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi had been murdered for criticising the Saudi regime, it was outrageous.Trump would argue that many media, Democrats and liberal celebrities constantly abuse and threaten him, and of course he’s right.Robert De Niro screamed ‘F*CK TRUMP’ from an awards show podium and has repeatedly said he wants to beat him up.Comedian Kathy Griffin posed with a severed Trump head for a pathetic photo stunt.Madonna, on the first Women’s March after Trump’s inauguration, said she dreamed of blowing up the White House.All of this nonsense (and we saw similarly unacceptable violent talk from the likes of Ted Nugent about Obama) has conspired to create an atmosphere of raw hatred and toxicity that is deeply damaging to America and I strongly suspect, to the psyche of American people.When someone feels so enraged by political discourse that they send deadly bombs to kill some of the most famous political figures in the country, something is horrifically wrong.When we’re not even surprised it’s happened, then it’s even more worrying.The violent rhetoric has got to stop before it drives more lunatics to do stuff like this.          The violent rhetoric has got to stop before it drives more lunatics to do stuff like this - and it needs to start at the top - with TrumpAnd for that process to begin, it has to start at the top – with Trump.So stop the violent trash-talk, Mr President.Words have meaning, and consequences.You’re not presiding over some fake WWE prime-time extravaganza.You’re President of the United States of America, a great country full of hundreds of millions of very real people living very real lives and relying on you to improve the quality of those lives.But it’s never seemed less ‘United’ and you have it in your power to do something about that.I urge you to do so.You will never Make America Great Again if you can’t unite it."},{"url":null,"title":"Im sorry Sainsburys unexpected item want bagging area dildo","story":"    The Aura Silver Vibrator and Massager is on sale for £15.00How could they do it? My local branch of J Sainsbury is reliable and friendly, packed with pensioners taking their grandchildren for chips in the café and a big bag of sweets. Now, safe (and - let\u0027s be honest- boring) J Sainsbury have decided to \u0027move\u0027 with the times and get on board the Fifty Shades bandwagon.Sainsbury was always reassuringly middle class and safe - certainly not somewhere I\u0027d encounter a dildo at the checkout.Forget dinky sprouts, miniature new potatoes, and (this is as exciting as it gets in the Sainsbury grocery department) Rose Harissa for a Moroccan inspired stew, discriminating shoppers can now purchase a pulsating plastic gizmo designed to bring women to orgasm in record time.You could opt for the Rose Gold Bullet at £8, which operates at 7 different speeds or splash out and spend £15 on the Aura Silver Vibrator, described as \u0027suitable for couples\u0027.In our gender-fluid world, exactly where this large silvery bomb-shaped device might be inserted is left to the imagination - in fact, it looks a little bit like a lava lamp.I had no idea the store\u0027s directors were more interested in spicing up my love life than my curries.          J Sainsbury have decided to \u0027move\u0027 with the times and get on board the Fifty Shades bandwagon (stock image)Unlike over-priced smug Waitrose (where you can get over 50 kinds of designer tea, red chicory and wild rice), Sainsbury customers want value for money, no frills and a decent choice.The \u0027gourmet ingredients\u0027 section sometimes seems a bit of an afterthought, but the oaty biscuits from the gluten-free range are delicious and there\u0027s a decent choice of wine under a tenner.My only gripe has been their obsession with rearranging the shop floor. From August, Halloween costumes and Christmas crackers are on display alongside sun tan lotion, even though the festive season is months away.\u0027I swear it wasn\u0027t me!\u0027: David Schwimmer films himself in a...Angry shoppers slam Poundland for selling £1 Halloween...Share this articleWe have to navigate around special offers - bins of cheap stain removing powder, and piles of barbecues the minute the sun pokes out.Every week, the layout goes through a massive re-design, kitchenware and cleaning products swap places, yoghurt migrates to the end of aisle D and (without any warning) toilet rolls get moved next to wine.There is some kind of mad logic emanating from mission control at Sainsbury HQ - but in spite of these hurdles, my weekly shop is accomplished with the minimum of fuss. I wish they would hand out maps of the new layout, but at least it means I can chat to a personable young man and ask for help.          The Rose Gold Bullet (£8.00) is now on saleWhy does Sainsbury need to flog us dildos? It\u0027s not like there\u0027s a crying need, you can\u0027t go online without being inundated with ads for the things.There are Ann Summers shops up and down the country and even Poundland sells a vibrator for £1 - although it doesn\u0027t offer all the speeds of the pearly pinky gold Sainsbury bullet.Sex is everywhere these days- get on a train or a bus and you\u0027ll get a glimpse of writhing flesh on a fellow passenger\u0027s phone. Middle aged businessmen sit hunched over their laptops on long distance train journeys, watching porn on the free wifi, pretending they are looking at spread sheets and writing important emails.They are not fooling me. I want free internet access on public transport to have every porn site blocked. And we wonder why young men are obsessed with porn - and supermarkets are selling vibrators alongside cake mix.Buying a dildo doesn\u0027t mean your sex life will improve, in spite of the laughable claim from the J Sainsbury boss that purchasing a pink plastic bullet shaped object will \u0027increase the nation\u0027s sense of well-being\u0027. He said \u0027we want to help our customers live well for less\u0027. That implies that choosing a vibrator is just like choosing a burger or a chipolata sausage, opting for a stuffed chicken over a pack of meaty thighs.The store says \u0027by introducing a new range at affordable prices, we hope to give customers the option to buy quickly and conveniently in an environment they feel comfortable with\u0027.          The Rose Blush Bullet (£12.00) is also on saleEvery single part of that statement is laughable. How many men or women would feel comfortable saying \u0027I\u0027m just popping down to Sainsbury for a vibrator?\u0027Or feel comfortable popping it onto the conveyor belt at the check-out.Is a sex toy really top of our priorities - when what we want is lower grocery bills?Online, the Sainsbury web site seems a little confused, offering the chance to \u0027buy sexual enhancement and toys with the same great quality, freshness and choice you\u0027d find in store\u0027…and you can book a one hour delivery slot. What happens if your choice is not available? Will we have to discuss substitutions with the delivery person?Sainsbury say that one in three Brits are not happy with their sex lives - was it ever any different? Why does a grocery store need to morph into a relationship expert? Why do they think a vibrator is the answer to every woman\u0027s prayer?The people who stand to lose most from this misjudged sales initiative are men. Once women realize that a vibrator with seven speeds doesn\u0027t snore, doesn\u0027t roll over and fall asleep after a couple of minutes\u0027 activity, doesn\u0027t fizzle out (especially if you have a decent supply of batteries) and doesn\u0027t ask if you\u0027ve put on weight, they will be marching off the shelves.Sainsbury might think they are being helpful, but in fact the reverse is true. Once Vibrators are as common as fish fingers and frozen peas, the writing is on the wall for men. In future, they will have limited use as sperm banks.You have been warned. "},{"url":null,"title":"ALEX BRUMMER ugly stand Italy EU proves exactly voted leave","story":"    The EU has declared war on Italy\u0027s democratically elected government led by Giuseppe Conte (pictured) This is a power struggle certain to have strong resonance for Brexiteers striving to break away from Brussels’ vast, unaccountable bureaucracy.At the heart of Italy’s arm wrestle with the Commission are promises made by the two populist parties during this year’s election. They pledged to lift the yoke of Brussels austerity, which has delivered economic disaster in Greece, and threatens to do the same in Italy. And these are no idle boasts from Italy’s firebrand leaders: the Commission is playing a dangerous game because Italy – the third largest economy in the single currency – has the potential to play havoc with the stability of the eurozone.The uncertainty has already sent shivers through the market in Italian government bonds – essentially a measure of the faith international markets have in a country’s economic stability.\u0027It wasn\u0027t a lion\u0027s den, it was more like a petting zoo\u0027:...Labour would cost every family £35,000 May blasts as Corbyn...Tory MP Andrew Bridgen accuses No 10 of making up threats to...Share this articleThere is certainly an argument to be made that the Italian leadership is being unwise in its economic plans. Under the proposed Italian budget, taxes would be cut, spending on the poorest in society would be increased and the state would lower the retirement age.The problem, of course, is that while such measures might appeal to voters, someone has to pay for them, and already the Italian government has the second highest level of national debt in relation to national output inside the EU at 130 per cent of gross domestic product.Yet in the past, Italy has found it relatively easy to run big budget deficits and a large national debt because of the willingness of citizens and the country’s economic institutions to hold large amounts of government debt.          Mario Monti (pictured) had never held any elected office and was charged with implementing an austerity programme The bottom line is that whatever you think of the Italian proposals, it is deeply worrying for Brussels to threaten a sovereign nation over its spending plans.This is not the first time the EU has sought to take control of the Italian economy. After the convulsions in euroland in 2010, the EU insisted that Italy appointed one of its own, a former European commissioner, Mario Monti, as prime minister.A Brussels technocrat, Monti had never held any elected office. He was charged with implementing an austerity programme which has now contributed to Italy’s jobless rate of 9.7 per cent (more than twice the UK’s 4 per cent), and a shocking youth unemployment level of 31 per cent of the workforce.Such appalling unemployment is one of the main reasons Italians turned to anti-Brussels populist parties at the ballot box. So who is going to win this shoot-out? In a budget fight with Italy, Brussels and Frankfurt – home of the European Central Bank (ECB) – must believe they have the upper hand. Recent data from the German-dominated ECB shows that Italy’s banking and financial system is being propped up by almost half a trillion euros (£424billion) of short-term loans, at a time when the German government is one trillion euros (£885billion) in credit. The scale of those Italian debts to Europe’s central bank gives its partners in the single currency great leverage over its affairs, yet the confrontation looks certain to revive anti-euro sentiment in Italy.There will be renewed demands from Italians to leave the eurozone, restore the lira as a national currency and take control over its own destiny.With global markets teetering thanks to Donald Trump’s trade war on China, the current impasse could not come at a worse moment for the eurozone. Yet Brussels is demonstrating that for its unelected officials blind ideology still overrides democracy. And you wonder why Britain voted to leave."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/25/05/519DA14F00000578-6314025-image-a-237_1540440796690.jpg","title":"Prince Harry Meghan Markle unveil statue hero British Fijian sergeant flying Tonga","story":"Rock a red dress like Meghan in Self-PortraitPre-order it hereSo far, they have visited Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, and today The Duke and Duchess of Sussex touched down in Tonga.

The handmade red flowers at St Peter Mancroft Church in Norwich represent each fallen soldier named on a war memorial in the county  Local brownie and scout groups also made dozens of the flowers, while others came from as far afield as the United StatesSarah Salmon, who works for the local authority and organised the display, said: \u0027A lot of them have come in with family history stories, which is nice.\u0027Somebody said the best thing was, even though they were following a pattern, each of the poppies is unique, just like the soldiers, and I think that\u0027s a really fitting tribute.\u0027Many of the poppies have been made from recycled materials by knitting and crocheting groups based in Norfolk\u0027s libraries.Local brownie and scout groups also made dozens of the flowers, while others came from as far afield as the United States.  St Peter Mancroft Church in Norwich (left) and a similar display in Nailsworth, Gloucestershire, (right) where a clock tower was wrapped in 10,000 poppies knitted by locals        Emily Dawes, pictured left, and far right, provoked outrage when she referred to the university\u0027s Rotherstein Mural as a \u0027mural of white men\u0027             Her comments refer to this mural, which depicts an unknown soldier from the First World War being awarded a degree. Local history enthusiasts have asked that it not be damagedBoth she and the students\u0027 union have since apologised for her comments after she was accused of abusing the free speech the soldiers fought and died to protect.The Rothenstein Mural was painted in 1916 \u0027as a memorial to members of the British universities serving in the Great War\u0027.\u0027It depicts an academic procession and the conferring of a degree on an unknown soldier,\u0027 according to the university.Lucy Carter, the granddaughter of mural artist Sir William Rothenstein, said of Ms Dawes\u0027s comments: \u0027I think it\u0027s very sad, people trying to change history.              The University of Southampton Students\u0027 Union President Emily Dawes has provoked anger with this tweet threatening to paint over a First World War memorial            She also posted this tweet, suggesting she understood the significance of the mural\u0027It\u0027s sad that people should be overtaken by these concerns. Painting over it would be unnecessary.\u0027Southampton MP Royston Smith, who served in the RAF for ten years, said the SU president\u0027s tweet was \u0027disappointing\u0027 considering the soldiers were defending the free speech which she was exercising.He said: \u0027With freedom comes responsibility, and considering the President of the SU holds a position of authority she has clearly overstepped the mark.\u0027I hope she will reflect on what she has said and realise it has been conducted in poor taste. Those who know the history of our island are fully aware and appreciate the involvement of black and Asian soldiers against tyranny.\u0027 The university\u0027s Conservative Association called for Ms Dawes to face disciplinary action and said the mural should be protected from potential vandalism. After she was criticised today, Ms Dawes released a statement saying: \u0027Firstly, and most importantly, I would like to apologise for the offense and upset I have caused with what I have said.             Her comments have provoked anger from many in the city, who pointed out the bravery of those who fought and died in the First World War\u0027I never meant to the disrespect to anyone past, present and future. \u0027I had no intention of the tweet being taken literally, and upon reflection have realised how inappropriate it was.\u0027My intention was to promote strong, female leadership and not the eradication and disrespect of history. I do not believe that to make progress in the future, we should look to raise the past.\u0027The controversial Twitter post was not the only tweet she aimed at the memorial. She had earlier tweeted a picture of the wall, with the expletive-ridden message: \u0027ONE OF THE WOMEN JUST SAID \u0027it\u0027s nearly armistice day so are we covering up this tapestry??\u0027 AND HOLY S***.

It\u0027s also reversing the cuts inflicted on our community by the Conservatives over the last eight hard years of austerity.\u0027Eight years of Tory austerity have undermined much of the social fabric of our society and is putting our future at risk. \u0027Faced with this scale of damage inflicted on our community, we need decisive action to end and reverse austerity, not some vague promises for the future and a few financial conjuring tricks.\u0027Mr McDonnell warned that a \u0027temporary bodge\u0027 over Brexit would do nothing to ease the concerns of investors worried about the lack of economic certainty.He said Mr Hammond - seen as the leading supporter in the Cabinet of a business-friendly \u0027soft Brexit\u0027 - had to take his share of the blame for the problems in the negotiations.\u0027His failure to stand up to the fanatical no-dealers in Cabinet and in his own party makes him as culpable as the Prime Minister for this unholy mess that is putting our economy at risk,\u0027 he said.\u0027It is no use him trying to stand on the sidelines, throwing out the occasional statistical analysis from the Treasury, when it was him who was among the first to publicly threaten a no deal.

We have said what we would do is we would have a fair taxation system and that will enable us to fund the public services because we cannot go on the way we are,\u0027 he said.\u0027It will require increasing taxes.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, EstelleMoon, who has had a disappointingly fulfilling experience:Well, as much as I’d like to say I’ve been reading something esoteric and obscure, no, I’ve been reading something incredibly popular. And as much as I’d like to say that the popular thing is overrated and bad, no, in fact, it turns out it’s incredibly popular and incredibly good.I’m talking about Elena Ferrante. I finished My Brilliant Friend a couple of days ago, and I’m now about 100 pages into Volume 2 of her Neapolitan Quartet, The Story of a New Name. They’re so vivid and rich when it comes to detailing this beautiful, frustrating and profound friendship between Elena and Lila, full of love, full of competition, full of resentment, full of life. But they’re also a portrait of a community, of a country coming from fascism, they’re about the urge to break away from the stifling world you grew up in, they’re about masculinity, about family, about politics and so much more – but all these heady themes emerge in the best way possible – ie, organically, through the story and the lives of Elena and Lila.Oh well. Elsewhere, julian6 has enjoyed Mario Vargas Llosa’s early book, The Time of the Hero:This account of the daily struggles and cruelties at a military academy in Peru has sharply etched characters and wonderfully economical descriptive work. Llosa plays with time sequences throughout, moving back and forth, slowly drawing out the painful life journeys of his characters. It is clear-eyed, unsentimental and unfailingly honest, showing its vulnerable, petty, vindictive but not entirely irredeemable protagonists in a raw uncompromising light. The translation brought out the fluency of phrasing, the choice vocabulary. These narrators - for there are many viewpoints in this work, as well as third person - know their world intimately. I was drawn in from the beginning. The sympathy that emerged was never pleaded for or crudely awakened. There is nothing cheap in Llosa’s vision - it is a naked portrayal of diminished lives caught in an unforgiving web of poverty, prejudice and pitiless power structures.A second reading of Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman has impressed Ieuan:Very similar to War and Peace (which was its inspiration – and of similar length and complexity). The manuscript was confiscated by the KGB upon writing and Grossman was told it couldn’t be published for ‘at least 200 years’. A copy was smuggled to the west in the 1980s and published here. It was hailed a masterpiece and (IMHO), it is.The Power by Naomi Alderman gets a nod from koelner:I just finished reading and it absolutely blew me away. I didn’t necessarily agree with how things developed (ie that it would really work out like that if it happened in real life) but it was just so clever, especially the letters between authors at the end. I finished it and immediately had the urge to write an essay on it like back when I was in school. I mean, I didn’t, but there was just so much to think about and comment on and discuss. It really fired my imagination. It would be such a good book to study at school. Really enjoyed it.Meanwhile, The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene has worked for scoopster35:Greene puts you exactly in his world – peasant Mexico, in this case – with no fuss, no flowery prose, just hard, clear, vivid writing.RedmonT recommends The End of Vandalism by Tom Drury:It’s hilarious. Rare indeed that I laugh out loud from a book but I have done several times already. There’s something tragic about it, too.Here’s paulburns on Richard Flanagan’s Death of a River Guide:During an expedition down the Franklin River in northwest Tasmania, Aljaz Cosini, the expedition’s guide, drowns in an attempt to rescue a punter who has fallen into the raging rapids. As he drowns he recalls not only his own life, but the lives of several generations of his relatives, one of whom is a Tasmanian Aborigine. (For those who don’t know, Tasmanian Aborigines are a different type of indigenous people to the mainland Indigenous Australians), and another a convict, whose relatives are ashamed of the ‘convict stain’. At the same time, Flanagan writes in detail and lovingly of travelling down the Franklin River (not the safest thing in the world to do) in a journey beset by tragedy. This is a fine, beautifully written book.I am reading Harry Potter again, this time with my grandson. He is the same age his mum was when the first book was published,when we found it in the library, well before it became A Thing.

The flats had cost around £60,000 each in 2013 and were all rented to residents claiming housing benefit. The company was prosecuted for licensing offences.The discovery of the building’s story – described as “shocking” by two local MPs – has prompted calls for some landlords to have their properties seized and housing benefit rental payments withheld.When environmental health officers inspected the block in April 2016, 11 out of the 13 flats that were later the focus of the prosecutions were owned by overseas investors – based as far away as Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Malaysia.The investigations by the council discovered “hazards of excess cold”, and showed that Elite had failed to obtain licences on the properties it was letting on behalf of its international clients.Elite was prosecuted 13 times for the licensing offences, giving the tower the most convictions under the Housing Act of any building in England and Wales last year, according to freedom of information requests made by the  and ITV News.Frank Field, the independent MP for nearby Birkenhead and chairman of the work and pensions committee, said: “It is deeply shocking and depressing isn’t it? I think it is another example of the weak underbelly of globalisation, where the government is defenceless in trying to defend tenants.”Field said some landlords should have their property confiscated: “This is not just an isolated case. We have therefore got to build up an armoury to protect tenants in the weakest position. That includes withholding housing benefit from landlords and withdrawing their right to own and manage the property. Is it so shocking that these people should lose control over their property?”Dame Louise Ellman, the Labour MP who represents the constituency in which Mill View is located, said: “It’s shocking. It needs some kind of national legislation to stop this taking place.”Joe Beswick, head of housing at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, described the fact that housing benefit has become an international investment opportunity, offering guaranteed returns, as absurd.“The offshoring of the private rented sector is just another layer of absurdity,” he said. “From a relatively stable housing system where the government provided homes for people that couldn’t access them through the market … we’ve now gone to an unregulated system where rents are much higher because UK property has become such an attractive asset to international investors.”Beswick added: “A lot of those rents are finding their way into offshore accounts with, presumably, a higher level of tax avoided on taxpayers’ money.”Mill View, he said, proved that the involvement of international investors in the UK property market – and the problems it had caused – were not confined to London.“The worst thing about it is that while the money is being ploughed in, it is not in any way productive. Investors’ money is not being used to build more affordable homes, it is just being used to buy existing assets. It just increases the competition for homes and increases the cost of homes, with the people of the UK ending up with more expensive houses and no increase in the supply of houses.”Darren Sharkey, the director of Elite, claimed that he did not feel he needed a licence and that the licensing system penalised good landlords but had been unsuccessful in removing “very many rogue landlords”.He claimed that costs such as the ground rents paid by the landlords meant that owning a Mill View flat was not as profitable as it appeared.“We served improvement notices and as a direct result many have had work carried out – and we will continue to enforce the notices to make sure the remainder are done. This is exactly why we introduced landlord licensing”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5adb6d895e904fd398940d5dbb4a0e0042169a89/0_7_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd58fad92cc188d7087607875f41548e","title":"debenhams in decline what has gone wrong","story":"The retailer is grappling with formidable challenges such as high rents and online shoppingDebenhams has crashed to an annual loss of nearly £500m and confirmed plans to close almost a third of its stores.

Theresa May has pledged to give tenants access to the government’s new rogue landlord database after the  and ITV News investigation revealed that not a single name had been entered into the system in more than six months since its launch – and that even when landlords’ names were listed, the public would not be allowed to see them.In an interview with the , John McDonnell said: “Landlord licensing is not fit for purpose and the problem of rogue landlords is extensive. We need an effective scheme, local authorities that are properly resourced and improved tenants’ rights.“We are running a consultation to consolidate the powers available to local authorities and I would be in support of a national licensing scheme, in order to make regulation consistent for all landlords across the country and to stop the rogues from switching local authorities.” and ITV News investigation showed how rogue owners are collecting rents – often funded by taxpayers via housing benefit – despite being convicted of housing offences and failing to pass the “fit and proper” person tests required by housing legislation in England and Wales.Because of the way the law is written – with the tests applying on a borough-by-borough basis – this is usually perfectly legal. It allows landlords to be banned in one borough and operate in another.Landlord licensing came in as part of the the Housing Act, which came into force in 2006 and applies to England and Wales. Under that legislation landlords must be considered “fit and proper” to be issued with a licence.McDonnell’s comments have been echoed by experts in the sector, who in some cases have been calling for a complete overhaul of housing law.“We should consider introducing a national landlord registration scheme that could support and complement local licensing schemes by making it easier for local authorities to identify criminal landlords, while recognising the need for locally-led enforcement.Until 2013, licensing typically applied to landlords renting out houses in multiple occupation (HMO). An HMO is a property with at least three people who are not from a single household but share facilities such as a toilet and kitchen. In England and Wales, a “large HMO” – with at least five people from more than one household who share facilities – must be licensed.Selective schemes, under which local authorities can require landlords to have a licence no matter what type of property they were renting out, began to be introduced from 2013.However, they vary hugely from local authority to local authority. There are currently 44 local authorities in England and Wales with selective licensing schemes running. Of those, only four cover the whole of the borough in which they are enacted, according to the property technology company GetRentr."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfa0411b0e4628144a2fa7da777ae5c572e1c473/0_395_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfa2525afed13798da16d4df1c67810d","title":"weloveatl how instagram fell in love with atlanta in pictures","story":"A hashtag that started as a way of promoting local photographers has become a movement of love for the city, with over a million postsAtlanta lives on Instagram as #weloveatl, a hashtag started by three local photographers in 2012 to corral shots of the city on social media for a photography exhibition at Young Blood Gallery.

With no mountains or coastline to limit the city during the postwar boom, it just kept growing. A few years ago, “the city in a forest” and its surrounds ranked as the most sprawling large metropolitan area in the country.Many of the 5.5 million people in metropolitan Atlanta live in low-density single family houses “outside the perimeter”, the eight-lane concrete ring of Interstate 285. With few sidewalks and virtually no public transit, living in this vast sprawl means driving to work or school, driving to get dinner or meet friends, driving to shops and healthcare – if you can afford a car, that is. Another 2.5 million people are projected to move to the metropolitan area over the next 20 years.Atlanta, though, has an opportunity to change. The BeltLine – a 22-mile ring of abandoned and active freight rail lines that is being slowly transformed into a transit and trails loop – offers the city a different possible future. Parts of it have already been turned into walking and cycling paths, with new restaurants, bars and homes popping up along it. Just last month, the politan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) agreed $570m funding for light rail along 15 miles of the route.The vast scale and coverage of the BeltLine – it takes in 45 neighborhoods, from some of the richest to some of the poorest – means it has the potential to shape the city in a far more profound way than similar schemes such as New York’s High Line. Get it right and a large part of Atlanta can look forward to a future of high-density housing and walkable neighbourhoods, of cycling and public transit – and other American cities could have a new 21st century model to follow.But the chances of getting it wrong are high. People who have lived in poorer, traditionally black areas to the south and west are being forced out as speculation drives prices beyond their reach. The visionary urban designer who came up with the original idea has already resigned in protest. All eyes are on what happens right now.The BeltLine is not a new idea. Ryan Gravel came up with the concept of turning the freight rail corridor into a transit loop while a masters student at Georgia Tech in the late 1990s.Gravel spent his early life in Chamblee, just inside the I-285. The old town had been swallowed by suburban growth in the 60s and 70s and turned into a world of cars and malls. Growing up, he rarely ventured into the central city, but a student exchange trip to Paris opened his eyes to the heady freedoms made possible by public transit connections and walkable neighborhoods. The vision of the BeltLine was born.Over many years, what started as a masters thesis was taken up by enthusiastic advocates and local politicians. The idea evolved to include a walking and cycling trail, and formal bodies such as Atlanta BeltLine Incorporated were established to press for its development.The first major section of walking and cycling trail opened in 2012. Paid for with private funds, the 14ft-wide ribbon of car-free concrete winds for 2.5 miles through Atlanta’s Eastside. The neglected, historically white neighbourhoods by the trail had already started to come up – evidenced by the conversion of the old Ford Factory into loft apartments – but the BeltLine really kickstarted development.The derelict Sears warehouse was transformed into Ponce City Market, home to gourmet restaurants and boutique shops, office space and apartments. The eateries and stalls of Krog Street Market opened in 2014.Sitting by the side of the trail with Gravel last week, it is clear he is proud of what has been achieved. We are passed by a constant stream of people: joggers and cyclists, dog walkers and parents pushing buggies. Some children walk and cycle to two schools just off the trail. Millennials zip by on the electric share scooters that now dot Atlanta.It is a popular new social space in a city with no waterfront. A lucky few live along the line but the Eastside Trail has become a destination – a place people drive to, unload dogs or bikes, ride or stroll a couple of miles up and down, meet friends for dinner or coffee, and then drive home.Gravel hopes that over time fewer people will need to drive in, as the area around the BeltLine densifies and multistory parking lots are demolished to make way for more apartments, shops, restaurants and offices – but he is glad they are here.“The BeltLine is bringing them in and they wouldn’t have been in the city otherwise,” he says. “They are spending money inside Atlanta and they are going home with a new appreciation of what’s happening here. It’s changing how they think about the city. It might change how they want to live.”An outlay of $500m (£390m) of mostly public BeltLine money has generated $4bn in private investment, with a further $4bn (£3.1bn) planned or proposed. New developments are springing up all along the Eastside, with developers tempting potential buyers with glossy billboards promising “BeltLine living today”, electric car charging points and the ability to “walk to shops and restaurants”. One under-construction development has townhouses starting at $1.2m (£930,000).I meet Angel Poventud, an enthusiastic cheerleader and long-time activist for the BeltLine, who offers to tour me around the complete loop, including the abandoned and active rail sections. It’s not strictly legal.We start on the Eastside, where he is greeted by about half the people we pass. When we spot a group of schoolchildren on a bike tour, the teacher stops us and appears mildly starstruck – the class saw him in a promo video last week. Poventud gives them an impromptu talk and we’re off to the Southside.Unlike the Eastside, which was abandoned decades ago, freight trains operated on the Southside section until a few years back. The city bought this four miles of land from freight rail company CSX last year and are hopeful of securing federal funding in December. If successful, they hope to start the Southside Trail by 2020. The MoreMARTA transport plan, agreed last month, may part-fund light rail in this section but more money is needed.We nip past the “keep out” signs and cycle along the sandy trail where workers are busy tearing up the old track. Being a freight line, this section doesn’t connect with the communities around it – instead it either rides high above houses on an embankment, or is hidden down below in a cutting.There are no access points yet, but that will change – and when it does so will the neighborhoods along this south side, some of the most neglected in Atlanta.As we reported earlier this week, bright-yellow advertisements announcing “We buy houses” already hang on nearly every utility pole and tree, posted by home flippers looking to make a quick profit as prices swell.Soon we are on the Westside Trail – three miles from Pittsburgh to Bankhead, another troubled area.In Mark Pendergrast’s book City on the Verge, Poventud recounts the story of a young black boy he encountered during construction of the Westside Trail who asked him who it was for – white people or black people. “I told him it was for everyone,” he adds.The Westside Trail opened as a walking and cycling path last year. Federal money paid for this section and, unlike the cheaper construction of the Eastside, it is “transit ready” and features numerous access ramps, security cameras and lighting.The trail becomes impassable with kudzu weeds after we reach the edge of Azalea Gardens – a neglected estate that will no doubt be demolished to make way for the trail and transit. The windows of two blocks are boarded up. A few people sit on their front steps, watching the world go by. We hear a staccato series of bangs in the distance, starting a debate on the street – “Fireworks or gunshots?” – until a man comes past confirming the latter.Rent here is cheap, but it is not officially designated as affordable. Where will these people go when the site is inevitably redeveloped?The BeltLine’s original tax funding arrangement meant 5,600 units built along the route had to be affordable – but the reality is nowhere near that. Gravel resigned from the board of the Atlanta BeltLine Partnership in protest in 2016. “They had a target of 5,600 and they built 785,” he says. “About a third of those have now expired and are market rate. It’s terrible.”He wants to see developers provide more affordable housing and pushed to come up with better designs and more environmentally sustainable homes.“We’ve been giving everything away for too long,” he argues. “We need to demand more. Now we have market forces behind us we don’t need to incentivize growth – we need to hold that growth to higher standards.”Plans were announced last month for 120 affordable homes in the renovation of the 1940s Capitol View complex in Adair Park. Higgs says he would love to ensure Azalea Gardens contains affordable housing – and that the ABI might buy the land and partner with a not-for-profit developer – but nothing has been decided. If a developer builds properties for sale, then they don’t have to include any affordable housing at all.“Affordable units are part of the discussion, but that’s not the be all and end all,” he adds. “We want legacy residents to get opportunities. I think it’s going to be a positive thing but we need all the elements to be effective – we need the transit, the trail and the economic development. If we grow the pie, then residents of these areas have the opportunity for stronger incomes.”A few days later I meet Poventud again to complete the loop along the active freight rail line, where he hopes future light rail will go. The walking and cycling trail will take a different route, on the other side of Peachtree Creek and along quiet streets.In his day job as a train driver and engineer he rides this line every week, hauling lumber and steel, cement and chemicals out east to Athens and Gainesville. Some trains have 100 cars, a mile long or more, but he believes the line is underused.“It’s a 100ft-wide right of way and we’re using 12 feet. We could be doing a lot more with what we have here. Because the trail takes a different route we could keep the freight active, and run light rail transit alongside.“We have Piedmont Hospital on this stretch and it is one of the biggest employers on the BeltLine. Thousands of people work there and they have to rely on cars or infrequent buses. The rail line would give the workers and patients options.“It’s the last piece of the jigsaw – and possibly the hardest piece – but it’s what everybody is focusing on now. We’ve got to close the loop. When it is complete you can come in at any point, and go out in any direction. It’s key to the system.”“The issue is how we manage this change,” says Gravel. “There are lots of tools available – affordable housing, zoning, other strategies – we know what we should do, but we’re not doing it. There is a lot of support for affordable housing in this city but politics means it is not happening.“But the answer cannot be to not improve things. The answer cannot be to not provide transit and trails and green spaces, or develop schools and regenerate neighbourhoods.”After almost 20 years working to deliver his BeltLine vision, Gravel admits to being frustrated by the pace of progress. But he sees it as a generational change.“The BeltLine is about building a future city,” he adds. “Transit is for everybody. It’s the part that gets people to jobs. I think when the transit is running, then all the people who currently don’t get it, will get it.“And another 2.5 million people are going to come to the 20-county metro region by 2040. That’ll be 8 million people. Where do you want them to live? Do you want them to live in a suburb, where the only way to get around is to drive? The need for transit will be bigger than ever. It’s about what sort of city we want.” Cities is live in Atlanta for a special series of in-depth reporting.

Around the table are four technologists: one just launched a lesbian dating app another recently exited his first startup and is working on a second the other two are freelance full stack developers with packed portfolios.That might sound like a scene straight out of Silicon Valley, but we’re in Atlanta, at the black-owned “next-generation private membership club” called The Gathering Spot.Here, the startup ecosystem is a photo negative of the glaringly white tech scene in the San Francisco bay area. Everyone around the table is black, and as an added bonus, instead of the kombucha and spa water of Silicon Valley’s ubiquitous WeWorks, this coworking space has a full bar and table service.“This is the place,” says Barry Givens, an entrepreneur and engineer who founded the robotic bartender company Monsieur and is currently working on a company that will connect affluent African Americans with opportunities to invest in startups. “You have the money, the skill-set. If there was a Wakanda, this is it.”Indeed, with its burgeoning talent pool from area universities, significant social infrastructure thanks to a long-established black upper middle class, and a bumper crop of up-and-coming entrepreneurs, Atlanta’s black tech community feels poised to break out.Iziah Reid, founder of the local software development company NuraCode, compares the evolution of Atlanta’s black tech scene to its hip hop scene, recalling a time when local rappers were still trying to imitate the sound of successful artists from Los Angeles and New York.“Atlanta rap didn’t become a thing until they stopped imitating everyone else and went, ‘Hey, the south got something to say,’” Reid says. “Hopefully we’re the OutKast of black tech.”It wasn’t always like this. Paul Judge, whom several techies described as one of the “godfathers” of the Atlanta tech scene, recalled the early, dry years of trying to garner respect from Silicon Valley investors over lunch at Bytes, a local gastropub where the food is southern, the menus are iPads, and the location is perfect for the engineers and entrepreneurs of Georgia Tech, one of the highest ranked public universities in the US.Judge argues that Atlanta is poised to compete with Boston, Los Angeles, and New York to fill out the US’s top three tech cities behind Silicon Valley, thanks to its airport (“I can leave here at 10am and be at a lunch meeting in San Francisco,” he boasts), bevy of Fortune 500 corporations and concentration of engineering talent – in addition to Georgia Tech, the city is home to Georgia State University, Emory and the historically black colleges and universities Morehouse, Spelman and Clark Atlanta.But in the early 2000s, Judge says, investors would hear that a company was from Atlanta and immediately say, “No.” By 2007 or 2008, the investors might take a meeting, but they would demand that the company relocate to California.“Now they’re saying, ‘We’ll come to you.’”That shift was apparent on the morning of 19 October, when a bus full of Silicon Valley venture capitalists stopped by the offices of digitalunided, an incubator for startups founded by black and Latina women. The investors were part of the second “Comeback City Tour”, a scouting trip for VCs looking for investment opportunities beyond the Bay Area. The contrast between the black and brown women founders on one side of the room and the mostly white, mostly male venture capitalists on the other was striking, but the pitches were impressive and the conversation warm.“There’s like five businesses I want to hear more about,” enthused Rob Hayes, a partner at First Round Capital, a seed stage venture firm that boasts an early investment in Uber. “Atlanta is amazing! Why have I not been here?”The answer to that question is left unspoken, but to black entrepreneurs in Atlanta, it’s glaringly obvious. Several have tested the waters of the white-dominated tech scenes in Silicon Valley or New York, and chosen to settle in Atlanta.“We go there, we feel excluded, we come back,” says Alonzo Patterson, a full stack developer who recalled a bitter experience at a hackathon at Facebook’s campus in Menlo Park. No one was outwardly racist to him, he adds, but every time he offered to take on a piece of a project, he was rebuffed. “No one thought I was a coder. I had my laptop, but I couldn’t join a team.”That sense of being underestimated and written off is echoed by Kathryn Finney, founder and CEO of digitalunided, who went through a startup accelerator program in New York. “People had no expectations of me,” she says. “Not just low – no.”Finney’s work now includes preparing her cohort of black and Latina startup founders for pitch meetings with venture capitalists, the vast majority of whom have never invested in a company founded by a person of color, let alone a woman of color. In their 60-second pitches, the founders all included market research, a business plan, and revenues to date, even if those earnings are currently measured in the hundreds of dollars.It’s a sharp contrast to one of Atlanta’s most well-known tech startups, YikYak, which was founded in 2013 by two white college graduates and showered with more than $70m in venture funding. The anonymous message board app enjoyed viral success on high school and college campuses, became notorious for cyber-bullying and racist abuse, and eventually shut down in 2017 without ever having generated a dime in revenue.For startup founders at The Gathering Spot or digitalunided, that “business model” simply isn’t an option. Not only will no one write them those checks, but they usually come from families without the generational wealth to support them through revenue-free explorations.“If it doesn’t make money in the first three months, we gotta go,” says Reid.Finney pointed out that many of the female founders in her incubator are holding down full-time jobs while they try to get their companies going. “It’s easy for Silicon Valley to say you should be full time,” she says. “If you are a successful black woman, you are usually supporting other people. We can’t just erase our family.”But alongside the challenges are opportunities. When Reid first founded Nuracode, he was chasing contracts with some of Atlanta’s big corporations, like Coca-Cola and Delta. But he saw an opportunity when JT the Bigga Figga, a rapper and filmmaker, showed up in his office with $10,000 in cash, asking Reid to build an app because his movies kept getting bootlegged.“We were uniquely positioned for that kind of client,” Reid says. “Where else was he going to go?” Nuracode built the app, which debuted as TrapFlix at SXSW in 2015 with backing from Snoop Dogg. And Reid began focusing on helping local black entrepreneurs – hair stylists, restaurateurs, motivational speakers, and more – go digital.

A school uniform-clad Spears daydreamed in class about expressing her love for a boy through the medium of dance.Looking back on it now, from the 2018 endtimes, that mobile-free, pre-911 world looks strangely innocent, bathed in the artless glow of pubescent pheromones, neon-bright sportswear and dance montages in High School Musical-style sports halls. The video and song were a world away from school mass shootings, rapist frat boys and youth activism. The platform-heeled shoes and knotted school shirt make it the 1990s fashion sister of Clueless, Never Been Kissed and Ten Things I Hate About You, and the bubbly, optimistic friend of The Craft.From that spectacular start, Britney became the US pop princess. And what must a princess be? Well, white and Aryan preferably, but also ever-smiling, pure, gracious, grateful and – above all – well behaved. Dating her childhood friend and career contemporary, Justin Timberlake, in a sumptuous duophony of frosted highlights and double stonewash denim, Spears was the good girl in a trashy world. Remember Paris Hilton’s Barbie Girl schtick? Remember celebrity magazines so shiny they used to slip and wilt on the news stands? Remember when Victoria Beckham liked a silicone boob and a crystal trim on her strapless party frock? Those were the Spears years.Of course, the reality had always been much darker: Spears was not a teen discovery but a factory-grade product who underwent a long entertainment-biz hazing period as a Mickey Mouse Club presenter on TV, alongside Timberlake, Christina Aguilera and Ryan Gosling. These kids were not innocent they had been through the mill and were probably jaded by the time they were 20. I’d be interested to know what was really going on behind those glossy white, bright-eyed smiles.While Timberlake controlled his career with the steely-eyed calm of a Terminator, turning himself (by now) into a top actormusicianfamily mancapitalist, Spears’s public image was more troubled and troubling. She was represented as a Marilyn Monroe figure: unstable, reactive, weak, mere steps away from a meltdown, a dumpster fire or a ransacked trailer. This is wholly unjust: her well-documented “breakdown”, in which she impulsively shaved her head and confronted paparazzi, is a completely understandable and logical reaction to years of being stalked, hounded, goaded, baited and violated by creeps with cameras. Britney was only “mad” in the sense of being incredibly angry. She demonstrated the effects of decades of abuse and was further abused for it. Her video for the beautiful song Everytime, in which she portrays a suicide attempt, was dismissed by fans and critics alike.But she came through it. Global success, sustained across decades, takes incredible effort and is extremely isolating. I remember watching a tour documentary about her, around the time of Me Against the Music, her Madonna collaboration song, in which she said that despite continually writing about and performing her sexuality on stage: “I haven’t even had a kiss in like two years.” I absolutely believe her. Her life looked empty, exhausting and repetitive.Spears has suffered as an artist despite having many singles to her name. She has never quite owned her own narrative or defined her artistic identity or personal viewpoint. Indeed, in Me Against the Music, Madonna sings to her: “Hey Britney, you say you wanna lose control … sexy lady, I’d rather see you bare your soul.” She is a great singer and dancer, and clearly a trouper in terms of work ethic. But even on her most fantastic dance-boosted electro-pop singles, like Toxic, Womanizer, I’m A Slave 4U, Do Somethin’, If You Seek Amy, Gimme More, Boys and Work Bitch, she has seemed like the hired collaborator of the people behind the scenes – usually prolific, hit-making men – rather than the main artist calling the shots.I am interested to see what happens next. Spears is young, strong, rich and experienced, and there’s still plenty to play for. Despite mockery, harassment and fluctuating critical fortunes, she has survived and maintained a family life. She also has a fantastic Instagram feed and an amazing workout regime. In February she will take up a residency in Las Vegas, which she’s calling Domination. Previously a resting spot where once-major stars’ careers went to receive palliative care, following residencies by Celine Dion and Jennifer Lopez, Vegas has become a glittery crucible in which established artists are rejuvenated and bank a wackload of cash.Spears has lived through many dramatic shifts in the wider world, and in entertainment, over the past 20 years. The new pop world is one of short careers, video and music made expensively but streamed for free, fleeting success and a dizzyingly fast turnover of hits. A 90s pop star’s heritage and personal journey don’t count for much with phone-addicted millennials. This is also a time when women artists in particular are expected to have substance, to take a stand, to nail their colours to the mast whether they are talking about #MeToo or Trump, their personal relationships or Black Lives Matter. They can’t just perform the songs and dances of others, as Britney seems to have done, even if she didn’t. It would be great if, after Vegas, Spears went back to the studio, got up to speed, found her true voice, took command and hit us one more time.• Bidisha is a journalist and author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20d33a55e583746d26d06607b490d1fbdee170cd/191_70_2648_1588/master/2648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f78ec833c4e99df60c65e168901f31a1","title":"light verse poetic poem children poetry readers","story":"A new poem commissioned by the Children’s Society will win the hearts of a new generation of readersIn a recent column for the , the Booker-shortlisted writer Robin Robertson declared himself “vaguely appalled” by the poetry world, of which (though a newcomer to the novel) he has long been a feted member. It was, he wrote, small and polarised, and often either simplistic or incomprehensible. “I’m allergic to light verse because it seems a betrayal of the purpose of poetry. Equally, poetry that sets out to be deliberately opaque is betraying the purpose of language.”One can only assume that a poem launched today by the Children’s Society will bring him out in hives, with its sentimental five-stanza invocation of starlight and candles, and its insistence that “No child should reach out their hand and find nothing No child should ever be left in the snow”. Light a Candle was commissioned from the poet Clare Shaw, and will be sung by choirs across the UK, in a setting by the Royal Academy of Music PhD student Louise Drewett, with an outing on BBC One’s Songs of Praise in early December. Shaw, the Yorkshire-based author of three collections, whose work has been hailed as “startling, searing, scorching”, says this secular, 21st-century descendant of Christina Rossetti’s In the Bleak Midwinter is one of the most taxing things she has ever tried to write.Purists will doubtless argue that Light a Candle isn’t a poem, it’s a song lyric. Even Bob Dylan himself seemed a bit taken aback on learning that he had won the Nobel prize in literature in 2016, opening his will-he, won’t-he acceptance speech with the rather touching admission that, on first hearing the news, “I got to wondering exactly how my songs related to literature.” But times they are a-changing: few such misgivings greeted the recent announcement that Kate Bush is shortly to join Dylan on the library shelves when 40 years of her lyrics are published by TS Eliot’s old firm, Faber.Eliot was once a leader of the grumpy old aesthetes’ brigade, arguing that “poets in our civilisation, as it exists at present, must be difficult”, to the dismay of that young whipper-snapper Philip Larkin, who believed in a poetry for the masses. But before anyone thinks that the author of The Waste Land and Four Quartets would be tossing and turning in his grave, remember this: it is his own Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats that – through the nifty reverse manoeuvre of the musical Cats – has helped to keep Faber afloat as an independent publishing house.What does any of this have to do with the face-off between “light verse” and poetry that “sets out to be deliberately opaque”? One answer might be that it’s a false opposition. There is good and bad in both quarters, and one reader’s opaque is another’s moonlit field. Another response is that what passes for light verse covers a multitude of possibilities, including a poetry that is capable of building empathy and community in our snarling, fragmented times. “Having come through abuse and familial estrangement myself, I know that music and poetry can be a transformative experience for young people,” says Shaw.Words that touch the hearts of those young people are important not only for them but for poetry itself, bringing in a new generation and buying time for them to orientate themselves and create their own spaces, which they can then fill in regenerative ways. There was an audible buzz when this year’s Forward poetry prize – which Robertson himself has won – was scooped by the black, queer American Danez Smith, whose propulsive debut collection made a thrilling case for the seriousness of popular forms. In the words of one commentator, this was “poetry as fierce fire”.I’d go further and say that, because of its elasticity, poetry is stealing a march on the novel for inclusion and innovation, and that its vigour is backwashing into fiction. Max Porter’s brilliant Grief is the Thing with Feathers is one example: a hybrid work that co-opts Ted Hughes’s Crow motif for a heart-wrenching exploration of family bereavement.And, significantly, the verse novel is having a bit of a moment. Sarah Crossan, the new Irish children’s laureate, has put it to powerful use, most recently in an exploration of the death penalty. (“This book really made me see things in a different way,” wrote a young reader of a previous Crossan novel, One, about conjoined twins.) Then there is Robertson’s own small masterpiece, The Long Take, which was a frontrunner for this year’s Booker prize, with its filmic evocation of postwar America as seen through the eyes of a demobbed soldier. So despair not – for, as Clare Shaw puts it in Light a Candle: “Beyond the horizon, a new sun is rising.”• Claire Armitstead is associate editor, culture for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fba2ff4e325fd70c0af13ff631594c065666a92/78_296_5833_3500/master/5833.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebaf5a7e76e92fd4622bc0c4b2b54c87","title":"new houses housing targets residents car","story":"Housing targets have led to too many developments where residents are completely cut off if they don’t own a carWhy is it still too much to ask to move into a new house in Britain, and not have to buy a car to go with it? Never mind personal jet packs, I was hoping that by now – a fifth of the way into the 21st century – we might have found a way to simultaneously organise the building of homes, and the means to get to and from them.Not so. A report by the campaign group Transport for New Homes reveals a landscape pockmarked with new developments cut off from public transport, forcing people on low and middle incomes into car ownership – often two per household – for the sake of a cheaper house. Researchers visited 20 new housing developments around the country, many of which, in the report’s words, didn’t “connect to anything other than the road network”.Central government assigns housebuilding targets to councils, which they must deliver purely on the basis of numbers. Local planners ask meekly for funding to integrate new developments into public transport networks and are told to get lost, because properly planned and integrated transport takes time, money and, above all, political will.The net result is that “we are building car parks as much as new homes”, according to the report. Compare this with the Netherlands, where any new development has to have integration into walking, cycling and public transport as a primary priority, and where a nationwide smartcard can be used anywhere in the country on any mode of public transport. (This fact alone makes me want to move there.)Britain right after the war was better served by public transport than it is now. Until the late 1950s most towns and cities had extensive and cheap tram and trolleybus networks to complement buses. Rural and semi-rural areas were served by an extensive branch railway network until the 1963 Beeching report cut thousands of miles from the national network and closed more than 2,000 stations. Only in the late 1970s did some councils, facing increasing congestion and pollution, try to redress the imbalance by offering super-cheap bus fares on their municipal services.While car ownership appears to have peaked, the number of car journeys has risen since the 2008 crash, suggesting more pressured lives, longer and more frequent commutes, and the legacy of public transport cuts. Younger people are increasingly drawn to cities, where public transport tends to be better, and are less likely than ever to own cars. Yet those who live outside cities are increasingly forced towards car use, purely because planners can’t force developers to do anything other than build houses.For a few years at the end of the last Labour government, I was on the judging panel for the Building For Life awards, set up by the now-defunct Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe) to draw positive attention to examples of good housebuilding and planning practice across England and Wales. The bar was set miserably low, but only by necessity.When presented with yet another mean and featureless set of Noddy dwellings in the middle of nowhere, the panel’s chair, the designer and architect Wayne Hemingway, would chuck the brochure on the floor until we were left with a handful of reasonable entries. A collective cheer would go up every time we saw evidence of a bus stop and a playground that didn’t consist of three springy chickens.Ten years ago, there was still a sliver of hope that awards such as these could drive the quality of new developments up to a level approximating those in Sweden and the Netherlands. Then Labour lost power and the incoming coalition government set about destroying anything that spoke of guiding or regulating the market to do anything other than provide dwellings – any dwellings – that could be counted towards its arbitrary housebuilding target.The Tories decided Cabe was a waste of money. Yet, as the Transport for New Homes report states, local authority planners are relentlessly batted away by developers on spurious grounds of cost and the perceived difficulty of joining up housing development with integrated transport. Developers can get away with what they like as long as they stick something that looks like a house on to the land they have access to.Developments like these may as well be on the moon, for all they enable people to live the healthier lives they are told they should be living, to make the car-free journeys they are told they should be making, to be the citizens of “somewhere” rather than “nowhere” that they are exhorted to be. Car parks don’t make communities.• Lynsey Hanley is a freelance writer and the author of Estates: an Intimate History (Granta)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d427bdeb22d48d17492ffeeab93074211cbb4bd2/0_239_5132_3080/master/5132.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f072ca4ccfef54f8f4933f4252df39","title":"we new era slum landlords tenant squalor","story":"The government must build more housing, expose exploitative landlords and give local authorities power to punish themIn the 1950s and 60s, Peter Rachman gained infamy for his exploitation and bullying of tenants. Mostly targeting new immigrant communities from the Caribbean, he gamed rental laws and sub-ided hundreds of flats in west London, extracting maximum profit from minimum service.Rachman would have felt at home in Theresa May’s Britain.Damp bedrooms, faulty heating systems, electrical faults, broken plumbing, unsanitary toilets, and rat-infested kitchens are depressingly familiar in our swollen private rental sector. In my constituency surgery recently, I met a family of nine who had been crammed into a single two-bedroom flat for 13 years. Another constituent, a women in her 20s with a young baby, has spent months choking on the damp and mould the council described as a “health hazard”, which her reprobate landlord refuses to fix.When I grew up in the shadow of the Broadwater Farm estate in the 1980s, life was tough. Nevertheless, my mother, a Windrush migrant and single parent, was able to purchase a home at about three and a half times her salary. What followed was Thatcher’s deliberate creation of a new class of buy-to-let landlords, which enriched a generation at the cost of their children. Today, even middle-class, dual-income couples cannot afford a one-bed flat without a deposit from the bank of Mum and Dad.Pushed into the private rental sector by default, the former manufacturing classes, university graduates and first-generation migrants are forced to fight it out. They scroll through Rightmove and Facebook groups frantically, battling for rental contracts in ever smaller, dirtier, and less central rooms, which cost more and more rent. They take whatever they can get. One in seven now gives more than half of their salaries to landlords.We are living in a new Rachmanite era of squalid housing on steroids. Highly organised gangs of rogue landlords have been allowed exploit the housing benefit system unscrupulously. Wealthy investors from Britain and abroad target desperate local authorities, making millions by consuming the lion’s share of housing benefits in return for tiny rooms with shoddy and dangerous facilities. Even when landlords are found to have committed housing offences, which show them to be unfit, they continue to collect rent.The government’s response to this crisis of living has been pathetic. Thanks to the  and ITV News investigation, the government has made a U-turn to allow the public to see its rogue landlord database. But, when not a single name had been entered into the database six months after its launch, who will this help?To fix this broken system, we need a complete rebalancing of the power relationship between landlords and tenants. The underlying issues of the housing crisis will only be solved by the construction of social and genuinely affordable housing on an unprecedented scale.

I don’t know exactly who is booked for next year’s Wireless festival in London but let’s hope they are jolly and well-brought-up people who will keep the noise down. I mean, that’s what you want at a festival isn’t it?Well, no. And Wireless isn’t for the likes of me, though I can hear it from where I live. Interestingly, the biggest sound I ever heard coming from Finsbury Park was when Madness played. The ground was shaking. The earth moved for the centrist dads that day.Now Haringey council in its infinite wisdom has, after listening to protests, agreed that Wireless can continue, but performers have been told they must not swear, make obscene gestures or wear skimpy clothes on stage. They cannot “make any vulgar gestures actions or remarks during the performance, or at any point whilst using an amplification device, including the use of expletives”. To which the only thing you can say is two words made of asterisks.There are problems with Wireless, and Lily Allen and Annie Mac have pointed them out: the lack of ersity, with only three female acts booked over three days this year. But that is not what this is about. Instead it’s part of the clampdown on what is politely termed “urban” music. Everyone knows what that means, but they can’t bring themselves to say “black”. Under these new rules, the likes of Stormzy and Kanye West would be banned.Locals have legitimate complaints: there aren’t enough toilets there are drug dealers and the ever-present fear of gangs – but Haringey cannot boast of its multiculturalism and then come out with this ridiculous ban. It’s the latest in a long line of attempts by the police to stop certain gatherings, which included the infamous form 696, a risk assessment used to stop bashment etc. In my day the government tried to ban “repetitive beats”, which is as mad as it sounds.I cannot imagine life without swearing, for swearing is life. Lately, football commentators have taken to apologising when microphones pick up the crowd’s chants or managers’ swearing. This is such a weird infantilising of the audience: we can hear swearing but are told we somehow shouldn’t have. It’s the equivalent of bleeping and asterisks, all of which bemuse me. Swearing can be dull and lazy and simply an exclamation mark, or it can be fantastically creative and funny. It is malleable, like all language, and when it is done in Portuguese by José Mourinho, who among us is truly offended? Indeed, it should be subtitled.Once I worked at a paper where the fashion editor was called in and given a bollocking (is that swearing?) for describing a frock as shit brown. I got it, though – for if there is anything a fashion writer should be able to do, it is surely to come up with 50 shades of brown. There is a directness, a vivacity about swearing that I love. It is the complete opposite of the insane legalese of this ruling from Haringey. What does the wearing of few clothes have to do with anything? Fuck knows.Gatherings of young people listening to loud music are always going to frighten the horses, I suppose. That is the entire point. The solicitor representing the Friends of Finsbury Park – the right kind of urban crew, we must presume – said its residents had “witnessed their sash windows vibrating” .Now, if that’s not a euphemism, I don’t what is.Something should be banned here, I’m sure. But it’s not swearing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c49301dff8ecc0534a906353125c5c8880c647f/0_154_4369_2622/master/4369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dbb1b451b6d296373c98e2e521d5e32","title":"worst aspect us attempted pipe bombings inevitability","story":"President Trump’s reckless rhetoric towards opponents has helped stoke this hideously violent time in politicsThis week, pipe bombs were sent to prominent Democrats including George Soros, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. CNN also received one in the mail. Sadly, none of this was really that shocking. The news had an air of inevitability, being the culmination of what has been a hideously violent time in our political culture. Poison is coursing through the US body politic. Violence permeates political dialogue and sometimes erupts at political events.The shocking thing is that some of the violence has been endorsed by the president himself.At a rally last week in Missoula, Montana, President Trump celebrated the Republican representative Greg Gianforte, who violently attacked the  reporter Ben Jacobs last year. Jacobs, who was simply trying to ask a question about healthcare, was body-slammed and hurt by Gianforte, who won election to the House but later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault. At the rally last Thursday, Trump cheered the congressman as a “tough cookie”, and roused his supporters by loudly proclaiming: “Any guy that can do a body slam, he’s my kind of guy.”Trump has repeatedly invited his supporters to beat up protesters at his rallies, implying that the protesters bring this on themselves by disrupting him.Neither the fatal shootings at a newspaper in Maryland nor the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul have discouraged the president from blasting journalists as “enemies of the people”. At a CNN forum on Monday, Maggie Haberman of the New York Times talked about her children sobbing because they are so scared for her and their own safety because of the vitriol and threats that are flung at reporters covering Trump rallies. Arthur Gregg Sulzberger, the Times’s publisher, took on the admirable task of warning Trump during a White House meeting that his verbal savaging of journalists would, inevitably, lead to something terrible happening. But the president has not heeded him.After tragedies, Trump talks from both sides of his mouth. Belatedly, he condemned the death of Khashoggi but then praised Saudi Arabia, which is widely believed to have planned and executed his killing, as “a great ally”. After the death of a protester in Charlottesville, where violent, torch-carrying mobs went on a wilding to defend Confederate statues, the president notoriously said “both sides” deserved blame for the violence, an outrageous statement he has repeated since.On Tuesday, Slate published an incisive piece condemning the president after a Monday night rally in Houston where he declared himself a nationalist. The headline on the article said it all: “Trump celebrates violence and nationalism at his rallies. Republicans are not pushing back.”That was the same day the first pipe bomb arrived at the suburban New York address of philanthropist and major Democratic donor George Soros. Then, on Wednesday, came the sickening news that more suspected pipe bombs were sent to Democrats, to the homes of the Clintons and the Obamas. CNN was also a target, with a suspect package addressed to former CIA director, John Brennan, an Obama administration veteran and frequent Trump critic, who happens to appear mainly on MSNBC. Former Democratic party chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz may have been the intended recipient for another bomb addressed to Florida. New York mayor Bill De Blasio has rightly called the pipe bombs an “act of terror”.With FBI investigations just starting, it’s impossible to say whether the perpetrator or perpetrators were rightwing nationalists, but their intended victims suggest the possibility of such markings.Sarah Sanders did issue a proper White House statement condemning the attempted bombings. “We condemn the attempted violent attacks recently made against President Obama, President Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and other public figures. These terrorizing acts are despicable, and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. The United States Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and will take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards.” Obviously, the president’s aides want to avoid reflexive connections being made between the president’s increasingly irresponsible and violent rhetoric and the pipe bombs.And yet, on the same day that CNN was the recipient of a bomb, the president took another shot at the press. At a Wisconsin rally, he said: “The media also has a responsibly to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories.”The horrifying political violence that has been building for years and has been directed at Republicans, too, including when Republican representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana was shot and gravely wounded at a congressional baseball game in 2017. But in recent weeks, it has erupted with frightening regularity. On 14 October, in New York City, a violent scuffle resulting in arrests broke out after an appearance at a Republican club by Gavin McInnes, the rightwing founder of the Proud Boys, a group of self-described “western chauvinists” that the Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled a hate group.The most eloquent reaction to the pipe bombs came from George Soros’s son, Alexander, who wrote an op-ed titled “The hate that is consuming us”, in the New York Times published on Wednesday. It began: “Bombs sent to my father, George Soros, and to former president Obama and Hillary Clinton are a result of our politics of demonizing opponents.”The younger Soros noted that the vitriol used to be confined to the fringe extremes. “But something changed in 2016.” Since Trump’s election, it’s been spreading like a wild contagion. Rather than stoking the hate, the president needs to recognize the terrible recklessness of his own rhetoric."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3865687fb7c9d7a287e31b20f6d0ce7700ed585f/68_757_1791_1075/master/1791.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc42083fe29eafda7d4f6106c1b41050","title":"take two our pick of the best jumpers and midi skirts in pictures","story":"From leopard print to pleats and sequins, the unifying factor for this season’s skirts is the length.

Funny can mean strange or humorous. It’s charming.”The  is arguing a truth defence on the basis of evidence to be given by Norvill, who played the role of Cordelia in the production.During his earlier cross-examination of Rush, Blackburn asserted that during rehearsals for the production Rush had made “groping” and “hour-glass” gestures towards Norvill, often sticking his tongue out and licking his lips in her direction.Buday denied seeing any inappropriate behaviour from Rush during the production, though did say that Norvill had been “frustrated” with elements of the production and had been “drowning in the role”.“I was playing a big sister and even though one of us poisons the other and one of us brings the French army in, as actresses we cared about each other and looked after each other,” she said.Earlier on Thursday the court heard Neil Armfield, the director of the 2015 King Lear production, deny telling Rush he was being “creepy” during a scene with Norvill.Armfield is considered Australia’s leading theatre director and a longtime friend and associate of Rush’s.He gave evidence that he never told Rush a scene in the play involving Norvill was becoming “creepy and unclear” and that he did not witness the actor being inappropriate with her.The trial has previously heard an allegation that during a scene in which Norvill’s character lay dead on the stage, Rush, playing Lear, had traced his fingers down Norvill’s body and over the side of her right breast.Rush denied the claim during his own cross-examination.Armfield said he had “no memory of that as an action”, and also denied telling Rush to be “more paternal”.“You were concerned at a development in the way Mr Rush made contact with Ms Norvill in that final scene,” Blackburn said during his cross examination of Armfield.“No, not at all,” Armfield responded.Armfield responded again: “I’ve already said I have no memory of such a note.”Simon Phillips, the director of the Melbourne Theatre Company production of Twelfth Night that Rush pulled out of after the  articles, told the court Rush had been “in a state of anxiety and confusion”.Earlier, Armfield said he’d known Rush since 1979, describing him as “an internationally important actor” whose reputation had been “profoundly” impacted by the  articles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dd358b12a7aef2d458a9a4f537223d33e5e10da/0_357_6391_3835/master/6391.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1556e9f2c1f051e43e514b2821ac0053","title":"tim mcinnerny peterloo mike leigh important prince regent blackadder","story":"The actor is best known for his comic roles in Blackadder, but he is most proud of his work for Mike Leigh’s new film, in which he memorably plays a bloated and obscene Prince RegentThe Prince Regent is late. Not because of arrogance, or drunkenness, or because he was in a laudanum stupor, or having a romp with a mistress. But just because he forgot. “Absolutely no excuse, oh dear,” he says, apologetic to the point of mortification. “Look in your diary!” he adds, castigating himself. “I should remember an interview with the  – especially for this film.”The film is Peterloo, Mike Leigh’s historical epic about the massacre that took place at St Peter’s Field, Manchester, in 1819, when yeoman cavalry charged a huge crowd of pro-democracy protesters, an event that, as well as being shocking and significant, was also instrumental in the birth of this newspaper.He is Tim McInnerny and he plays the Prince Regent, the dissolute son of George III who became head of state after his father’s insanity made him unfit. Although, to be honest, it is difficult to marry the two. On screen is an obscene, obese, pampered future George IV who, as well as providing some darkly comic relief, horribly encapsulates everything that is wrong with society in Regency Britain – absolute power, inherited wealth, a metropolitan elite that doesn’t know, or care, that people in other parts of the country are going without a voice or food (you don’t have to search hard to find modern parallels in Peterloo). And here – admittedly in an eccentric private members club in central London – is this modestly dressed, thoughtful man (he does a lot of pausing and erm-ing before speaking) who has dashed guiltily from his Holborn flat, politely asked for a black americano, and then muttered that some humble pie would be good, too.He is pretty unrecognisable, but certainly not bad in the sense he meant. Quite the opposite, in fact, although it might be over-egging it to say that McInnerny steals the show when he isn’t in very much of it. But the last of his three scenes – in which he shares a tiny sofa with Bailey, who feeds him sugared jellies as he is informed of the events in Manchester – is one of the film’s grisly lingering images.He put a lot of research into the part, read a lot of books (“all of which are completely contradictory”), made 50 foolscap (foolscap!) pages of notes and wandered around London marvelling at his character’s imprint on the capital. Then, rehearsing with Leigh for eight hours a day, the pair worked out how the Prince Regent walked and talked, building the character together.McInnerny, 62, borrowed from real people in his own life. “Preferably not famous people, but Mike did allow me a little latitude with that because he said you are playing a prince so it is kind of appropriate that some of them are famous, who might be useful to use as sort of background fodder. I won’t say who those people are.”Oh go on, why not? “Because … they’re not necessarily going to want to be associated with the Prince Regent,” he laughs. “Think of … ha ha ha, I don’t know … tall, overweight, intelligent people of my generation.” Ah-ha, and who you might have worked with early in your career? “Indeed, yes, and we’ll stop right there.” Who could he mean? Rowan Atkinson, Tony Robinson, Hugh Laurie, Miranda Richardson … none of them quite fits. Who could it be, I wonder? Whoever, McInnerny is keen to point out his prince is a mixture of many people, including contradictory versions culled from different biographies, lots of non-famous people, and a bit of himself too.McInnerny was in Blackadder, of course, as Captain Darling in the fourth series, and – more memorably still – as Lord Percy in the first two. Foppish fool, alchemist, discoverer of “green” (a tiny bit like gold, but worthless and a different colour). McInnerny stopped doing Percy because he didn’t think there was anywhere else to go with it, plus he wanted to avoid being typecast as a toff. He hasn’t entirely succeeded a decade on from Blackadder, playing nice Max in Notting Hill cemented his social standing in many minds. “I suppose whatever is most successful becomes what people think of as your trademark,” he says.In truth, he isn’t very posh. Born in Cheadle Hume, in Cheshire, his father was a civil servant attached to the RAF and got moved around sites looking after transport for the Ministry of Defence. A lot of his childhood was spent in Stroud, Gloucestershire, which is where his mother was from. “We were in accommodation that was rented by the civil service, so it was kind of a civil service version of a council house and, you know, six kids, dad went to work on a bike, not posh at all, upwardly mobile lower-middle class.” His mother insisted that they spoke RP and, because the family travelled around so much, McInnerny did not pick up any accent. He has a neutral voice, which is useful as an actor, he says. “I have a very good ear and can pick up anything when I’m allowed to not play solicitors,” he adds, perhaps with just a touch of sadness.There have been many, varied roles in theatre, film and television. He was the voice of Renault for a while, and acted in a pop video for Kate Bush, a hero of his. A couple of years ago, he was in the brilliant Channel 4 Operation Yewtree-inspired drama National Treasure (“pleasingly difficult, and you thought this is why I became an actor”). And he was Robett Glover in the past two seasons of Game of Thrones, which allowed him to be bitter and bearded (although still a noble). It all tends to come back to Percy. At one charity do McInnerny was at, a woman turned up with her own “green” (actually, her child’s plasticine) that she wanted to be photographed with Percy.McInnerny knew Leigh socially but had never been directed by him before, and he says that working with him was an eye-opener in terms of the level of investment required. “When you meet him for a role, what goes through your head is, ‘This is not going to be like any other way of working you’ve ever done before,’ not to the same extent anyway. So I thought: ‘If I don’t do this, if I find some way of talking myself out of this, then I will never be able to call myself a proper actor, basically.’”Even after he started he had doubts about doing “this proper work”. “Instead of which, he invests you with a great deal of faith. Once you’ve been given the job, it’s like: ‘Well, of course I can do this because otherwise he wouldn’t have chosen you.’ It’s a wonderful thing.”Mostly he is proud of the film because it is a history lesson that is not taught in school. “Why are we talking about all these great kings and queens but we’re not told how these ordinary people having a legal protest, without any weapons, were cut down with swords? It’s kind of extraordinary. I think a lot of people won’t believe it happens in this country.”Even now? “I think it’s saying there are lessons to be learned. I don’t know the kettling of marchers can lead to violence. Things get out of control very quickly if you don’t respond in a human way.” He says actors can be pleased with their work, “but it’s very rare to feel proud of being in something and that it is important. That’s how I feel about Peterloo.”McInnerny describes himself as a “romantic socialist”. The current government isn’t a government: “If the Labour party could get their act together, they could walk all over them.” Corbyn is an honourable man, he says, but not statesmanlike, and there have been too many missed opportunities. Brexit is “embarrassing and shameful”, he says. “As far as I can tell, the economics of it doesn’t work, but also culturally, it’s like we’re happy to be parochial, are we? It’s the opposite of what I try to do in my job.”He wasn’t on the People’s Vote march last weekend, because he was on his way back from filming, otherwise he would have been. He had been in Northern Ireland, not for Game of Thrones but for a murder mystery for Channel 5. He hasn’t been in Game of Thrones since series six. There was no violent death, no explanation, just no call from HBO about which he’s a bit cross. “It’s kind of disrespectful,” he says. “Not just to me, but to the audience. It’s like nobody will notice Lord Glover has fallen off the edge of the world.”It is time for photos, in the alley outside. “I haven’t been able to do my normal cosmetic preparations,” he says, joking I think, before apologising, again, for being late. “Flaky fucking actors,” he mutters.Even that is not the end of it. Later, an email arrives, further apologies from the Prince Regent. OK, you’re forgiven, this time.

The striker had wonderkid status at 15, when a move from Millwall to Liverpool fell apart in heartbreaking fashion, while his abnormal promise would see him become a cult hero in the virtual world. Mention his name to any fan of Championship Manager and they know.Samba was being treated badly by the real world. Aged 19 and after his release by Millwall in the summer of 2004, the Gambia-born Londoner found himself at Cadiz in the Spanish second ision. He had felt dreadfully low at times during his final years at Millwall but the move to Spain quickly turned into a “living hell”.Samba struggled to sleep, lying in bed with tears rolling down his cheeks and, when he did drop off, he would dream about the Liverpool deal and wake with a start. He says that the sport he loves was “burying me alive”, although he did not let on to anyone about the deterioration of his mental health. He bottled everything up and, pretty soon, he could see only one way out.“I didn’t want to be here any more,” Samba says. “My thoughts were: ‘I just can’t take this any more. I want to sleep and forget about everything. And never wake up.’”Samba had started to sneak into the physiotherapist’s room at Cadiz to steal small boxes of painkillers. “I’d grab 10, 12 at a time,” he says. “And when I got home, I’d take some and then some more. I’d get through a whole box of them.”Samba would always wake up in the mornings but, after four weeks or so, he had resolved to take his own life. He skipped training and swallowed “about four boxes” of the tablets. He slumped to the floor, unconscious.Then, fate intervened. Samba had a teammate who would pick him up each morning but the former England youth player did not meet him that day outside the apartment block or answer his phone. The teammate sensed something was wrong. He went upstairs, knocked on Samba’s door and then kicked it down. Samba would be rushed to hospital and saved.“I was one of those people who said: ‘Depression will never happen to me,’” Samba says. “But you don’t know until it grabs you. After I regained consciousness, it really hit home that I was lucky to be alive. It was when I said: ‘This is not me. I have got to sort myself out.’“I felt I’d failed in England and I had to run away to Spain. The Liverpool deal was constantly on my mind. It was a dark time in my life and being alone didn’t help. Everything just escalated.”Samba tells a lovely story from the time when the hype around him was at its peak and it is no exaggeration to say that he was the most wanted schoolboy footballer in England. Manchester United – the club he supported – and Leeds were in for him but Liverpool had rolled out the red carpet when he visited them at Melwood. Samba wanted to join them.“After I’d been to Melwood, I was on the bus with my mates and my phone rang,” Samba says. “It was Michael Owen. I tried to shush my mates, saying: ‘It’s Michael Owen,’ and they were like: ‘Shut up.’ So I put him on loud speaker. The whole bus went quiet. He said it would be great if I came to Liverpool. I couldn’t breathe when I came off the phone and I remember thinking: ‘This is happening.’”Samba had moved to England from the Gambia at six, initially to Watford and then, aged eight, to an estate in Peckham, which had its problems. “If it wasn’t for football, I’d be in prison or dead by now,” he says. “The gang culture was that bad in south-east London.”Samba’s ability with a ball at his feet was freakish and he destroyed all-comers on the estates or for his junior teams. At 13, he scored 132 goals in 30 games for his school while he made his way at youth level with Millwall and England. He was picked as a 14-year-old for England Schoolboys. At one stage, he would keep Wayne Rooney out of the lineup for England Under-17s.Everybody wanted a piece of Samba. One well-known agent, desperate to secure him as a client, offered his stepfather a bribe of £25,000 in cash. It was turned down. The newspaper headlines were sensational, particularly after Samba’s visit to Melwood, when he was photographed in a Liverpool jacket. He was tipped to lead England to glory at the 2006 World Cup. “It was insane,” Samba says. The giddy highs would leave him with further to fall.Why did the move to Liverpool break down? There have been differing accounts over the years. There was the suggestion that Millwall were unhappy when the picture of Samba in the Liverpool jacket came out. Did it drive his price even higher? According to Samba Liverpool were prepared to pay £2m – £1m of it up front – but that Millwall wanted the full amount in one payment. The bottom line was that Samba did not join Liverpool or anyone else. “It crushed my world,” Samba says.For six months, Samba did not play. “I thought: ‘If I can’t have my dream move, I don’t want anything to do with football,’” he says. His representatives fought to secure his release from Millwall and a Football Association tribunal was involved. It was to no avail and, having taken stock, Samba agreed to return to Millwall, with the club having guaranteed him a three-year professional contract when he turned 17.But something had broken. Samba admits he had the wrong attitude. He had always been cocky. Take the time he met Sol Campbell. The England defender signed a ball and gave it to him, so what did Samba do? “I signed it myself and gave it him back,” he says. But now, Samba was verging on the entitled. In his mind, he should have been a Liverpool player.At the same time, Millwall’s stance seems to have been curious. Samba came to feel that some staff at the club had it in for him and wanted to assert their superiority over him to prove a point. “It was a case of: ‘You tried to fuck us, we’ll show you,’” Samba says. He did not develop any further at Millwall and he would not make a first-team appearance for them.Samba’s career drifted from Cadiz to Málaga B to Plymouth and Wrexham to Haka in Finland, Panetolikos in Greece and Tønsberg in Norway. He retired at 29.On Championship Manager, however, Samba saw what might have been. The programmers for the 2001-02 version of the computer simulation assigned him high scores, based on his raw talent, and the gamers knew the drill. Samba was cheap and they would sign him easily. Then, he would blossom.For a long time, Samba was troubled by the discrepancy between his real and virtual selves. Opposition defenders would taunt him about it. He even denied that he played the game, although he did. “I’d be Manchester United, I’d sign myself, I would score loads and we’d win everything,” Samba says. “It sounds a bit weird but the thing is I was great in it!”These days, Samba is grateful to the game’s makers. “I love it, it’s part of me,” he says. “It’s led to so many stories. I’ve got a private plate on my car and the other day, this driver recognised me and got me to pull over for a photo. He then face-timed his mate, who was playing Champ Man and my name was up on the screen. I’ve heard that my US equivalent, Freddy Adu, hates it and feels that the game has messed him up. But it’s just a game. You’ve got to have your own mentality.”Samba is focused on forging a career as a coach. The 33-year-old is close to obtaining his Uefa A licence – he has completed some of his hours at the Tottenham academy – but he has also poured his energy into a soon-to-be-released autobiography. It has been a cathartic process.“I’ve held a lot of anger, anxiety and hurt and the book has allowed me to let go of it,” Samba says. “I only talked about my overdose to friends and family last year. All these years and all these things – people have thought: ‘He’s all right now.’ I wasn’t until the book was finished.”• Cherno Samba: Still In The Game is available for pre-order at chernosamba and AmazonIn the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

The front three of Kylian Mbappé, Neymar and Edinson Cavani are potent enough but the midfield and defence are simply not equipped to win the Champions League. Adrien Rabiot looked like his defensive duties were optional against Napoli while there were loads of space for Dries Mertens and Lorenzo Insigne to exploit behind PSG’s back four. After the game Tuchel was repeatedly asked why PSG are not one of the favourites to win the competition and, having replied to the same question several times, he finally said: “Wow, OK, that is your argument … But our conversation is a bit strange too. We are not at a restaurant. You just asked me a question, I give you my opinion and you have to accept that opinion, no?”Pep Guardiola said the first half against Shakhtar Donetsk was the best Manchester City had played since his arrival in 2016 and they have certainly shrugged off that home defeat to Lyon and should qualify for the last 16 as group winners. Riyad Mahrez has given Guardiola even more options going forward and the return of Kevin De Bruyne means competition for places in midfield is staggeringly high. The Belgian was asked after the 3-0 win in Ukraine whether City could win the competition this season, to which he replied: “We just try to win every game and see where that takes us. There are about 10 teams who could win it.” And out of the 10 teams City look arguably the strongest of the lot at the moment.Luis Suárez had a wry smile on his face that said: “I thought I had scored but fair play to you,” as he contemplated Marcelo Brozovic’s actions to prevent his free-kick from finding the net. The Uruguayan, as is becoming more frequent, decided to aim his free-kick under the wall. So far, so good as the wall jumped and the ball made its way towards the Inter goal. But then Brozovic appeared from nowhere, sliding in on the floor to stop the ball in its track. It was so surprising and so well-executed that even Lionel Messi, in the stands with his injured arm, had to smile. In the end it was not enough for Inter to get a point but they did unsettle Barcelona at times, especially in the second half. The home team showed they can win without Messi and there were signs that Arthur could possibly become a midfield giant for them. Early days, though.Dortmund have been playing well for a long time now – and are top of the Bundesliga – but it was still a surprise to see them beat Atlético Madrid 4-0. It was Diego Simeone’s heaviest defeat in his seven years as Atlético manager and he was full of praise for Lucien Favre’s side, saying: “They played very efficiently, very dynamically. The most important thing is to quickly use possession, and they did so wonderfully, it is very nice to watch.” Favre has so many options going forward and his 4-2-3-1 is working perfectly at the moment. Axel Witsel has been an inspired signing in defensive midfield and it will be interested to see how far this young side can go in the competition.The holders squeezed past Viktoria Plzen 2-1 with goals from Karim Benzema and Marcelo and they are joint top on six points with Roma in their group but there is little to suggest that they will win a fourth consecutive Champions League. Goalscoring, for so long their strength, has become a problem and confidence has been affected. Julen Lopetegui appears to be a dead man walking and the question is whether the players can save him. To be fair to the players, though, it seems as if they do want to save him. After the game on Tuesday, Marcelo said: “The manager is doing a great job. We’re on his side and the results will come. We’ll keep working to win. Real Madrid always come back.”The Dutch side are not quite up there with Dortmund when it comes to attacking fluency and threat but they are becoming a great side to watch under Erik ten Hag, who replaced Marcel Keizer as manager in December 2017. Ajax, just like Dortmund, are full of youthful potential, with the centre-back Matthijs de Ligt (captain at 19), Noussair Mazraoui (20), Frenkie de Jong (21) and Kasper Dolberg (21) playing with a maturity beyond their years. Against Benfica on Tuesday night they simply did not give up and Mazraoui scored the winner in the 92nd minute. They have already drawn away to Bayern and are joint top with the German champions after three games.The gulf in class between Juventus and Manchester United was almost embarrassing for the Premier League team on Tuesday night. The game finished 1-0 to Massimiliano Allegri’s side but they could have scored three or four. The complete control with which Juve dictated the game suggests they will go far this season, too. Allegri has an astonishing capability to tweak his team to make it better and better despite losing key players. They certainly look stronger with Cristiano Ronaldo up front rather than Gonzalo Higuaín and the midfield three at Old Trafford – Miralem Pjanic, Blaise Matuidi and Rodrigo Bentancur – was a lesson in how to control a game. Paulo Dybala got the winner and there are few better forwards in Europe at the moment.It takes time to adapt to the Champions League – everyone knows that – and for Tottenham it is proving a painful experience. Last season they had Juventus on the ropes in the last 16 but despite a 2-2 draw away in the first leg and a 1-0 lead at home until the 64th minute they threw it away. They said they had learned their lesson but this season they have surrendered leads at Internazionale and PSV Eindhoven and Mauricio Pochettino admitted after the 2-2 draw against the Dutch side that Spurs’ hopes of progressing are “nearly over”. This is Tottenham’s third consecutive season in Europe’s premier club competition but it looks as if it is a step back rather than forward for the north London team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e8b98379731124b1892aaa937a9186087faf244/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14a18b8117d117444f2adf70408fc8e3","title":"how well has jose mourinho spent money at manchester united","story":"Mourinho has complained at lagging behind in recruitment, but how much bang have the club got for a spend of £360m?Following Manchester United’s defeat to Juventus in the Champions League, José Mourinho stated his side are below the Italian club and other continental heavyweights such as Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester City, because of a difference in recruitment. The Portuguese, though, has had five windows to build his squad since taking over in the summer of 2016, signed 11 players at a cost of £360m at a net outlay of £285m.Is his complaint that United have not backed him enough valid? Or is the issue too many dud buys from the 55-year-old? Here we go through them one by one …Signed from Villarreal, 8 June 2016Bailly was Mourinho’s best centre-back in his debut season yet has since lost his way. The manager claimed he did not feature at the end of last season as the Ivorian was not “fighting for a World Cup place”. An odd reason. Rating 510Signed from PSG, 1 July 2016The Swede walked his (at times) outlandish talk where it matters: on the pitch, returning 28 goals in 52 appearances though a serious knee injury towards the end of his opening season effectively ended his United career. Just seven more outings followed before departing for LA Galaxy in March. 810Signed from Borussia Dortmund, 6 July 2016The reigning Bundesliga player of the year when joining, Mkhitaryan was pulled off at half-time of his debut in the Manchester derby and subsequently dropped: an augury of what ensued throughout his 18 months at the club before being swapped for Arsenal’s Alexis Sánchez. 510Signed from Juventus, 9 August 2016The Frenchman, bought to be the superstar in Mourinho’s United, is proving a disappointment. At £89m the manager thought he was acquiring a week-in, week-out A-list performer yet instead Pogba turns it on around once every four or five matches, which is not good enough. 510Signed from Benfica, 14 June 2017Like Bailly, the Swede has been in and out of the XI since Mourinho signed him and this caused Ed Woodward to question the manager’s wish to pursue one of Jérôme Boateng, Harry Maguire or Diego Godín last summer. Were they, the executive vice-chairman reasoned, actually any better than the players United had? 510Signed from Everton, 10 July 2017The centre-forward scored 27 in 51 appearances in his debut campaign for United, while also returning 10 in 11 for Belgium in a World Cup year. He may now be feeling the pace and Mourinho admitted concern over his form on Tuesday. 710Signed from Chelsea, 31 July 2017Now Ibrahimovic has left Matic is the sole Mourinho signing who can be rated an unqualified success. The Serb is a classic water-carrier-type midfielder who allows others to perform, and offers consistent 8-out-of-10 displays his manager must wish Pogba or Alexis Sánchez would return. 810Signed from Arsenal, 22 January 2018Mourinho believed a coup was achieved when the Chilean rejected neighbours City for United yet Sánchez has been a near-disaster, failing to contribute a strike-ratio comparable to the 18 league goals Raheem Sterling managed last term. He is also lacking touch, guile and any kind of presence.310Signed from Porto, 6 June 2018The full-back was impressive on debut against Young Boys in United’s opening Champions League match but is again unavailable, having arrived from Porto in recovery from a knee problem. Given Antonio Valencia’s advancing years – he is now 33 – Mourinho will hope Dalot does not prove as injury plagued as Phil Jones. 510Signed from Shakhtar Donetsk, 21 June 2018The midfielder follows Lindelöf last year and Mkhitaryan the previous one: a Mourinho summer signing who the manager seems unsure of. United went behind in the 17th minute against Juventus yet when fresh energy was needed to try and turn the contest, Fred’s 25-year-old legs were not called upon. 510Signed from Stoke City, 3 July 2018The 35-year-old was bought as a No 3 yet had a surprise debut in September’s Carabao Cup tie with Derby County when Sergio Romero was sent off. Was accomplished before the penalty shootout, Grant being unable to prevent the Championship side prevailing 8-7. 510"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cae1fdb22dd03baa4d07e30f25f1990e509166e7/0_228_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1a0d839bf4b92f1f9c1524d058f4e47","title":"liquid gold students make worlds first brick out of human urine","story":"The bio-brick created by students in Cape Town mixes urine with sand and bacteria, which they say is a world firstStudents in South Africa have created the world’s first brick made from human urine.The bio-brick was produced by students from Cape Town, who collected urine from specially designed male urinals at the university’s engineering building and mixed it with sand and bacteria.Bio-bricks are made in moulds at room temperature, removing the need for high temperature kilns. Nitrogen and potassium, which are crucial for commercial fertilisers, are created as by-products during the process.“In this example you take something that is considered a waste and make multiple products from it. You can use the same process for any waste stream. It’s about rethinking things,” said Dr Dyllon Randall, a senior lecturer in water quality engineering at the University of Cape Town, who supervised the project.The idea of using urea to grow bio-bricks has previously been tested in the US using synthetic products, but UCT master’s student Suzanne Lambert is the first to use real human urine to make a brick, according to the university.Bio-bricks are created through a natural process called microbial carbonate precipitation, said Randall, similar to the way seashells are formed. Loose sand, which has been colonised with bacteria that produces urease, is mixed with the urine. Urease breaks down the urea in the urine, producing calcium carbonate, which cements the sand into shape.While regular bricks are kiln-fired at temperatures of 1,400C and produce large amounts of carbon dioxide, the bio-bricks do not require heat.“The longer you allow the little bacteria to make the cement, the stronger the product is going to be. We can optimise that process,” added Randall.The urine is collected from fertiliser-producing urinals, which are also used to make a solid fertiliser. The remaining liquid is used to grow the bio-brick.The vast majority of the phosphorus present in the urine can be converted into calcium phosphate, a crucial ingredient in fertilisers, but one that is depleting in supply.“Given the progress made in the research here at UCT, creating a truly sustainable construction material is now a possibility,” said Vukheta Mukhari, a civil engineering honours student who worked with Lambert."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78246b97099de57467d629fada08157b093f4413/0_72_5742_3446/master/5742.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b829b4fb8dfa1942377f2930a872f23b","title":"hairdressing techno making living worlds largest refugee camp in pictures","story":"In the Bidi Bidi settlement in north-west Uganda, refugees and locals are coming up with new ways to support themselves.

In our earliest months, we respond to facial gestures and tone of voice, smiling our gummy smiles at those who grin at us. As we get older we forge friendships and learn to socialise. A gathering or coming together of family members or pals will, for many, hold happy memories of laughter shared and stories swapped over meals.It can be easy to forget the power of a face-to-face conversation or the comfort of a hug when we increasingly live our lives online. But emojis, gifs and texts can’t replace the feelgood factor of connecting offline and what that can do for our happiness and wellbeing.Packed schedules and the frantic pace of modern life can take their toll. Increasingly, it has become harder to draw the line, with emails pinging in at all times of the day. Mealtimes have suffered – with hastily grabbed lunches wolfed down in front of screens and Netflix dinners taken side by side.But a lunch break should be exactly that – a break – especially since taking time out has been proved to boost focus and concentration. Ditching your desk lunch to eat with workmates is an easy way to feel refreshed, rejuvenated and more productive, as well as being a chance to make meaningful connections and get to know your colleagues better. Similarly, simply switching off the TV, laying the table and asking your family or flatmates about their day over some shared food – and perhaps even a glass of wine – can be transformative, both for your relationships and your wellbeing.Socialising and food go hand in hand for Maider Lizoain, 22, who moved from the Basque country in northern Spain to London to study for her master’s. She speaks fondly of the annual saint feast days held in her hometown. Here, music, massive lunches and merriment abound, as locals gather in the squares to cook together in a joyous, colourful atmosphere. “Family gatherings are a big thing too,” she says. “People have lunch with the whole family every Sunday … My grandpa is from Valencia, so he always cooks paella when we gather.”Bringing the tradition to London, get-togethers with classmates saw Lizoain cook up tortilla: “It’s a typical dish from home and everybody abroad loves it.” As well as being a fun way to connect, dinner parties would give her new friends an opportunity to share a taste of their cultures. “Each person would bring some food or drink. Since we were from different countries, it was a very interesting thing to do,” she explains.Of course, connecting with a new group can be a nerve-racking experience, with a fear of rejection often holding us back when meeting new people. Which is why people find joining groups based on hobbies or interests to be a brilliant way of socialising a common interest can break the ice and sharing a passion makes conversation flow much more easily.For Heather Jones, 31, joining a 20s-30s book club when she first moved to south London worked out not only as a great way to delve into her love of reading, but also as a handy opportunity to make friends locally. Ten years on, she counts many of them as some of her most treasured pals. Their literary meet-ups are still going strong, although they’ve moved away from the library and set up their own book club, favouring gathering at each other’s homes or at a pub instead. “We have a bottle of wine, some food and a catch up,” she says. “We talk about a book that we’ve all read, but really it’s nice to have updates on their lives.”Gathering together around a table to share food and drink has, for centuries, kept people close: from cosy family dinners to clinking glasses of wine at a special occasion. Taking the time to ensure it is a tradition preserved is well worth a moment away from our digital lives.Made for sharingSharing is in the vines at Campo Viejo.

As a family, we’d eat around a little table in a room that I now cannot stand up in, heated by a peat-fired Rayburn and served next door by a composting toilet.My parents were often concerned for my nutrition, and did exceptionally considering their busy working lives. They’d manage to keep the cupboards stocked and cook warming classics from scratch – mince, steak pie, myriad brownish stews. They’d be served with potatoes, often from the garden, and at least one floppy green vegetable.My grandmother lived next door, and as well as secretly plying me with confectionery, from time to time she’d put on a roast. I still have a soft spot for vivid-green broccoli that Gran would boil with bicarbonate of soda until disintegration. Good for soaking up gravy, as well as for dentures.Since leaving the howling winds and isolation of the north for a story of my own, life still revolves around food. It has the amazing capacity to bring people together. Until very recently I was a junior doctor, and I’d unashamedly butter up my hospital colleagues with pastry. The theatre coffee room was always alight with talk of Bake Off and Masterchef, and filled with homemade cakes. It was the pressure from my wife, friends and colleagues who enjoyed my food that forced me into applying to Bake Off. We actually all watched it together, but they felt that it should be me who applied.Since Bake Off, there’s been a significant level of expectation on me when it comes to pudding. I sometimes feel like my wife and I compete in a dinner party league, in which we take turns to host friends in a disingenuous performance of informality.Not that I’d ever reveal the planning that goes into our apparently effortless cooking. But our extensive overthinking hides true incompetence. The construction of a wood-fired pizza oven in the garden over the course of a weekend was one such example. There was the obsession over the type of bricks and granite to use and the clay, which cracked and mildly exploded as soon as I lit the expensive seasoned wood I’d sourced and stacked inside. The result was, at least, only mildly ash-covered pizza.The gathering to eat transcends food, and the drink. I’ll admit that I remember flavours and smells better than I remember sounds or words or even people, but better than all is a feeling of being at ease and in the company of people you like. Following the peak of the pudding, the wine continues to flow. Colleagues and associates leave as new friends and, maybe, with a scrawled recipe or two. Scrunched in a pocket and tossed with receipts, it isn’t the recipe that matters.Makes enough to serve four very hungry Scottish peopleSalted or unsalted butter, for greasingFresh rhubarb, 600g Caster sugar, 150g1 bramley appleDried breadcrumbs, 50gFor the spongeSalted butter, 50gCaster sugar, 50g1 egg, mediumSelf-raising flour, 150g Baking powder, ½ tsp Milk, to loosenTinned custard, to serveI vividly remember standing on a stool to watch as Gran made perfect pastry with her worn hands.Baking was the intergenerational bond that we had between us, and those hours spent in her kitchen dusted in flour are still the memories that define my childhood. This charlotte recipe was one that Gran made to use up any leftovers – and the version I’ve given you here is foolproof baking.Her version wasn’t traditional – we didn’t use sliced bread to line the base and sides. We combined a simple sponge with stewed fruit and it was heaven – especially when warm. This version came about when there was too much pie filling (in retrospect, there’s no such thing as too much pie filling), or we’d overdone it on the sponge mix. It was easy to pick and stew some rhubarb, stick it in a dish and top with the leftover sponge.Gran was a big fan of stewing the rhubarb to oblivion, but this both adds an extra step and loads of washing up. I prefer slicing it thinly, and building it up layer by layer, sprinkling generously with sugar.Start by preheating your oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Use an ovenproof dish that isn’t going to leak. Those trendy blue and white ones are perfect. Give your dish a rub with loads of butter, all the way up the sides.Prepare your rhubarb – get rid of any leaves and the white bits towards the base of the stalk. Slice rather thinly – less than a centimetre, anyway. This helps them break down without stewing, and helps in the layering with the sugar. You can also peel and core your bramley apple, before slicing it thinly, too.\u0026nbspCover your greased dish with a layer of apple, first of all, to help absorb some of the moisture lost by the rhubarb. Sprinkle this with a thin coating of sugar, then layer up with rhubarb. Cover with more sugar, and then continue to layer until you’ve no fruit left. Finally, coat with a thin topping of breadcrumbs: this grabs any remaining moisture to stop the sponge going soggy. Set this fruity construction aside.Now, make the sponge. Into a mixing bowl, place your butter. If it isn’t already really soft, stick it in the microwave until it’s just-about-melted-but-not-quite. If you’re snobbish enough not to own a\u0026nbspmicrowave, stick the bowl of butter over a bowl of hot-not-boiling water.Once the butter is very soft, add in your sugar and give them a quick stir together with a wooden spoon. Don’t bother creaming them. Once combined, add in your egg and give the mix a beat until it’s smooth. Add in your flour (no need to sieve) and baking powder, and give the whole thing a gentle mix until there are no lumps visible. You should have a fairly gorgeous, smooth mix that ribbons as your spoon glides through it – if not, splash in a tablespoon or two of milk to loosen.Scoop the mix on top of your prepared rhubarb and carefully smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Once nearly at the edge all the way around, stick the whole thing in the oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the sponge is a deep golden brown and you can see signs of bubbling rhubarb escaping around the sides. Don’t stick a skewer in, but check the sponge’s doneness by pressing lightly with a finger. It should bounce back at you. If you leave a ot, give it another 5 minutes. It won’t be any worse for it.Best paired with …With its crisp, fresh flavours, white fruit aromas and delicate stream of bubbles, a glass of perfectly chilled Cava Brut Reserva makes an ideal accompaniment to the sharply-sweet flavours of rhubarb charlotte.Made for sharingSharing is in the vines at Campo Viejo.

As the channel finally airs the show in full, the man responsible fesses upThere’s a vast crowd heaving before the Pyramid stage, dusk is turning into night and some shadowy figures have slipped behind their instruments and started to play space-jazz. Here is the culmination of Glastonbury 2000, the millennium festival’s final act, and, for a moment, everything hangs in the balance. Since 1995, David Bowie has released Outside, Earthling and Hours – each sprinkled with the odd cracking song but all grasping rather desperately for the zeitgeist. Bowie’s 53 now, and although he has toured relentlessly throughout the preceding decade, this isn’t his arena or his production. He’s out on a limb and he could fail in front of all these people and the million or more watching on BBC Two …This was the BBC’s fourth year of filming the festival and I was – as I remain – the overall producer of the coverage. The festival was wilder then, before the wall was built in 2002, and we’d survived two of its wettest years in 1997 and 98. We were determined to make Glastonbury’s headline sets required viewing. We’d had Moby on Friday and Travis on Saturday, but the whole narrative of the festival was built around Bowie. However, there was a problem: Bowie really didn’t want to be filmed.The first time I’d met Bowie, he’d been performing on Later … with Jools Holland opposite Oasis in 1995. Oasis were in their messy pomp and although Liam had been on a three-day bender, lost his voice in rehearsal and didn’t appear, Oasis still opened the show. Meanwhile, Bowie was notably skittish when he chatted at the piano with Jools, as if in horror of being pinned down. He was back on Later… in December 1999, opening the show with Ashes to Ashes while promoting Hours, but none of these brief encounters helped when it came to Glastonbury 2000.Weeks of wrangling, cajoling, even pleading through Bowie’s publicist, Alan Edwards, had resulted in an amiable but immovable stalemate. We could film and broadcast the first four songs of the set and then a song or two from the encore, but no more. We spent an hour’s buildup on BBC Two that night with sets from Embrace and Kelis and a short film in which Billy Bragg brought the then editor of the Spectator, Boris Johnson, to Glastonbury. We had Bowie’s astonishing, hit-laden setlist in our hands by this point and the crowd were chanting “Bowie! Bowie!”At just after 10pm, Bowie appeared on a backstage camera, looking nervous but determined. Moments later, he was on stage, sporting a three-quarter-length Alexander McQueen frock coat, wonderfully wide Oxford bags and long hair swept to the side a la Veronica Lake. Where had I seen this outfit before? It struck me there and then, that Bowie was referencing his own performance at this very same spot almost 30 years earlier, and that he looked just as groundbreakingly beautiful and “gay” now as he did back then. For all his reputation as one of rock’s great shape-shifters, Bowie had decided to headline Glastonbury as … himself! He launched into Station to Station’s Wild Is the Wind, then China Girl, and already the nerves were gone and he was visibly beginning to enjoy himself. He followed it with Changes, a song he’d debuted at that 1971 Worthy Farm appearance as the sun was rising. We were only three songs in and the crowd were already eating out of Bowie’s hand.Bowie had not been one for playing greatest-hits sets, but that night it was clear he’d come to reclaim his legend. And as Edwards and I began watching the set in director Janet Fraser-Crook’s scanner, it was obvious we were heading for a broadcasting disaster if we cut it short.I persuaded Edwards to accompany me to the edge of the Pyramid stage, where he would try and get a word to David via Coco Schwab, his legendary assistant. The set was so clearly going to be a resounding triumph, that surely – surely – this had to be shared with the watching nation? We stood there watching Changes and some of the fourth song, Stay, but there was only a shake of the head from Coco and no sidelong glance from the stage, where Bowie and band were riding high. At least these shenanigans bought our broadcast one more song assistant producer Alison Howe was charged with staying with the set until I returned to the BBC Two scanner, and so we shared a fifth song – which just happened to be Life on Mars?I rushed back into the BBC Two scanner moments before the end of Life on Mars? and had to explain to the presenter, Jamie Theakston, that we were coming off Bowie. I should have asked him to explain to the nation that it had been insisted upon by the artist himself. But naively I didn’t want to blame Bowie: it was the early days of our coverage and I hadn’t yet reasoned that the audience’s expectation of a Glastonbury headliner no longer sat with the artist but with the BBC.Unfortunately we had nothing to screen that might remotely explain why we were coming off the great man in full flow. To the viewers, it seemed as though it was the BBC’s editorial decision. Jamie sat there by the campfire and – clearly smart enough not to take the hit – proceeded to read out the entire setlist. Which we wouldn’t be broadcasting … “I am not sure I’m supposed to do this,” he announced, before running through hit after hit while the sound of Absolute Beginners wafted over from the Pyramid stage.Jamie promised to bring “an encore or two” from Bowie’s set later on, but that was nearly 90 minutes away. Basement Jaxx weren’t on yet, neither were Ozomatli. And anyway, how could any other band replace Bowie in his pomp? In the end, Jamie introduced a short film exploring the world of underground theatre at Glastonbury, which culminated in Jools accompanying Michael Eavis on some Elvis gospel from the Rabbit Hole. It was bizarre and inexplicable and, if I had been a viewer, unforgivable.Meanwhile Bowie’s set progressed, constantly scaling new heights. The frock coat came off early but the intensity just kept on growing. At one point he told the crowd: “This is so cool for us, it really is cool – I fucking love it!”As we were providing images for the huge stage screens, we rolled the tapes so that at least the footage of the show would exist. Meanwhile, our broadcast staggered on. We went back to Embrace and played their post-Oasis anthem All You Good Good People. We joined Basement Jaxx on the Other Stage, left when they suffered a power cut and returned to Jamie to explain what had happened. We returned to Basement Jaxx, we joined Ozomatli, we went back to Basement Jaxx. Finally, just after 11.30pm, as per our agreement, we rejoined Bowie for two encores, Ziggy Stardust and “Heroes”. Wonderful, but too little and much too late.I spent the next two weeks writing to viewers who complained about us not showing more – or all – of Bowie’s set. Since then I’ve often tried to persuade his management to let us screen more of that night’s performance. There were mutterings about audio quality, about some aspects of the performance, but I think the great man already had at least half an eye on posterity.Of course, Glastonbury 2000 wasn’t Bowie’s last show, far from it. There were the massive Heathen and A Reality tours and then the heart attack on 24 June 2004 in Germany that effectively drove him from the concert stage. Bowie then all but disappeared for a decade, until those final two albums and the brilliantly orchestrated occasion of his passing in January 2016 when, once again, he took centre stage.These days, headliners have largely come to believe that sharing their whole set live on BBC Two is part of the attraction of playing Glastonbury, that they want to embrace the occasion and play to the world. Some knock it out of the park, some less so. But I think Bowie knew exactly what he was doing on the night of 25 June 2000. He wasn’t about to give away his peak performance or his catalogue for nothing. He hoarded that night so that one day it could be shown in all its glory as his legacy, the culmination of his golden years and surely his greatest concert since he buried Ziggy Stardust at Hammersmith in July 1973. It’s a time capsule of his life, ready to be shared with us now that the stars have aligned.

I\u0027m glad to control the narrative for a second instead of being swallowed up by Tory trolls. Thank you. Goodnight.Does it annoy you that some people come to the shows just to hear Pavement songs? What was behind the decision to play them in the encores of this tour as opposed to playing more Jicks numbers?It does not annoy me. Maybe if people are calling out for them during the whole set, we would ask you to refrain from that so we could focus on the present moment, which is playing our album. But an encore is a time of just to mess around. There\u0027s supposed to be some different field to it, I think, a cover song or something unexpected. So as we started doing them, it\u0027s seemingly unexpected, but of course with the internet everyone knows what\u0027s coming. So really it\u0027s a little golden Easter egg we\u0027re throwing out at the end. And it\u0027s fun to play for the band, I think. At least, they tell me that. They can play anything, the Jicks. Like I\u0027ve said, we might as well play our own songs and get the PRS. Ha ha.Who is your favourite guitar player?I like Bert Jansch a lot, old folkie Scottish guy. Steve Gunn, a young gun. He\u0027s amazing.I first came to Pavement’s music after Blur had cited the band as an influence for their self titled album. Were you aware of the influence?Yeah, cos I know those guys. Around that time they came around some Pavement shows and Graham especially has always been open in digging Pavement. And mutual fanclub, cos I think he\u0027s cool. I think Damon\u0027s awesome at music, golden voice, golden boy, makes it look so easy to be like, in all the genres.Can you enlighten us with the Oasis anecdote…?No, not really. Their first album, we played at that festival in Holland, it could be Pukkelpop, and they were on right before us in a tent, and on they went. And I thought they were playing so slow, and like, bar chord-y and lead, it sounded like, sawed, I had no idea that it was gonna take off like that. I\u0027ve seen them three times since and the concerts were just atrocious. Their albums are good, I like their songs, I think they have beautiful songs. This everyman, Fred Perry, Beatles catchiness, I relate to it. But the shows, I couldn\u0027t believe the mediocrity. Maybe I caught them on an off night. Three times.Have you ever been a teacher or taught music? Once at my kid\u0027s school, there was an auction, and I auctioned my services and the dad showed up. He was like, just beginning. So he had his acoustic guitar and I wanted to give him something that sounded hard to play that wasn\u0027t. That\u0027s usually a good way to inspire somebody to wanna play. Like, it\u0027s not that hard, I can do it. So I taught him the chord to Purple Haze, his first minor seventh. And he couldn\u0027t play it.Nothing behind it, it\u0027s right in front of you. It\u0027s from the era of cryptic Pavement, when that\u0027s the kind of lyrics I wrote. The music itself is straight ahead, I think. It\u0027s got a little bit of emo in it.Stephen, ever consider collaborating with Robert Pollard? What is your relationship with him like?I never have considered to collaborate with him. When has he ever collaborated? Doesn\u0027t need it. He\u0027s awesome at what he does. I don\u0027t think I could add anything. It\u0027s a universe in and of itself. We don\u0027t need another universe where it\u0027s like, me and Bob. He\u0027s great.When you lived in Berlin did you ever visit Berghain?Yeah, been there like four times. To me it\u0027s an institution. It is just a dance club and its great for that but it has an added - where I live in Portland, there\u0027s these places people visit like Voodoo Donuts, and actually the donuts are terrible, but people wait in line and it\u0027s something you do when you visit. It\u0027s something you should do in Berlin. Not every tourist should go to Berghain - you\u0027ll get turned away - but everyone reading this, you\u0027re all going to get in if you\u0027re not off your head. Great soundsystem. Really fun.Mark E Smith accused Pavement of being a “rip off” of his band, one that did not “have an original idea in their heads”.With the resurgence of music inspired by the 90s, and bands in England such as Hooton Tennis Club and Happyness being accused of cribbing from Pavement, how do you feel about bands taking inspiration from Pavement? Is it a pastiche or do you feel proud to have inspired young artists?I wouldn\u0027t be the one to accuse anybody of imitation. Imitation is a pejorative, so it\u0027s like, how do you - inspiration, imitation, we\u0027re all in a hall of our heroes when we\u0027re playing music. Sometimes when I\u0027m playing concerts, I actually embody, symbolically, I\u0027ll pretend I\u0027m Keith Richards for a second when I do a song like that. I\u0027m not me any more. It\u0027s like play acting. And even if I\u0027m not embodying a specific person, just the images I have in my head are taken - they\u0027re not my images. The visions I see, I don\u0027t see myself. We\u0027re all doing that, it\u0027s no big deal. And it\u0027s an honour - the fact, more concretely, if anyone bothers to listen to you, it\u0027s an honour. And they\u0027re not making any money off it so I don\u0027t have to be jealous about that cos no one is.Your lyrics are endlessly fascinating. Is there any chance you might publish a book of them one day?Not lyrics. I mean, the concept of a book is a bullet that you have in your belt if things get really desperate. I know that there is a publishing house that would do that - like a memoir - but like I say, it\u0027s kind of a cyanide pill you have at the end. If you\u0027re a secret agent, you carry it in a little locket. What\u0027s my resistance to it? The work. Self-consciousness and how to develop your voice and not have it just be another one. Fear. Everything like that.The recent experimental music which you put together and is fast becoming lore – will you be putting it out any time soon? Yes. It\u0027s in the pipeline. Don\u0027t get your hopes up for major, major, major experimental, but you know, no guitar solos. It\u0027s different. It\u0027s amazing. Just gotta get that out there.Are there any plans to release the soundtrack to “Flaked”? I don\u0027t think so. There was but I think the show just kinda got lost in the bittorrent universe of too much content and its averageness. It\u0027s just another show to be honest, no disrespect to everybody who all worked on it. But some things people take to and... I did see the show, when I was watching Better Call Saul, there\u0027s a show called Lot 49 or something that comes on right before, and I watched an episode of the show and it\u0027s basically Flaked done again with a slacker dude, Southern California climate. So the idea of Flaked was one that male screenwriters continue to fantasise about.Do you remember your worst case of writer’s block? How the hell did you break through it?I feel kind of like lyrically, it\u0027s always lurking. And as I get older, for better or worse, it continues not only because you\u0027ve painted a lot of the rooms already in a certain way and don\u0027t want to repeat yourself. The world continues, and lots of other avenues and people have taken what you did or bounced off it - they\u0027re not just listening to you - but in the field, lots has happened and it becomes tired, what you did in the past. It loses its glow. And combine that with my mind itself becoming - whatever\u0027s happened, I\u0027m either more picky, or less, it just doesn\u0027t flow out. You have to dig harder. And beyond that, the times themselves - not only just history passing but the actual times of now, what works now is difficult, I think, to find a language that can connect or glows, at least to me. So all that leads to writer\u0027s block. If you think that, like I just said, how are you not gonna be, right?With weed being all legal and stuff now, are you ever tempted to return to blaze up and pump out some downtuned stoner rock?You can even call cocaine a tool to keep you up for a good party night or something, but let\u0027s say marijuana, you listen with a different perspective to your music, I think it\u0027s useful. I think it\u0027s worth exploring to listen, to at least run your tracks through a stoner test. The proof\u0027s in the pudding. I know a lot of hip-hop is created completely baked, and the data is in - people love the stuff."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef3ec17ae812600ed3184618fd83f38e4c7a7a4f/0_0_3500_2250/master/3500.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f1338531fbe1c836eb7ccbf8afbb293 880w","title":"no deal brexit could raise price of mince by 50 meat industry says","story":"Burgers and spag bol could be priced out of many families’ reach, NFU conference hears“It would be a significant price rise and it’s a valued product to the consumer, not just used in spag bol but also lasagne and koftas,” said Katie Doherty, policy director of the International Meat Trade Association.Speaking at a National Farmers’ Union conference in London she said no deal would mean huge food inflation, with World Trade Organisation tariffs highest on food products.This is because Britain eats more than twice as much beef as it produces and is highly reliant on imports.“These aren’t tariffs that you can just absorb into your business, we are a slim margin sector,” she said.Doherty said the association has estimated it would have to double the number of cattle bred in Britain in order to keep all beef home-grown.Politicians who see Brexit as an opportunity for British farming have argued that farmers simply need to “grow more”.But Doherty said this was a flawed argument. “You can’t just turn on the tap and get more cattle, it would take years to get up to the levels that would be needed,” she said.Products it exports to the UK, including speciality cheeses such as Danish blues, would also be hit.Peter Giørtz-Carlsen, head of Europe at Arla Foods, said under a no-deal scenario the consumer would be faced with a choice – stop eating a product altogether “or choose lower quality”.The NFU has expressed deep concern that Britain’s stated intent to lower tariffs on imports to guard against food shortages would have a devastating effect on British farmers who will not be able to compete on price with EU suppliers.Under the UK government’s strategy for a no-deal scenario, EU products would be cheaper than other non-EU imports and could put British food producers out of business, while British exports to the EU would attract a tariff and become more expensive to the European consumer.“It is a unique lose-lose scenario. We lower our tariffs, the EU doesn’t lower theirs,” said Martin Haworth, director of strategy at the NFU.Arla Foods, which works as a co-operative, sells the produce of one in four British farms.“No deal would not be good for anyone, nobody is benefiting, the supply chain would be broken down the middle with tariffs and non-tariff barriers like extra documentation adding further costs,” said Giørtz-Carlsen.Doherty told the conference that exports of the parts of carcasses that British consumers reject, such as bone and offal, are a key part of the farmer’s business model."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1067e4689b929c7ad2e5cb343f879f7a41c7546/0_460_1489_893/master/1489.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8044cd3f5cef430751729f10269375d1","title":"recording of mothers voice more effective than smoke alarm study finds","story":"Sleeping children three times more likely to wake to voice recording than to loud beeping, research findsIt’s every parent’s worst nightmare: there’s a fire in the house, the alarms are beeping, but the children are sleeping on oblivious. Now scientists say they have found a better way to rouse slumbering youngsters.Researchers in the US have discovered that playing a child a recording of their mother’s voice is about three times more likely to wake them than a traditional alarm. What’s more, it does so faster and is linked to a quicker escape.The team say the research supports a smaller study previously conducted by the group, but reveals that using the child’s name does not make a difference to the effectiveness of the voice alarm. Smith said the team now want to explore whether a voice other than the child’s mother can be just as effective, or if the gender of the voice matters.“If we can get something that can be generically developed and just taken straight out of the packet and is effective for children in this age range then that is our goal,” he said.While one alarm featured a high-pitched beep – the sort commonly found in households – the other three featured the voice of the child’s mother calling either the child’s name, giving instructions such as: “Wake up! Leave the room!”, or both.Each child slept in a lab-based room that resembled a real bedroom, and were shown how to escape from the room before they went to bed. The children were also kitted out with electrodes, allowing the team to make sure that the alarm was sounded when the children were at the same sleep stage each time.The children were each asked to sleep at the lab on two occasions, and were woken up twice with alarms each time, meaning each experienced all four alarms – the order of which was chosen randomly.In addition, the children shook off their slumbers faster, with a median value of two seconds for the voice alarm, regardless of which words were used, compared with more than two and a half minutes for the traditional alarm. Similarly, escape times were longer in the cases of the beeping alarms.Rick Hylton of the National Fire Chiefs Council welcomed the study, but said people should not worry about how effective their current alarms are.“We know smoke alarms save lives. They will alert occupants early, if working, fitted and installed in the correct location. This gives adults, parents or s the opportunity to wake children and leave the house,” he said, adding that children should also be shown an escape plan.Prof Niamh Nic Daéid, director of the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science at the University of Dundee, said the research backed up work by her team that found a human voice combined with a low-frequency pulsing tone was far more effective in waking children than a traditional high-pitched alarm.But she noted that the latest study involved children sleeping in a location other than their own bedroom, which might have made them more receptive to an alarm, while more work was needed to explore whether other familiar sounds, such as a dog barking, might also prove effective in rousing children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/943af9ea26e4f7b4c6c109213453eba346301b34/130_0_3340_2004/master/3340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4a0b8dbb404ffa99c2b705185ed838a","title":"astronomy photographer of the year 2018 the winning images","story":"The US photographer Brad Goldpaint has beaten thousands of amateur and professional photographers from around the globe to win the Royal Observatory Greenwich’s title of Insight Investment Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2018.

However, with the goal of creating more exciting racing, the route features fewer hors catégorie climbs – the most difficult of all – but more category-two climbs, which can encourage attacks.The total race distance is 3,460km, with the Grand Départ set for Brussels on 6 July and the finish in Paris on 28 July.“Holding the Grand Départ in Brussels is a wonderful way to honour the man who best represents the image of the yellow jersey, cycling’s greatest ever champion, Eddy Merckx,” Prudhomme said.There are also seven supposedly flat stages that are best suited to the sprinters. “We are virtually guaranteed wind on one of those and confident there will be wind on a second one, too,” said Prudhomme.From there, the riders will head south west across France towards the Pyrenees, where there will be a time trial around Pau, a summit finish on the famed Tourmalet and a stage that goes over the imposing Mur de Péguère before finishing above Foix at Prat d’Albis.The final battles will be fought in the Alps. A brutal stage 18 will take riders over the Col de Vars, the Col d’Izoard and the Galibier within the space of 207km. A day later, the 123km stage 19 includes the Col d’Iseran, before the penultimate stage up to the finish at Val Thorens.Merckx was joined at the ceremony by Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain, the only other men to have won the Tour five times besides the late Jacques Anquetil. It is a club Team Sky’s Froome is one Tour victory short of joining, having been beaten to yellow by his teammate Geraint Thomas this July.Organisers also announced details of La Course, the women’s race which takes place during the Tour. This year’s race will be a one-day event, covering five laps of the time-trial course around Pau for a total distance of 120km. The route includes the Côte d’Esquillot, which could prove the springboard for a race-winning attack."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc79db56f5ca56915d10ef5516a26abc6c578c4b/107_251_2426_1456/master/2426.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bd26985728c67da37728a4745972084","title":"ferrari mercedes sebastian vettel lewis hamilton f1 title race","story":"The speed with which Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes learn from mistakes has been critical in the F1 title raceThe title is long gone for Ferrari and Sebastian Vettel and they know it. Indeed it would be hugely surprising if Lewis Hamilton does not win his fifth championship in Mexico this weekend. Yet for Vettel and the Scuderia presenting a coherent and constructive challenge for the last three races could be cause for optimism in a season when they have let the championship slip away.After showing strong pace at the US Grand Prix, where Kimi Räikkönen won and Vettel believed he had the speed to do the same but for his grid penalty and spin, Ferrari seem to have found their mechanical mojo again.They did so, Vettel admitted, by rolling back most of the upgrades they have brought to the car since Singapore. The German said they had gone down the wrong route, which had cost them, and had compounded that error by being slow to identify why they had lost their pace advantage. At the same time Mercedes extracted more from their car when it mattered.Like last season, then, when Hamilton wrapped up the title in Mexico City, Ferrari have failed to maintain their challenge in the final third. They can address this but, if they are to challenge again next year, they must focus on the bigger picture.Vettel’s misjudgments this season have been well documented and now include that clash with Daniel Ricciardo in Austin. His team have been equally culpable and that is a grievous combination when battling Hamilton and a Mercedes team who are functioning better than ever after six years together.Ross Brawn, the Formula One technical director who previously won five titles with Michael Schumacher at Ferrari, clearly believes there are issues with driver and team.“I certainly don’t want to put Vettel in the dock,” he said after the US Grand Prix. “But these incidents can no longer be seen as coincidence but rather they would seem to indicate that Sebastian is a bit out of sorts at the moment.”Brawn is perhaps being generous, given Vettel’s very costly errors at Hockenheim, Monza and Suzuka. But he also believes the Scuderia are not yet the complete package.“Their most important task is to work out how to help Vettel make the most of his massive talent,” he said. “You don’t become a four-time world champion for no reason and Sebastian has definitely not forgotten how to win. In a sport as complicated as Formula One, you only reach your goals if all the pieces of the jigsaw fall into place. If just one piece is missing everything is compromised.”Interestingly, before the Japanese Grand Prix, where Hamilton’s win and Vettel’s sixth place all but ended the title fight, the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, emphasised exactly the same criteria.“In F1 there is not one single element that makes everything else good or bad,” he said. “You need to have a good group of people with the right mindset that build the quickest race car and engine and have the best driver in the seat. If you can combine these you will win races and championships, if one is missing you are lacking a vital ingredient.”Although they have made miscalculations, the Mercedes team have also displayed the requisite collective ability this season and that has made the difference.Hamilton sometimes attracts criticism for his terse radio messages to the team when things have gone against him. But drive and ambition are fundamental to the will to win and were he not to show frustration his motivation would be in question. Crucially, however, he quickly resets and gets on with the job both during races and immediately afterwards by accepting what has happened and then working with the team to learn from it.At Ferrari there has been more of a suggestion that Vettel is taking a hand in how races are run, with the intimation being a lack of a clear decision-making structure and that perhaps fundamentally he is not happy with how the team do things. He, too, has been critical, as has the team principal, Maurizio Arrivabene, but there is less sense that lessons are being learned after problems. “We speak later,” was Vettel’s blunt comment to the team after qualifying at Monza left him starting behind Räikkönen. Yet at the next round in Singapore, they were once again poor strategically in qualifying and were similarly off the ball in Japan.There is no magic bullet to solve this but as Brawn and Wolff have made clear, what Ferrari need to do now appears to be less about mechanical advances and more ensuring they have every component of the team in place to act as a cohesive, singular structure. Anything less will leave them wanting once again next season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dba6c1d998fa0dc3bd146a4a556118310506165/421_116_3020_1812/master/3020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aff614a27187f993d4d4f87ebab76ac2","title":"carolin wozniacki v elina svitolina wta finals live","story":"Elina Svitolina joined Karolina Pliskova in the last four of the WTA Finals in Singapore, after beating defending champion Caroline Wozniacki 5-7, 7-5, 6-3.Elina Svitolina joined Karolina Pliskova in the last four of the WTA Finals in Singapore, after winning the second set of her contest against defending champion Caroline Wozniacki 5-7, 7-5, 6-3.Wozniacki knew only a straight-sets victory would be enough and won the last three games of the opening set to take it 7-5 and give herself hope. The Dane was a break up in the second as well but Svitolina, who had won both her opening matches, hit back and finally took her fifth set point in the 12th game to win it 7-5, celebrating exuberantly.While she was already through, having won more sets than Wozniacki had available meaning the Dane was unable to finish above her in the group, she still needed to claim the match victory in order to finish in first place.The final set was played in a slightly curious atmosphere, both players knowing their fate, but Svitolina came through to win in style, taking a terrific final game to win the set 7-5.Earlier in the day, Pliskova defeated Petra Kvitova to become the first player to qualify.With two matches played in both groups, all eight players remained in contention for the last four. But Kvitova’s hopes were soon over, with only a straight-sets victory enough to give her a chance, and Pliskova recovered from 3-0 down in the second set to beat her fellow Czech 6-3 6-4.The qualifiers from the second group will be decided on Friday, with all four players - Angelique Kerber, Sloane Stephens, Kiki Bertens and Naomi Osaka - still competing for the two semi-final spots. Here’s the final standings in the...erm...White Group.Svitolina speaks: “Unbelievable. I’m very very happy. Caroline pushes you in every game, and I pushed myself mentally. It’s a big achievement for me - I’ve been working for it for many years. It’s not over yet, so I have to stay really positive.” A perfect record for Svitolina in the tournament so far then: three matches, three wins, and she tops the group, ahead of Karolina Pliskova. She’ll go into the semi-finals at the weekend, where she’ll play whoever finishes second in the other group. Which, at this stage, could be any of the four. Wozniacki, as they say, not going down without a fight. A smash is followed by a delicate drop-volley to put her 30-0 up on the Svitolina serve, then a double-fault gives her three break points. But Svitolina comes back with a brilliant backhand down the line, on the run, Wozniacki goes long and suddenly they’re back to deuce. Wozniacki then nets...match point...saved! Great stuff that, flicking a backhand past Svitolina at the net. But after a bit of back and forth, Svitolina closes out the game, set and match with a wonderful backhand drop volley! Third set: Wozniacki* 7-5, 5-7, 3-5 Svitolina (*denotes server) A fist-pump from Svitolina as Wozniacki goes long and gives the Ukrainian two break points. The first is saved, but she takes the second, and looks entirely delighted about it. She’ll now serve for the match and top spot in the group. Third set: Wozniacki 7-5, 5-7, 3-4 Svitolina* (*denotes server) This might be the point where it gets a little more loose. Svitolina comes in and plays a fine drop shot just over the net, which I think is the first time she’s tried that in this match, then Wozniacki tries something similar with...worse results. Svitolina holds. Third set: Wozniacki* 7-5, 5-7, 3-3 Svitolina (*denotes server) Wozniacki, who looked throughly effed off between this game and the last, holds to 30, and Svitolina howls at the moon after putting a simple forehand into the net. She still cares about the result, it seems. Third set: Wozniacki 7-5, 5-7, 2-3 Svitolina* (*denotes server) This last set is just turning into a slugfest. Another serve hold. Svitolina has called for her coach, for some reason. Maybe she needs the motivation to play on and win it. He comes out but runs out of things to say after a few seconds.Third set: Wozniacki* 7-5, 5-7, 2-2 Svitolina (*denotes server) Wozniacki trying to get herself motivated for this, but it’s a struggle. The mind does wander to what this set would be like if Nick Kyrgios was playing it. Wozniacki holds to love. Third set: Wozniacki 7-5, 5-7, 1-2 Svitolina* (*denotes server) A double fault! The first of the game. Suspect we might see a few more of those as they try to blast through the set. It’s not that they’re no longer trying, it just that subtlety has gone out of the window, and both players are being rather more aggressive. Svitolina does that by approaching the net and slapping a short-arm forehand past a grasping Wozniacki. Third set: Wozniacki* 7-5, 5-7, 1-1 Svitolina (*denotes server) Looks like these two are keen to rattle through this set as quickly as possible, and who can blame them? Wozniacki wins that one to love, and both have one of those looks in their eyes. Third set: Wozniacki 7-5, 5-7, 0-1 Svitolina* (*denotes server) So how will this one pan out from here? Both players can basically relax so will this lead to some fast and loose tennis? Maybe not. Wozniacki wins a brilliant first point, but loses the rest and thus the game. Both players have ducked off court for a breath and a break. Reminder: Svitolina is now through to the semi-finals, having got the set she needed to seal at least a top-two spot in the (unfortunately-named) white group. If she wins the match, she will top the group. Wozniacki is now faced with an essentially pointless set: she is out, and playing just for...I dunno. Pride? Is there any extra prize money she can win?Second set: Wozniacki* 7-5, 5-7 Svitolina (*denotes server) Bang! A blasted forehand down the line gives Svitolina two set points...effectively points to stay in the tournament. Wozniacki saves the first with a gutsy deep forehand that Svitolina can’t get above the net...then the second as a backhand goes just - just, just, just - long. Then another, as a Wozniacki shot flicks off the net cord and sits up nicely for her to nail a cross-court forehand...but a big second serve from Wozniacki forces Svitolina to put the ball into the net. Then another of those brilliantly constructed points from Wozniacki, first sending one deep, followed by an audacious drop-volley that has her opponent sprawling like a first-time ice skater. But wait! How topsy and turvey! Two errors from Wozniacki give Svitolina one more chance to clinch it...but AGAIN Wozniacki - under enormous pressure - puts a forehand right into the corner - right into the corner - beyond Svitolina. But she responds with a brilliant cross-court forehand - what a game this is - and this time takes it as Wozniacki goes long! Svitolina is through! Second set: Wozniacki 7-5, 5-6 Svitolina* (*denotes server) But let’s not rule out Svitolina just yet! The second set erts from the first in that it’s Svitolina who wins the 11th game, holding just as clinically as her opponent did last time. Wozniacki must serve for her place in the tournament once more. Second set: Wozniacki* 7-5, 5-5 Svitolina (*denotes server) And just as in the first set, Wozniacki snuffs out the immediate danger like one of those macho lads snuffing out a flame with their bare thumb and forefinger. She holds to 15, barely a whiff of fuss. The two sets have more or less entirely mirrored each other here. Second set: Wozniacki 7-5, 4-5 Svitolina* (*denotes server) That said, Svitolina holds with such ease that you wonder how she was ever in trouble in this match. Just as in the first set, Woziacki is now serving to stay in the tournament. Second set: Wozniacki* 7-5, 4-4 Svitolina (*denotes server) Wozniacki just seems to be able to pull out one of those controlled points whenever she needs at the moment. Of course it helps when your opponent batters a simple enough volley into the net, which Svitolina does to end the game. This is intangible to a degree, but it seems like Wozniacki is just a bit more capable of finding something in the big points.Second set: Wozniacki 7-5, 3-4 Svitolina* (*denotes server) Clinical stuff from Svitolina: this is a match with fluctuations, but at the moment it is fluctuating in Svitolina’s favour, closing out a game smoothly. It’s an extremely even match, this: first serve percentage is basically level, as is points won on first serve, although Wozniacki is way ahead on second serve points won. Second set: Wozniacki* 7-5, 3-3 Svitolina (*denotes server) Every now and then Wozniacki looks like she has Svitolina on a bit of string, sending her exactly where she wants on the court, as displayed by sending her deep to the forehand side before putting simple backhand volley into the vacant space. Then Wozniacki wins with a glorious, unconventional shot to end a brilliant rally: bit difficult to describe really: it was a backhand, she was down low, a sort of half-scoop, half-slice that skimmed over the net and left Svitolina with no chance. Second set: Wozniacki 7-5, 2-3 Svitolina* (*denotes server) Absolutely delicious drop-volley at the net from Wozniacki, delicately taking a backhand just over the net. But Svitolina comes back to win the game, closing it out with a terrific deep backhand, which Woziacki can only send long. Advantage Svitolina. For now. Second set: Wozniacki* 7-5, 2-2 Svitolina (*denotes server) Wozniacki gets a warning for being too slow after the serve clock ticks over, but it seemed someone was taking a picturemoving in the crowd. Seems a little harsh. Wozniacki zips through the first couple of points but Svitolina not only drags it back, but rapidly takes it to break point...which she wins! Wozniacki puts a forehand into the net, and just when it looked like she might have this match by the scruff, they’re immediately back level. Second set: Wozniacki 7-5, 2-1 Svitolina* (*denotes server) Wozniacki has Svitolina on the ropes with a ruthless smash, but lets her off the hook a little by putting a forehand long. But then a volley goes long and the Dane has a pair of break points: and she takes the first! A little half-volley goes past Svitolina after an exchange at the net, and Wozniacki breaks in the third game, exactly as she did in the first set. Second set: Wozniacki* 7-5, 1-1 Svitolina (*denotes server) A backhand loops slowly, slowly, slowly down the line from Svitolina...but loops long. Wozniacki holds when Svitolina goes long with a backhanded second serve return. Two fairly uneventful games to kick off this second set. Second set: Wozniacki 7-5, 0-1 Svitolina* (*denotes server) There’s one of those weird pause-silences as Wozniacki half-thinks an ace from Svitolina has gone out, waiting for it to be called, and the crowd follow suit. But it isn’t, and the Ukrainian takes a relatively straightforward hold to take the first game of the second set. Just another reminder: this set is essentially winner-takes-all. If Wozniacki wins, obviously she wins the match and goes through, but if Svitolina wins she goes through to the semi-finals on sets won in the round robin group. A long rally ends when Wozniacki puts a forehand out, just leaning back enough that you knew it was long as it left the racket. Svitolina tries to challenge a forehand called long on the baseline, but is solemnly informed she has burned through her challenges. A forehand loops long and Wozniacki has two set points: which she snaps up with a terrific ace! The match is alive! First set: Wozniacki 6-5 Svitolina* (*denotes server) Svitolina howls in frustration after putting a backhand wide, but that one was after a strong volley from Wozniacki, rather than a heinous mistake of her own. But ultimately it’s with good reason: Wozniacki breaks, having been in control of most of the game with some of those terrific backhands, and will now serve for the set! Meanwhile, anyone else singing Svitolina’s name to this early-90s hip-hop classic by Del tha Funky Homosapien?First set: Wozniacki* 5-5 Svitolina (*denotes server) Wozniacki serving to stay in the tournament, but confusingly not the match. And she does, with the help of some terrific serves and some careless shots from Svitolina, a backhand down the line that goes well wide, particularly irksome.First set: Wozniacki 4-5 Svitolina* (*denotes server) Always easy to read too much into these things, but could Wozniacki’s complaints have first Svitolina up? She certainly seems to have some renewed purpose, although that hold is sealed when Wozniacki is flummoxed by a slow second serve and puts it into the net. Remember: if Svitolina wins this set, the remaining two of the game are essentially pointless, as that would put her through along with Karolina Pliskova. First set: Wozniacki* 4-4 Svitolina (*denotes server) Always an interesting feature of these tournaments where on-court coaching is allowed: the cameras get right up in the player and coach’s respective grills, so we can hear what they’re saying. Alas, Wozniacki’s conversation with pa Piotr is in Polish, so I cannot enlighten you. Easier to understand is Wozniacki’s complaint to the umpire: she seems unhappy with Svitolina’s grunting, which she claims is happening after she hits the ball. Perhaps that gets into her head, as Svitolina breaks back! She seals it with a nicely constructed point - during which she pointedly didn’t grunt - bringing Wozniacki to the net before clipping a volley down the line for a winner. First set: Wozniacki 4-3 Svitolina* (*denotes server) Svitolina is struggling for consistency it seems: another brilliant backhand winner down the line is followed by putting a relatively regulation forehand into the net. Lovely drop volley from Wozniacki brings them level at 30-30, but Svitolina takes the hold after a point in which two of Wozniacki’s shot loop up off the net cord, both as it turns out to Svitolina’s advantage. First set: Wozniacki* 4-2 Svitolina (*denotes server) Woof! Wozniacki doesn’t smell a fierce return down the line from Svitolina, but ultimately it doesn’t do much good. At the moment Wozniacki seems to be more in control of the points, pulling her opponent this way and that across the court, making her do the majority of the running. First set: Wozniacki 3-2 Svitolina* (*denotes server) Another tracer bullet - backhand, cross-court, not too far from her opponent but leaving her with no prayer nonetheless - from Wozniacki puts Svitolina in trouble again. But from 15-30 she does well to come back and salvage the hold. First set: Wozniacki* 3-1 Svitolina (*denotes server) Wozniacki looks very ready for this. She hits a winner down the line which might as well have flames on it. Then she wins a sensational point at 30-30, drop-shots and volleys and criss-crossing runs over the court ending with a backhand low volley. First set: Wozniacki 2-1 Svitolina* (*denotes server) Svitolina challenges a wide call on a shot that was a good six inches out: not the best use of Hawkeye, or whatever they’re calling the review system. But that’s just one of many errors she makes in that game, the final one being one what looks like a mistimed jump for an attempted smash at the net, the ball it flies off the frame and waaaaaaay out. Wozniacki breaks early. First set: Wozniacki* 1-1 Svitolina (*denotes server) Brilliant point at 30-15 as they trade backhands, then forehands, then backhands again, before Svitolina reaches for a crosscourt and puts it into the tramlines. Wozniacki holds with a fine half-volley from a strong backhand return, aimed right at her toes. First set: Wozniacki 0-1 Svitolina* (*denotes server) Wozniacki needs a fast start - remember, she has to win in straight sets - and she gets it, going 40-0 up on Svitolina’s serve. The Ukrainian saves the first two break points with a couple of good, deep forehands, then Wozniacki puts the third into the net. And then Svitolina emphasises that she’s settled into the match by closing out the opening game with an ace. Wozniacki doesn’t seem too perturbed about her equipment after the knock-up. A mystery. Meanwhile, some stragglers take some time in getting to their seats, but now they’ve made themselves comfortable, they can play. Interesting: bit of an animated conversation between Wozniacki and her father (sitting in the stands), which looks like it’s about her racket. String tension? Not enough spares? Accidentally packed a wooden one that Margaret Court used to use?“I have to be patient - but aggressively patient,” says Wozniacki. I think that just about makes sense. Accompanied by music louder than her yellow trainers, Svitolina is introduced to the crowd. And here comes Wozniacki, a plaster on her knee, but favouring rather more traditional white pumps. What to do when you know you don’t actually have to win, to win? Elina Svitolina is virtually in the semi-finals out in Singapore. All she needs to confirm her place is to win a set - just one, measly little set - against Caroline Wozniacki to ensure her progression. Trouble is, that sort of thinking can get in your head, when you know you could lose and still be OK. Even if you continue to go all-out and blaze away for the win, the nagging thoughts might appear.For Wozniacki, things are clearer. She needs to win, and (I think - the WTA website is not the clearest) win in straight sets to have any chance of progressing, after Karolina Pliskova’s win over Petra Kvitova earlier on this morning.So, then. Let’s see how this pans out. And let’s see if I’ve got those permutations right..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfc662dad7f066f42c3955e0dfa1c46d59fb066e/0_57_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=537b8a16b02bafd4fb5272e551630c7b","title":"brett kavanaugh eureka club noel francisco emails","story":"The new supreme court justice was a member of the Eureka club with Noel Francisco, who argues government cases before courtBrett Kavanaugh, the new supreme court justice, counts the Trump administration’s solicitor general, who will be arguing cases before the high court on behalf of the president, as a close professional friend, according to emails that offer new insights into an all-male dinner club that Kavanaugh used to attend.Emails obtained by the  show that Kavanaugh, who was narrowly confirmed to the supreme court earlier this month, participated in monthly evening cocktails and dinners from 2001 to 2003 with a group of men that included Noel Francisco, who now serves as the Trump administration’s solicitor general. It is not clear whether the dinners continued after Kavanaugh became a federal judge in 2006.Other attendees included a lawyer who is now a top strategic adviser to Rupert Murdoch, the author of the George W Bush-era “torture memos” that were used to justify illegal interrogation techniques, and two lawyers who now regularly appear before the supreme court on behalf of corporate clients.The so-called “Eureka” dinners – named after the college that Ronald Reagan attended – were briefly raised in a written question that was submitted to Kavanaugh by senators following his initial confirmation hearing. Asked what the Eureka Club was, Kavanaugh said in a written response: “A group of friends sometimes gathered for dinner. The scheduling emails for those dinners would sometimes be titled ‘Eureka’.”What Kavanaugh’s answer did not fully explain was that the dinners were attended by an elite group of men closely associated with the Federalist Society, the rightwing organization that has played a major role in vetting and choosing judicial appointments for Republican presidents since its founding in 1982.While Kavanaugh has stated his desire to mentor and promote women to the top ranks of the legal profession, there is no evidence that any woman was ever invited to a Eureka dinner, based on the emails the  obtained.While it would not have been improper for Kavanaugh and other like-minded Bush administration officials to regularly meet for dinner and drinks at that time, new revelations about the identity of his circle of professional friends raise questions about how the close-knit relationships Kavanaugh forged with other lawyers might influence his rulings in the future.Richard Painter, a critic of Donald Trump who served as the Bush administration’s ethics lawyer from 2005-2007, said senators should have sought more information about the Eureka dinners before Kavanaugh’s confirmation, especially if he continued to attend the regular dinners as a judge on the DC circuit court of appeals.“For a judge to have regular meetings with certain lawyers is very problematic but apparently the question was never asked,” Painter said.The Eureka emails seen by the  cover a limited period while Kavanaugh worked for the White House under George W Bush.They show that the dinner companions who Kavanaugh described as “friends” include Viet Dinh, who now serves as a senior legal adviser to Rupert Murdoch and is a godfather to Lachlan Murdoch’s child John Yoo, who wrote the so-called “torture memos” and Robert Coughlin, the former deputy chief of staff at the Department of Justice who pleaded guilty to a conflict of interest crime related to the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. Coughlin was disbarred but reinstated as a lawyer in 2016.Paul Clement, a lawyer at the firm of Kirkland \u0026amp Ellis who frequently appears before the supreme court, also attended.The emails indicate that the men met on the first Monday of every month, usually reserving a table at Bobby Vans restaurant, though they appeared to prefer the Caucus Room, an upscale steakhouse. The dinners were often arranged by Adam Ciongoli, who served as an adviser to then-attorney general John Ashcroft and now works as general counsel of Campbell Soup. Ciongoli is also a member of the Federalist Society.Emails show that the events sometimes included unspecified “special guests”. Several attendees who were approached by the  declined to comment. They did not dispute that judges were among the special guests who were invited. Eugene Scalia, the conservative lawyer and son of the late Antonin Scalia, the supreme court justice who is considered the ideological father of the Federalist Society, was also included on the Eureka emails. Scalia is a lawyer at Gibson Dunn in Washington whose specialty is labor law.Asked about solicitor general Noel Francisco’s attendance at the meetings and his friendship with Kavanaugh, Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for the Department of Justice, said: “We encourage judges and advocates to dine, meet and discuss issues of the day here. The SG is often colloquially called the 10th justice of the court … I would say that most SGs have had close relationships with justices including the ones they clerked for, which includes reunions, dinners and frequent calls.”But Painter, the ethics lawyer, said the DoJ’s stance was problematic, because it did not emphasize that any litigant before the supreme court needed to be treated equally, and that the solicitor general, who is meant to defend the president’s legal position on any case, ought not to have special sway.“That statement should have pointed out that there should never be ex parte communications,” Painter said, referring to communications about a case between a lawyer and a judge that occurs outside the presence of opposing counsel.Alex Azar, who now serves as the secretary of health and human services, also attended the dinners. Azar has oversight of the Trump administration’s claimed effort to reunite parents with children who were separated from them under the White House’s “zero-tolerance” immigration policies. Azar also has oversight of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the healthcare law known as Obamacare. Both issues could come before the court.Another attendee, according to emails, was Gregory Garre, who served as an assistant to the solicitor general during Bush’s first term and is now a partner at Latham \u0026amp Watkins. Garre has argued 43 cases before the supreme court. In 2010, Kavanaugh ruled in favour of Garre’s client, an e-cigarrette maker called Sottera, in a case Garre argued before the DC court of appeals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places. Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world.

There’s a lot at stake for the citizens in Hesse.”Such a loss in a former SPD heartland would be a serious blow to the party, particularly so soon after the result in Bavaria. It could be the shock that finally prompts the SPD leadership to yield to party voices urging it to withdraw from Merkel’s coalition in Berlin, forcing national elections.“The grand coalition is a symptom of a problem that’s bigger than itself,” Kevin Kühnert, head of the SPD’s youth wing, told Der Spiegel in a recent interview. “But if we have the feeling the coalition can’t be saved and that no substantive work is possible, then we have to draw a line underneath it. At some point we have to decide on that.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3675451.1540479550!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"department signed off on rapid build schools says building firm","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar with Vivienne Bourke, principal of St. Luke’s National School and Tim Stapleton, principal of Tyrrelstown Educate Together during a visit. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins Dublin.The building firm at the centre of controversy over schools which have been shut due to structural concerns has insisted that the Department of Education signed off on each project.Safety checks are being conducted over the coming days on more than 40 schools built over the past decade or more by Western Building Systems (WBS) following the closure of three schools this week.In a statement, the firm said department contracts stipulated that the three schools should be completed within a timeframe of 20-26 weeks.“We met these timelines as per our contractual obligations. The department itself deemed each project to be fully compliant, issuing the supporting certificates of completion,” it said.It added that wrote to the Minister for Education on Wednesday seeking an “urgent meeting”. “We were subsequently contacted to meet with department representatives today. We welcome this development as it allows for a better understanding of why these three schools, previously deemed compliant by the department, have now been closed,” it said.“Mindful of pupils, parents and teachers, we are determined to work with the Department to get to the bottom of this matter.”However, the department has insisted that the contractor and its design team were “fully responsible for the construction and certification of the buildings” in accordance with the regulations in force at the time. It said the role of department representatives during periodic site visits was as “client liaison”. The department said their responsibilities included reporting on progress to the department and ensuring the contractor was aware of any particular project or school requirements. “This should not be construed as removing the responsibility from the contractor and its design teams for detailed quality control and certification of the buildings,” it said .Concerns first arose over schools built by the WBS in 2015 when fire safety defects were uncovered.This led to a check on 30 schools built by the firm which, in turn, uncovered structural concerns last week.The firm said it has “responded in full” to reports for 20 of these schools and it is awaiting receipt of 10 outstanding reports.In the meantime, WBS says it is engaging in the assessment process for the three closed schools, Ardgillan Community College, Tyrrelstown Educate Together National School and St Luke’s National School, Mulhuddart. There was relief on Wednesday evening when the structural inspection of Gaelscoil Teach Giúise in Firhouse, Dublin – built last year – did not reveal any significant issues. This may suggest that schools built in more recent years were of a higher standard.Most concern will now focus on the 30 or so schools built by WBS during the department’s “rapid-build” programme between 2007 and 2013. Minister for Education Joe McHugh has said it is likely that more schools would be ordered to close over the coming days. These decisions will be based on the outcomes of structural safety checks which are due to take place before the return of schools after the mid-term break.The Government, meanwhile, is “working night and day” to establish the extent of structural risks in school buildings, the Taoiseach pledged as he visited one of the impacted sites. Leo Varadkar said all the facts were still not known as he toured Tyrrelstown Educate Together School and St Luke’s on Thursday morning.“This is a big problem, we don’t necessarily know the scale of it yet, but we do know that we will fix it, we are going to make sure that everything is put right,” said Mr Varadkar.The Taoiseach said initial assessments had indicated there were no concerns about state hospital and healthcare facilities built by the company. Mr Varadkar acknowledged the issue with school buildings had created concern among parents. “We don’t have all the answers yet but what we are going to do over the next couple of days is find out what the scale of the problem is, put in place interim solutions that hopefully will allow the schools to continue to operate, and then carry out whatever repairs that need to be carried out and get things back to normal as soon as we can,” he said. “I know this is a time of enormous concern and worry for parents and I know this is really discommoding and really disruptive for children, particular for those with special needs and other needs, but we are working night and day now to make sure we find out the scale of the problem and put in place solutions that will ideally allow the schools to continue on campus and then carry out any permanent works that are needed to put things right and get things back to normal.” The issue has arisen ahead of the mid-term break, with officials hopeful of having a clearer picture of the situation before pupils return to classrooms after Halloween. Mr Varadkar said interim solutions being considered included the installation of temporary classrooms and the use of alternative nearby facilities. “Every solution is going to be different in each locality,” he added. Mr McHugh said the safety of pupils and staff was the Government’s “foremost concern”. “We are going to work really, really hard to find an interim solution,” he added. A s search is currently under way to find temporary accommodation for the 1,200 students affected by the closure of two primary schools in Tyrrelstown, Dublin.It is understood that Blanchardstown Further Education and Training has offered space to students, while officials are also examining the use of spare capacity in secondary schools. It is likely that pupils will be spread across a number of locations following the mid-term break.Structural engineers have told department officials that engineering solutions can put in place to manage the structural risks to buildings so far.It is uncertain how long these steps could take, with some education sources indicating it could take up to next summer to complete remedial works in some cases."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3673899.1540400917!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"full list of schools facing structural inspections","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tArdgillan Community College in Balbriggan: school has asked some pupils to stay home over health and safety concerns arising from construction.

Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins Every morning, Olga Morgan, a stay-at-home mother of five, prepares her son Andy (6) for a taxi that takes him from their home in Clonee, Co Meath, to Tyrrelstown Educate Together National School. Andy, who is non-verbal and attends a specialised autism unit at the school, relies on this routine. He is also one of 1,200 pupils from the campus – shared with St Luke’s National School – displaced by the schools’ indefinite closing this week following structural assessment inspections carried out for the Department of Education. When Andy’s taxi did not pick him up for school Wednesday morning, he began pacing up and down ripping things climbing crying. “A total meltdown,” Morgan called it. “He knows he should be in school,” she said. “I’m up the walls . . . My son could have a regression because of this.”Morgan spends most days taking care of her adult son Anthony (26), who has Cerebral Palsy, but spent Wednesday morning struggling to contain Andy, who she says was “bouncing off the walls”. Anthony even had to wait 40 minutes to use the bathroom while his mother corralled Andy. With midterm break next week, Morgan has already been preparing for days at home taking care of Anthony, Andy, and her daughter Sophie (10). Her main concern now is how long the school will be closed, and how it could negatively affect Andy’s education. “With a child with autism, you have to accept a school that has a place available, where the waitlists can take years,” Morgan said. “You can cope for a day or two, but when you don’t know how long it’s going to be, it’s very difficult.”Parents were on hand at the school Wednesday afternoon for an impromptu car-park meeting with Matthew Waine, a Solidarity councillor for the Mulhuddart Ward on Fingal County Council. Waine has spoken to construction experts who suggest the building could be closed for months. If the schools have to relocate, he fears there is not nearby infrastructure in place to support an appropriate education environment. “There’s a stony silence from everyone,” he said. “The department hasn’t really said anything. Schools haven’t said anything. What are you going to do with 1,200 students? Where are they going to go?”Parents at the meeting were concerned that moving to a new school could throw off their work schedules, and expressed worry regarding the educational difficulties of changing schools and programmes. “Even if they find another place for the kids to go – and I have a hard time believing they will – I’m worried it will be too far and won’t suit us,” said Giulia Romoli, a parent attending the meeting. Charlie Cleary, a stay-at-home father of two whose sons attend Educate Together, was concerned about his sons assimilating to a new school environment with unfamiliar surroundings, teachers and students. “This is an absolute, complete disaster,” he said. “The worst part is the kids will be separated throughout Dublin 15. They will be forced to blend in. My guess is a lot of kids will do it, more won’t be able to.” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish is spoken in house of commons for first time in more than 100 years","story":"  October 24, 2018Plaid Cymru MP is one of only a few MPs to use Irish in the House of Commons   October 25, 2018, 1901: \u0026lsquoAn angry yell of indignant astonishment arose from the Irish benches\u0026rsquo "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3675343.1540463902!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"airbnb permission unlikely in high demand areas says murphy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Housing, Planning and Local Government Eoghan Murphy TD. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe It is “unlikely” permission will be given for landlords to use properties as short-term lets, such as Airbnbs, in areas where there is a high demand for housing, Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy has said. On Thursday the department announced new regulations for short-term lettings, which had been under consideration for some time and will not come into force until next June. The Minister said that between 1,000 and 3,000 homes in the greater Dublin area, which are currently available for holiday lettings, could come back into the long-term rental market as a result of the measure. The aim, he said, was to “unlock stock”. Under the new restrictions, owners of buy-to-let properties will have to get planning permission from local councils if they want to use their second homes or apartments for short-term lets, for more than three months every year.Councils will have the power to refuse permission to owners of such properties to use them for full-time, short-term lettings. However, Mr Murphy said in “areas of high housing demand” it will be “unlikely that permission would be granted. “Unless it’s your own home you can’t put it out for short term letting,” he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. “This is an emergency response. We are announcing it now to give plenty of time to plan.” Only owners of second properties will have to apply to councils for permission. Owner-occupiers will face no restrictions in letting inidual rooms in their houses for short-term stays, but will only be able to let their entire homes for three months in a year. The 90-day limit will apply over a calendar year for short-term bookings of two weeks or less at a time. In these cases, homeowners will have to inform their local authority the number of days, and specific periods, their home was let for at the end of each year. Each local authority will maintain a register of properties being used for short-term lets, to help inform officials of the effect of the practice on the wider housing market.The regulations were introduced as the popularity of short-term lets, aimed at tourists, “has resulted in some professional landlords withdrawing houses and apartments” from the traditional rental market, Mr Murphy said. “This is an unregulated activity, it is not homesharing as it is typically understood, and in a time of housing shortage it is unacceptable that rental homes would be withdrawn from the letting market,” he said. “The reforms being presented here aim to bring homes, once available on the traditional rental market, back into typical long-term renting.” In a statement, Airbnb said the online platform “didn’t cause Ireland’s historic housing concerns.” A spokeswoman for the company said “many will be disheartened to hear a false promise that these proposals are the solution.” The spokeswoman added the restrictions on lettings would hurt local economies supported by tourism. The new regulations will not affect properties that have planning permission for use as holiday or bed and breakfast accommodation. Long-term “rent a room” schemes, such as student digs, will not be affected by the changes. Property owners found to be breaching the regulations will risk criminal prosecution. Extra resources will be provided to Dublin City Council, where short-term letting is popular, to help enforce the new rules.The draft regulations will be reviewed by the Oireachtas, and are to be finalised by the end of the year. Adrian Cummins, head of the Restaurants Association of Ireland, welcomed the regulations, due to difficulties facing staff in the sector finding housing. However, Mr Cummins said there was “a concern” that the measures would affect tourism, and increase hotel room prices.Homeless charity Peter McVerry Trust welcomed the changes, which it said would have a small but positive impact. The organisation said there should be a “blanket ban” on approving permission for short-term lettings by councils, until there was a “sustained and dramatic” improvement of the housing crisis, a spokeswoman said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3675446.1540467025!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit revenue updating it systems for no deal scenario","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe.

Mr Donohoe said the staff being made available was in line with Revenue requirements. “They want 200 by March 2019 and the balance across the transitionary period,” which was being worked on by the EU and UK.Mr McGrath asked: “What extra resources do Revenue need if this all goes wrong, if we have a cliff edge Brexit and we have no deal by March 2019?”The Minister told him that “the consequences of being in that place stretch beyond resourcing for all of the European Union”.That was why work on the evaluation and upscaling of IT systems was so important.“We will have a technology platform that will be able to deal with the different scenarios.”But he said if there was no agreement “the consequences for the EU as a whole will be exceptionally significant”.He said: “The European Commission at the moment is looking at how different papers in relation to how different member states will handle a no deal scenario in different policy area.“We would have to get an indication from the Article 50 taskforce that we are in a no deal spectrum and to date that guidance has not been provided.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: The White House\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t\u0027I knew few people as skilled at explaining the mood of the Arab street and the intricacies of Arab politics\u0027 as Jamal Khashoggi, above. Photograph: Johnny GreenPA WireI first met Jamal Khashoggi in January 1992, when we were both covering the military coup that prevented the Islamic Salvation Front winning parliamentary elections in Algeria. \u0026nbspIn the coffee shop of the El Djazair Hotel, Jamal told me about an exciting young preacher who had helped to drive the Soviets out of Afghanistan and who was building a following across the Arab world. His name was Osama bin Laden. Jamal had interviewed him, and helped western correspondents meet bin Laden in Sudan and later in Afghanistan.It would be easy to misunderstand Jamal’s admiration for the man who would mastermind the 911 attacks. Our conversation took place seven years before al-Qaeda bombed US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and nearly a decade before 911. When I met Jamal, bin Laden and the mujahideen he led in Afghanistan had not completed the transformation from CIA and Saudi proteges into the world’s most wanted terrorists.Bin Laden was incensed that the Saudi royal family had invited tens of thousands of “infidels” to the cradle of Islam to combat Saddam Hussein in 1991. Bin Laden’s two main arguments – that the House of Saud was corrupt and unworthy to guard the holy places, and that the US played a destructive role in the Middle East – were immensely appealing to many Arabs, including Jamal.After Jamal’s death, the New York Times reported that he mourned the assassination of Bin Laden by US commandos in Pakistan in 2011. “I collapsed crying a while ago, heartbroken for you, Abu Abdullah, ” Jamal tweeted, referring to bin Laden as “father of Abdullah”. “You were beautiful and brave in those beautiful days in Afghanistan, before you surrendered to hatred and passion.”To me, Jamal Khashoggi was just a friendly, helpful colleague whom I was pleased to run into when reporting stories. I knew few people as skilled at explaining the mood of the Arab street and the intricacies of Arab politics. He somehow embodied more than half a century of Arab history: frustration and impotence over the fate of the Palestinians the temptation of radicalism the necessity of finding a modus vivendi with dictators the search for an accommodation between religious faith and freedom.The last time I saw Jamal, more than 20 years ago, we had lunch in Cairo with his Saudi wife, from whom he was orced at the time of his death. She was a pretty, petite woman, dressed from head to toe in a white headscarf and long-sleeved robe. We spoke briefly about their children, after which talk turned to Middle Eastern politics and she fell silent.In Algiers, Jamal wore slacks and a jacket, as he did on October 2nd, when he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. In Cairo he wore a long, white Saudi dishdasha and Arab headdress. It was as if he became more Arab, more Muslim, the closer he travelled to the heart of the Arab and Muslim world. He was a chameleon who impressed western friends with his easy-going manner and the English he mastered at Indiana State University. Muslims noticed his piety.He was by no means a zealot. The New York Times published a photograph of him at a Thanksgiving dinner in Washington last year. There were a half dozen wine bottles on the table, yet Jamal tweeted the photo to his 1.7 million followers – something no Islamic fundamentalist would ever do.Jamal lived astride fault lines between east and west, and between establishment and radical Islam. Any seismologist will tell you that the fault line is the most dangerous place to be. To advise Saudi princes, as Jamal did, was a plunge into shark-infested waters. \u0026nbspJamal supported the Muslim Brotherhood, which was mercilessly repressed in Egypt and Syria over decades. The Saudi monarchy also supported the Brotherhood, until it backed Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s overthrow of Egypt’s democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, in 2013.If Christian democracy was possible in Europe, why could Arabs not be ruled by Muslim democracy, Jamal asked. That may explain his friendship with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who on Tuesday denounced Jamal’s “savage murder” by the Saudis. Erdogan constituted the greatest hope of Muslim democracy, until he too turned into a despot.It’s a strange feeling to learn that a colleague you knew and liked died atrociously. I have been surprised and heartened at the scale of the international reaction to Jamal’s murder. One hopes that something good may come of it.

against the door.But their attempts at self-preservation were sadly in vain and all five died as the building was engulfed in volcanic ash and collapsed.The skeletons were discovered in the same villa where archeologists last week found a charcoal inscription that suggested that the eruption of Vesuvius happened in October AD 79, not August of that year, as previously thought.The women and children would have barricaded themselves inside the house because by then there was no chance of fleeing Pompeii – the ash had been falling for 18 hours, homes were covered in debris and streets were blocked with ash and pumice, said Massimo Osanna, the director of Pompeii.“The place where they took shelter must have seemed safe,” Prof Osanna said.The skeletons are believed to belong to two women and three childrenInstead, their lives were soon after snuffed out by the devastating impact of the volcano’s eruption.“They were crushed by the roof when it collapsed, or burned by the pyroclastic cloud, or perhaps a combination of both those things,” he said.Not far from the skeletons, archeologists made another intriguing discovery – a 17th century coin, suggesting that the villa was partially explored by tomb-raiders decades before official excavations began in 1748.The effect of tunneling and digging by early tomb raiders was “devastating”, Prof Osanna said.“The objective was to find any objects of value, without paying any regard at all for human remains, which they disturbed.”Pompeii is undergoing a new phase of excavations, the most intensive since the 1950s, with extraordinary finds coming to light almost every month.A new phase of excavations at Pompeii has unearthed some stunning frescoes and mosaicsThe EU-funded project has unearthed villas decorated with frescoes and mosaics depicting Roman gods and goddesses and animals such as crocodiles, snakes, deer and peacocks.Despite more than 250 years of intermittent excavations, a third of Pompeii still remains to be explored.The discovery of the charcoal inscription last week suggested that Mt Vesuvius did not erupt on August 24, AD 79, but two months later.The inscription was found along with other bits of writing, much of it ribald. “On the walls of the atrium and corridor of the villa there is a notable quantity of graffiti, which is still being studied, with phrases that are in some cases of an obscene character, archeologists said in a statement.Please review our commenting policyPeople who wear white poppies are \u0026#39attention seekers\u0026#39 hijacking symbol to push their own agenda, MP saysPentagon sends 800 troops to US-Mexico border as migrant caravan advances\u0026#39French Spiderman\u0026#39 climbs 46-storey Heron Tower in London with no ropeWomen now able to join the SAS as defence secretary opens all roles in Armed Forces to both sexesSir Philip Green named in Parliament as businessman at centre of Britain\u0026#39s #MeToo scandalNon-disclosure agreements: Everything you need to know about NDAs (and their misuse)Brexit latest: Risk of no deal due to EU \u0026#39intransigence,\u0026#39 warns Dominic Raab -live updatesSoros university says it is being forced out of Hungary and may have to enroll new students in Vienna Watch as Sir Philip Green is named in Parliament as businessman at centre of Britain\u0026#39s #MeToo scandalWhy there\u0026#39s a spike in mountain rescue call-outs when the clocks go backStudent union president causes outrage after vowing to take down war memorial mural because it contains only white menComment: White poppies aren\u0026#39t for peace-lovers.

It has argued there is a clear public interest in publishing the claims, not least to alert those who might be applying to work for him.However, the Court of Appeal has ruled against this newspaper which, like the alleged victims, now finds itself gagged.The accused man has hired a team of at least seven lawyers and spent close to £500,000 in legal fees to persuade the Court of Appeal to injunct The . He is being represented by Schillings, the legal firm which has also worked with Cristiano Ronaldo, Lance Armstrong and Ryan Giggs, iniduals who have controversially made use of NDAs or injunctions to silence accusations of wrongdoing.On Tuesday, in the latest twist in a legal fight which began in July, the court ruled that the confidentiality of contracts was more important than freedom of speech. It overturned a previous High Court ruling – which can now be reported for the first time – which found that publication of the allegations would be overwhelmingly in the public interest and would significantly contribute to debate in a democratic society.In the earlier High Court case, Justice Haddon-Cave, who is one of the country’s top terror judges, concluded that “in all the circumstances, the public interest in publication outweighs any confidentiality attaching to the information”.He believed the information – the allegations made against the businessman – to be “reasonably credible” and said their publication of the information “would be in the public interest”.The Appeal Court judges hearing the case were Sir Terence, as Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Underhill and Lord Justice Henderson – all of whom have a background in contract law and one also in employment law.The Daily  front page on WednesdayHowever, the Appeal Court judges disagreed with the High Court’s ruling and stressed the importance of legally-binding contracts.“The Judge has, however, left entirely out of account the important and legitimate role played by non-disclosure agreements in the consensual settlement of disputes, both generally but in particular in the employment field.”The ruling said that at this interim stage the judges concluded it is “likely” the businessman may establish that his right to keep these matters confidential may outweigh any public interest, adding “there is a real prospect that publication by the  will cause immediate, substantial and possibly irreversible harm to all of the Claimants.”The Court of Appeal has ordered that the matter proceed to a speedy trial.Support investigative journalism from The  with a digital subscription. Start your free 30-day trial today. People who wear white poppies are \u0026#39attention seekers\u0026#39 hijacking symbol to push their own agenda, MP saysPentagon sends 800 troops to US-Mexico border as migrant caravan advances\u0026#39French Spiderman\u0026#39 climbs 46-storey Heron Tower in London with no ropeWomen now able to join the SAS as defence secretary opens up all roles in Armed Forces to both sexesNon-disclosure agreements: Everything you need to know about NDAs (and their misuse)Brexit latest: Risk of no deal due to EU \u0026#39intransigence,\u0026#39 warns Dominic Raab -live updatesSoros university says it is being forced out of Hungary and may have to enroll new students in Vienna Watch as Sir Philip Green is named in Parliament as businessman at centre of Britain\u0026#39s #MeToo scandalPompeii dig finds intact skeletons of two women and three children huddled togetherWhy there\u0026#39s a spike in mountain rescue call-outs when the clocks go backStudent union president causes outrage after vowing to take down war memorial mural because it contains only white menComment: White poppies aren\u0026#39t for peace-lovers.

Within a few years, it would be worth more than $10 billion and would eventually peak above $300 billion – surpassing the market cap of the payments giant Visa.Yet despite this success, bitcoin and the thousands of cryptocurrencies that have since appeared are still largely a fringe technology, unable to truly break into the mainstream. On its 10th anniversary,\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspspoke to a number of crypto experts who explain why this is and suggest how this might be about\u0026nbspto change.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearWhile bitcoin has taken off and is seen as the leader of the cryptocurrency market, it’s been adopted by the few not the many, said Chakib Bouda, chief technology officer at US-based payments firm Rambus.Confusion amongst users has played a part, but arguably the biggest failings for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the past years lies with security, in the first six months of 2018 alone over $761 million bitcoin was stolen, with experts predicting that the amount stolen from exchanges will top $1.5 billion by the end of the year.The key to overcoming this issues, Bouda\u0026nbspsuggested, is keeping the private keys needed to access and use cryptocurrency funds both secure and easy-to-use.\u0026nbsp One way of doing this would be adopting technology used within the traditional financial sector to bring cryptocurrencies up to the levels of security and usability that people expect of a modern currency.Once this secure ecosystem is in place, it’s going to transform how many sceptics view bitcoin transactions, Bouda said. So whilst cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have been described as the ‘Wild West’ by the UK treasury, we expect that in 10 years’ time, bitcoin will become mainstream and have a remarkably different reputation.If bitcoin is able to transform its reputation in this way, bitcoin could find its way into everyone\u0027s pockets through mobile wallets –achieving\u0026nbspmainstream adoption\u0026nbspin time for bitcoin\u0027s next\u0026nbspbirthday.It\u0027s a view shared by Iqbal Gandham, the UK managing director of the online trading platform eToro. The next decade could see bitcoin being accepted as the norm when it comes to money transfer and payments, he said. As with any startup idea, early days are always risky, but I feel these are now few and far between.Alternatively, if another cryptocurrency is able to become a safe and\u0026nbspconvenient payment method\u0026nbspbefore bitcoin developers implement the necessary technology, bitcoin\u0027s place as the world\u0027s most popular cryptocurrency could be usurped.This is the view of Nigel Green, founder and CEO of the deVere\u0026nbspGroup, a financial consultancy firm based in London. Mr Green suggested that bitcoin\u0027s influence will drastically reduce in the cryptocurrency sector, however the overall crypto market will expand by at least 5,000 per cent.“Bitcoin is what kickstarted the crypto revolution and it has changed the way the world handles money, makes transactions, does business, and manages assets, amongst other things, forever.\u0026nbsp It all began with bitcoin, Mr Green said.\u0026nbsp“However, whilst I don’t wish to rain on anyone’s parade, I believe that\u0026nbspbitcoin’s influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector will drastically reduce in its second decade.\u0026nbspThis is because as mass adoption of cryptocurrency grows, more and more digital assets will be launched – by organisations in both the private and the public sectors. This will increase competition for bitcoin and dent its market share.He continued: “In addition, it is likely that bitcoin will be hit by the superior technology, features, and problem-solutions, offered by existing and yet-to-be-released cryptocurrencies.”If the deVere\u0026nbspCEO\u0027s forecast is correct, the boost from\u0026nbspmajor institutional and retail investors will see the cryptocurrency market rocket towards\u0026nbspthe $20 trillion mark by 2028.Financial institutions and regulators, amongst others, understand that cryptocurrencies are the future of money, he concluded.\u0026nbsp“As such, the market will have grown beyond recognition when bitcoin celebrates its 20th anniversary.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And what does this turmoil mean for Saudi’s economic modernisation dreams? Ben Chu reports from the Future Investment Initiative in RiyadhClick to followThe IndependentThe Saudi delegates, many of them working for state companies, were on message about the regimeIf you wanted to build a room in which to conceal an elephant it would probably have the dimensions of\u0026nbspthe opulent main hall of the King Abduaziz International conference centre in Riyadh.The classical marble columns framing the rectangular space must be at least seven\u0026nbspmetres high. Crystal chandeliers hang from the stuccoed ceiling like enormous frozen explosions of bling. Everything is almost comically oversized.Everything we know about the death of Jamal KhashoggiBut even this aircraft hanger-sized Saudi Arabian ballroom could not hide one pachyderm this week: the killing of the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom’s embassy in Istanbul earlier this month.Few spoke about it, but everyone was staring at it.The Saudi “Future Investment Initiative” – the\u0026nbsp“Davos in the desert” – was conceived as a way to suck foreign investment into the Saudi economy and to make a reality of the 33-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s “Vision 2030” economic reforms.But while “MBS”, as he is known, wants to attract foreign cash and foreign technical expertise he also wants foreign interest, foreign enthusiasm for a modernising Saudi Arabia.Before the conference began that seemed to be a dream that had been extinguished, along with the life of Khashoggi.Bosses from some of the world’s biggest corporations and financial companies – Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, Stephen\u0026nbspSchwarzman of Blackstone, Larry Fink of BlackRock, Masayoshi Son of Softbank to name but a few – dropped out in the wake of Khashoggi’s killing and the global wave of abhorrence about an act apparently ordered from Riyadh. Politicians did the same, from the US Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, to Christine Lagarde of the IMF, to our own trade secretary, Liam Fox.It was one of the most impressive no-show\u0026nbsplists in the history of parties.Yet anyone who had assumed that the conference\u0026nbspin the heart of the Saudi capital, which began on Tuesday,\u0026nbspwould have been a purely domestic, or regional, affair was mistaken. Chinese money managers and Indian business people had either not got the memo about the boycott, or did not care to join.\u0026nbspAnd there were a fair number of Western business delegates here in the sprawling Riyadh conference centre, although they tended to have less exalted titles such as “chief scientific officer” and “vice president international ision”. \u0026nbspMany were keeping a low profile and spoke about the Khashoggi case only obliquely as “the political situation”.“It’s not a good situation if the facts are as they seem,” said one Indian private equity magnate, sucking his teeth.Yet others were privately less concerned. “Look it was a mistake – but China does this kind of thing all the time and yet they get praised them for being a huge infrastructure investor across the world,” complained one American. The Saudi delegates, many of them working for state companies, were on message.Most of the sessions, despite the lavish video presentations that accompanied them, were rather sparsely attended, with people preferring the mingle in small groups over Arabic tea in the\u0026nbspcorridors of the centre.But the 1,400 capacity hall was packed for the crown prince’s panel, where he would make his first public remarks since Khashoggi’s death.The stage management was not very subtle. Many of the delegates were wearing the traditional Saudi ankle-length white shirt and red-patterned headdress and a glance at their ID lanyards showed that many worked for state – or state-linked – Saudi firms. They cheered loudly\u0026nbspthe prince’s rather defiant statements and responded to his\u0026nbspjokes with ostentatious laughter.The\u0026nbspmotivation for the defiance was clear.\u0026nbspThe US and Turkey have brought extreme pressure on MBS over the killing. But there was also a clear domestic message too: “I’m not going to be toppled.”It’s not a fantastical proposition. The crown prince has alienated a lot of powerful Saudis – a year ago he locked dozens of them, including princes, in the Ritz-Carlton hotel, right next door to the very conference centre in which he was speaking, until they agreed to hand back assets to the state which they were accused of corruptly appropriating. Whatever the truth about the legitimacy of their claims to those assets, this was hardly a model of open justice and transparent government.Will it work? Did bin Salman shore up his position with his words?But, despite reports from Turkey this week that President Recep\u0026nbspTayyip\u0026nbspErdogan\u0026nbspis not set on regime change in Riyadh, Ankara seems determined to turn up the pressure on MBS\u0026nbspfurther over the killing. And, of course, nothing said before a friendly audience in Riyadh is likely to sway the\u0026nbspthe White House and its erratic occupant.It seems fair to say that the fate of the crown prince remains in the balance.And so, inevitably, does that of his ambitious economic reforms, which include building a $500bn high-tech city in the desert and turning the kingdom into a tourist hub to rival Dubai.The crown prince boasted of $50bn of inward investment deals signed with Western energy and infrastructure firms at the conference. But there was little detail and some analysts said some were likely to have been projects that had already been announced.We will likely not know for many months how much damage has been done by the Khashoggi affair to the appetite of Western firms to invest in the kingdom. The irony is that few would deny that bin Salman has identified the right economic strategy – ersification away from the liquefied dinosaur export business known as oil. Around 40 per cent of the kingdom’s GDP and 90 per cent of Riyadh’s\u0026nbsptax revenues come\u0026nbspfrom fossil fuels at present. That is a precarious position in a world in which there is now a broadening (if not total) consensus that decarbonisation is environmentally and economically necessary. Jamal Khashoggi death ‘the worst cover up ever’Another rather bitter irony is that MBS’s\u0026nbspsocial reforms seem genuinely popular, especially among younger people.One single female Saudi economic consultant stressed to me over lunch in the heaving dining room of the Ritz-Carlton how important the granting of the freedom for women to drive cars was.“Before I had to have a driver. Now I can travel to meetings on my own. And it’s changing attitudes too. Men must now look at us as human beings not objects,” she said.“It’s a sexual revolution – I’m not joking,” said one European-based energy executive who comes to Saudi around 100 days every year. “You should tell your readers about that!”Yet MBS has not been a political reformer. Most non-partisan observers agree that the political realm is now\u0026nbspslammed shut. And the Khashoggi killing has sent a terrifying message to those who might have been minded to criticise the\u0026nbspregime.Another irony is that amid the uproar over the killing of Khashoggi another story has gone ignored. The United Nations warned this week that Yemen, where Saudi forces are attempting to suppresses a Houthi insurgency through a blockade, is on the brink of a “massive loss of life” due to famine.That, alas, was an elephant in the room that everyone at this week’s tense conference in the Arabian desert seemed to manage to ignore without any difficulty at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The CPS has issued European Arrest Warrants for the extradition in connection with the Novichok poisoning attack on Sergei Skripal The store closures will bring the Debenhams estate down to about 100 locations and come on top of 10 earmarked earlier this year.As part of the shake-up, Mr Bucher will attempt to take £130m\u0026nbspof costs out of the business, including suspending the idend.Sales for the year also slipped 1.8 per cent\u0026nbspto £2.9bn, while like-for-like revenue fell 2.3 per cent.Despite the dire\u0026nbspresults, some analysts point\u0026nbspto positives for the department store chain.Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Debenhams\u0026nbspis capitalising on a growing consumer preference for experiences over material goods.The chain has installed gyms and food outlets in a bid to make the most out of the large amount of floorspace it has.\u0026nbsp“The retailer is also investing in improved customer service, which is vitally important, as this is something digital-only players can’t replicate,” Mr Khalaf said.“Debenhams is also focused on its online offering, which is bearing fruit and growing strongly, albeit not enough to outweigh declines on the high street.”Debenhams’ problems come as a raft of retailers including New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare also embark on store closure programmes.Chancellor Philip Hammond\u0026nbsphas a chance to reduce the pain for retailers with tax changes in his Budget announcement next week.He is rumoured to be considering giving retailers a £300m\u0026nbspbusiness rates cut for town centres that have been particularly badly hit by the shift to online sales.But leading retail figures want the chancellor to do more. Last month, Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis urged ministers to implement a £1.25bn “Amazon tax” for online sales.Mr Bucher told the BBC on Thursday: “I promise my 26,000 staff that we will try to protect as many jobs as we can.\u0026nbspAs our numbers show, we are a publicly solvent business.“I think it’s no surprise that customers have shifted online, they buy less in store, they buy more online.“That is the issue we are addressing with our announcement today. We want to have fewer but better stores.”Mr Bucher\u0026nbspdeclined to say which stores he planned to close.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The pound dropped 0.5 per cent to $1.29, the lowest level since early September.Connor Campbell at Spreadex said sterling’s downward trajectory was “unsurprising”. “It appears that the currency has been spooked by Theresa May’s impending meeting with the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, with whom the PM hardly has the best relationship with at the moment (even before the rather violent comments reported in the papers over the weekend). A no-deal Brexit would seriously threaten our national securityBritain Before Brexit: a portrait of the country and its peopleVoters \u0027deserve a final say on Brexit\u0027, leader of EU socialists says“The outcome of that address may impact how the Brexit negotiations move forward – or don’t, as the troublesome case may be.”Over the weekend, media reports emerged with Tory rebels using aggressive and violent language to attack the prime minister, including one who warned that Ms May should “bring her own noose” if she decided to come to the 1922 meeting. MPs were quoted as saying she was now entering “the killing zone” and that “assassination is in the air”, while another unnamed Tory was quoted as saying: “The moment is coming when the knife gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted. She’ll be dead soon.” Ms May confirmed on Tuesday that she would meet with the backbench 1922 Committee.David Cheetham, chief market analyst at broker XTB, said: “May’s position is similar to that of the pound in that it seems to be carrying on despite the sizable challenges faced.If May was toppled the pound would see a wave of selling in the short-term since her replacement could increase the chances of a no-deal Brexit, Cheetham added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The companies said the pair-up is expected to be a success because Sainsbury’s and Oasis cater to very similar demographics. Two Oasis concessions will open at Sainsbury’s supermarkets before Christmas at Sydenham in south London and at Selly Oak, near Birmingham. Sainsbury\u0027s sales growth slows as it slashes pricesSainsbury’s launches new vegan range due to increasing demandMPs accuse Sainsbury’s of giving staff ultimatum over new pay dealsSainsbury’s said these two locations had been “carefully selected” because they are stores where the Tu clothing range performs “particularly strongly”. Sainsbury’s director of commercial, James Brown, said: “We are delighted to be welcoming Oasis to Sainsbury’s stores. Its on-trend fashion ranges will complement our high quality Tu clothing offer and support our strategy to make our stores leading fashion destinations.”Hash Ladha, chief executive designate of Oasis, said: “Trialling Oasis in Sainsbury’s is an exciting development for us. This is about presenting the Oasis product proposition and brand experience to Sainsbury’s customers. The customer demographic of both brands is very similar and therefore it is a natural strategic partnership.”This is the latest in a string of deals Sainsbury’s has executed in a bid to ersify its offering and grow its customer base. The retailer has previously agreed partnerships with Clarks and Specsavers. Meanwhile, the group is in the process of buying Asda, which will make it the UK’s biggest retailer, ahead of Tesco, if the deal completes. The companies are waiting for regulatory approval from the competition watchdog, which may require the closure of hundreds of stores before the takeover can go ahead. The CMA has said it will assess whether the merger “could lead to a worse outcome for shoppers through higher prices, a poorer shopping experience, or reductions in the range or quality of products offered”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They travelled on a Russian passport and it is likely that they were travelling under aliases and that these are not their real names. The CPS has issued European Arrest Warrants for the extradition in connection with the Novichok poisoning attack on Sergei Skripal The store closures will bring the Debenhams estate down to about 100 locations and come on top of 10 earmarked earlier this year.As part of the shake-up, Mr Bucher will attempt to take £130m\u0026nbspof costs out of the business, including suspending the idend.Sales for the year also slipped 1.8 per cent\u0026nbspto £2.9bn, while like-for-like revenue fell 2.3 per cent.Despite the dire\u0026nbspresults, some analysts point\u0026nbspto positives for the department store chain.Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Debenhams\u0026nbspis capitalising on a growing consumer preference for experiences over material goods.The chain has installed gyms and food outlets in a bid to make the most out of the large amount of floorspace it has.\u0026nbsp“The retailer is also investing in improved customer service, which is vitally important, as this is something digital-only players can’t replicate,” Mr Khalaf said.“Debenhams is also focused on its online offering, which is bearing fruit and growing strongly, albeit not enough to outweigh declines on the high street.”Debenhams’ problems come as a raft of retailers including New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare also embark on store closure programmes.Chancellor Philip Hammond\u0026nbsphas a chance to reduce the pain for retailers with tax changes in his Budget announcement next week.He is rumoured to be considering giving retailers a £300m\u0026nbspbusiness rates cut for town centres that have been particularly badly hit by the shift to online sales.But leading retail figures want the chancellor to do more. Last month, Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis urged ministers to implement a £1.25bn “Amazon tax” for online sales.Mr Bucher told the BBC on Thursday: “I promise my 26,000 staff that we will try to protect as many jobs as we can.\u0026nbspAs our numbers show, we are a publicly solvent business.“I think it’s no surprise that customers have shifted online, they buy less in store, they buy more online.“That is the issue we are addressing with our announcement today. We want to have fewer but better stores.”Mr Bucher\u0026nbspdeclined to say which stores he planned to close.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And for medicine, the number of EU applicants fell from 1,800 to 1,660.The fall comes despite the government’s confirmation in July that EU students enrolling in English universities in the first academic year after Brexit will pay the same tuition fees as British students.Jo Burton, a policy analyst at the Russell Group -\u0026nbspa self-selected association of twenty-four public research universities -\u0026nbspsaid: “It’s too early to say precisely what’s driving down the numbers.She added: However, given ongoing Brexit uncertainty, factors could include the lack of clarity over EU student fees, the longer duration of medicine courses and concerns over how UK qualifications will be recognised abroad once we leave the EU. The fees for EU students starting at English universities next year were only confirmed by the Government in July – just three months before the application deadline.This simply\u0026nbspisn’t enough time for many people considering international study and we urge ministers to provide clarity asap on EU fee levels for 202021 and beyond.”Professor Jenny Higham, chair of the Medical Schools Council, said: “The continued lack of clarity around leaving the EU has caused uncertainty in the higher education and healthcare sectors, both of which impact medical education and the supply of doctors.But she added: “Despite this, the new figures reveal the highest number of overall applications to medicine for many years, showing that it remains a highly attractive course and profession.\u0026nbspIn part this may be connected to the funding by government of a 25 per cent increase in places in England.\u0026nbspIt will also relate to the ongoing work medical schools do to promote the importance of the profession and its accessibility to anyone with the right attributes to become a doctor.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Daily  today reports that they were subject to a gagging order to prohibit them publishing the details of a leading businessman who is facing allegations of sexual assault and racial abuseThousands of female workers have today taken to the streets of Glasgow over an equal pay dispute with the City CouncilFormer politan Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe who has called for an urgent review of the evidence around legislation of cannabis.

It’s not a particularly special sofa: it’s navy blue, from John Lewis, and lumpy from years of people wedging their arses into the cracks between the cushions. If you sit on the chaise longue too hard, it flips like a seesaw.For three and a half years, this sofa was a sort of talisman representing everything that I loved about my old life: home, comfort and belonging.I’ve just moved back to London from Hong Kong, that rocky, typhoon-drenched island off the coast of southern China. It’s nice to be home. I’ve gone from being Theresa May’s “citizen of the world as\u0026nbspa citizen of nowhere” to being a somewhere person again.And what a strange time to be back. The irony that I moved home desperate to belong somewhere again at precisely the same time that the UK is figuring out where and how it belongs itself, is not lost on me.I left the UK at the start of 2015 with my now husband. He’d transferred with his company (HSBC – it seemed obvious we’d end up in Asia), and I’d jacked in my lovely job as an editor on a travel magazine. We’d been living in London for years since graduating and just wanted a change of scene. Friends had started to inch down the aisle and I couldn’t bear many more winters of X Factor. My East Asia experience was limited: I’d been to Shanghai in 2011 to meet a friend and had come back with an unshakeable sense that Asia was where things were moving forward, rather than stalling in Europe.Hong Kong seemed a good choice. It was exotically far-flung, but at only (only!) 6,000 miles away it was close enough to be home in 15 hours and as a former British colony, it had a reassuring vein of home running through it (crucially, the plugs were the same). Plus, as a travel editor, the prospects for fun weekends away in cities like Tokyo, Bangkok and Beijing was intoxicating. Hong Kong was hot, humid, hedonistic and so fast-paced I figured I’d have to sprint to keep up.\u0026nbspThe problem? I’m a somewhere person. I never knew how much I relied on my emotional connection to my home city to inform much of my character until I left it.Hong Kong –\u0026nbspswaggering, sweaty, bombastic Hong Kong –\u0026nbspis an anywhere kind of place. The friends I made came from erse backgrounds and nations, with friends, ties and cultural touchpoints all over the world. By contrast, I came from a world of single culture: most of my family lives within two hours of each other (except one rogue uncle who lives in Malawi) and my close friends are the ones I’ve had since school. I first went on a plane at the embarrassingly old age of 15 (I don’t think anybody, least of all my Eurocamp-loving parents, thought I would end up flying a lot for work).Expat\u0026nbsplife was like being back at university, but with a lot more cashThe first year in Hong Kong was tough as I clung to my Britishness, my London-ness, like a comfort blanket. In my 350 square foot, two-bed flat in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, I felt not so much fresh off the boat but flung sharply off it. The sights and smells of my new neighbourhood were almost literally intoxicating, and I couldn’t understand why the supermarket opened, begrudgingly, at 8.10am. I never knew where I was going, and I lost all the swagger I had in London about knowing the coolest, newest places to go. I missed my default lazy Sunday afternoon walking along the South Bank, popping into Tate Modern –\u0026nbspin Hong Kong, there didn’t seem to be any museum really worth a repeat visit. (This is a well-known problem –\u0026nbspfor a global city, Hong Kong doesn’t have any world-class institutions, although the recent opening of the Tai Kwun arts complex and the upcoming opening of the M+ visual arts centre is changing that.)In the UK, I fitted in. I knew this retrospectively because I’d never even considered that I hadn’t. It was a natural sort of belonging. My life revolved around the reassuring timestamps of ordinary British life: Strictly Come Dancing,\u0026nbspthe weird April heatwave\u0026nbspand the John Lewis Christmas ad. I still counted down to Christmas based on that the release of that ad.Eighteen months after we moved, Brexit happened.I can still remember the exact moment I found out that the UK had voted to leave the European Union. It was mid-morning in my glassy office block, and colleagues and I had stayed up watching the count. Hong Kong felt very far away from it all, and to be honest Brexit gave us an excuse for a boozy lunch in some drab Belgian-themed pub and the opportunity to use the suffix “exit”\u0026nbspto describe the leaving do of a friend moving away from\u0026nbspthe city.Created with Sketch.In pictures: The coffin homes of Hong Kong Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A general view of residential and commercial buildings in Yau Tsim Mong District which is a popular location for the \u0027subided units\u0027 in Hong KongA five year-old boy plays outside his tiny home, which is made of concrete and corrugated metal on the rooftop of an apartment block as he lives with his parents in an illegal rooftop dwellingA resident walks outside his illegal rooftop dwelling, which is located next to a public housing estate, in the backgroundLi Suet-wen and her son, 6, and daughter, 8, live in a 120-square foot room crammed with a bunk bed, small couch, fridge, washing machine and small table in Hong Kong.

In wealthy Hong Kong, there\u0027s a dark side to a housing boom, with hundreds of thousands of people forced to live in partitioned shoebox apartments, \u0027coffin homes\u0027 and other inadequate housingMy friends and family back home were at the coal face of it. My parents were sending me angry face emojis and announced they were moving to France (two years on they’re still in Essex – their plans to move are about as far along as Theresa May’s). Other friends who’d been up all night sent me bleary-eyed emojis and lightly indignant Whatsapp messages –\u0026nbspwasn’t I glad I lived all those miles away?At that point, the 6,000 mile chasm did feel just that: thousands of miles away. In Hong Kong, a very different type of politics talk was on the agenda for dinner-party conversation –\u0026nbspwould Hong Kong keep its independence or be squashed by China? –\u0026nbspand I sort of hoped Brexit might have collapsed under the weight of expectation by March 2019 anyway.Although in the year after it happened, I was glad to live away from the machinations and non-decisions and dreary refrains of “Brexit means Brexit”. Besides, as sterling fell through the floor, I’d managed to cream off more pounds for my Hong Kong dollars that ever before. I even tentatively posited that if the UK did leave the EU, I might as well set up home in Hong Kong instead.Theresa May’s 2017 speech, in which she derided the anywhere people who felt at home across the world, put into words the crude, untrue split between Leavers or Remainers. It was a defining moment for Brexit, and it was a defining moment for me. At the time, I was an “anywhere”\u0026nbspand couldn’t understand how people like me had become anathema to the national feeling. Most worrying was realising that the UK I ached for was not the UK I would find myself in if I moved back.And how I wanted to move back.\u0026nbspAround the time that May made her “citizen of nowhere” speech, I started to grudgingly accept that I must rather like living in Hong Kong –\u0026nbspafter all, I’d been there for two years. It was probably something to do with the lifestyle, which was hard not to love. Champagne brunches in the winter all-you-can-drink junk boat outings in the summer. Life was just easier: the subway always ran on time and you never woke up to a cold floor in the mornings, even in winter. I made true friends that put up with my constant existential whining about Hong Kong (if you’re reading: I’ll always be truly grateful).Plus, there were the opportunities. Expat life was like being back at university (when was the last time you heard a journalist compare Nottingham with Hong Kong?) but with a lot more cash. The people you met for drinks could introduce you to their entire network, and I met an average of six new people a week (in my six years in London, I think I met six new people in total). Somebody you knew was always doing something entrepreneurial –\u0026nbspthanks to the city being one of the most open places to do business in. Everybody knew everybody, which was comforting, until it started to feel suffocating. I couldn’t escape my job, even though I adored it.Eventually I came to realise that champagne brunches and low tax rates and the indifference I had for Hong Kong weren’t the things I wanted from my life or at least not one full enough for me to accept. The fact I lived 12 flying hours away from family and my closest friends, who were getting married and sprogging with alarming briskness, weighed on me heavily. I had planned my own wedding long-distance and it felt like it was happening to somebody else during much of our 18-month engagement.\u0026nbspIn Hong Kong, I always felt hollow at the fact that I didn’t speak the same language, or share the same culture –\u0026nbspor even the adopted expat one. In Asia, I felt more British and stuck in my ways than ever, which seemed like the opposite of the person I thought I was in Britain.And so the decision to move back wasn’t the proverbial lightning bolt. It was a slow blistering of the feeling that me, living in Hong Kong, wasn’t quite right. I frequently felt angry and upset and weak that I couldn’t settle in this most intoxicating of cities. The longer it went on, the more the issue of Brexit started to feel more and more abstract, and in some ways I was grateful for it happening: weren’t we lucky to live in a place that had at least some autonomy, however blunt, over the way the country was run?And so three and a half years almost to the day after setting foot on Hong Kong Island, I ditched the territory for Gatwick Airport (maybe the most British of all airports –\u0026nbspchaos inside, then surrounded by the gorgeous South Downs outside). I even left without my husband, such was my rush to move back.I’ve been home for around two months now, working for The Independent, where I don’t need to be careful about how I talk about China’s nationality complex: I can now write the words “Taiwan”\u0026nbspand “country”\u0026nbspnext to each other. I’ve realised that democracy means more than just voting for my next leader. It means being able to live in a place where I can speak freely, and be part of a dynamic and shouty media landscape unafraid to say what it thinks.The first night I was back, jet lagged and drunk after a bottle and more of wine, I cried in front of my friends about it being “the end of an era” –\u0026nbspand it is. I’ve transitioned with frightening ease back to my old life: I’m living in the same flat, I have the same friends, and I’ve gone back to eating the same thing for dinner. It’s almost like my three and half years abroad never happened.\u0026nbspThe crude difference is that I’ve reacquainted myself with the UK’s sluggish public services and an increased level of danger –\u0026nbspessentially the spoils that come with an open nation.Tangibly, plenty has changed. In the three and a half years I was away, my London neighbourhood, SE1, has sprouted an outdoor food market, and some hip performance space in what was a car park. The UK has its second female prime minister. I can pay for the Tube using Apple Pay, and everybody uses Uber\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspif they’re not getting on the Night Tube. Half the high street has disappeared and isn’t it great I can pick up my Amazon parcel from a locker?China defends decision to deny work visa for Financial Times editor Bus travel hits 12-year-low as prices rise and services axedWhere do the limits lie for ultra-long-haul air travel?And intangibly, plenty has changed. I feel like a different person. I’ve visited some of the most densely populated cities on earth that aren’t well-known (yet) in the UK. I’ve embedded myself into a culture completely separate from my own and seen how the developing world views the UK. I’ve learned\u0026nbspscraps of Mandarin and known bone-crushing loneliness. I’ve transitioned back to being the well-travelled one among my friends, whereas in Hong Kong I felt like the polar opposite.I can’t say it wasn’t gut-wrenching to leave a life and friends I loved, although the idea of not living in my home country again tore at something even more primal –\u0026nbspBrexit or no Brexit. I’ve at last accepted that I just didn’t like Hong Kong that much, however much I enjoyed the lifestyle.Now, back in London, I have moments of such vibrating happiness to walk along some dingy street in Elephant and Castle I feel I might burst. I wait for a delayed train and my heart feels full (I know, weird).\u0026nbspI’m back in my city, and I’m back on my sofa.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The pound dropped 0.5 per cent to $1.29, the lowest level since early September.Connor Campbell at Spreadex said sterling’s downward trajectory was “unsurprising”. “It appears that the currency has been spooked by Theresa May’s impending meeting with the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, with whom the PM hardly has the best relationship with at the moment (even before the rather violent comments reported in the papers over the weekend).

MPs were quoted as saying she was now entering “the killing zone” and that “assassination is in the air”, while another unnamed Tory was quoted as saying: “The moment is coming when the knife gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted. She’ll be dead soon.” Ms May confirmed on Tuesday that she would meet with the backbench 1922 Committee.David Cheetham, chief market analyst at broker XTB, said: “May’s position is similar to that of the pound in that it seems to be carrying on despite the sizable challenges faced.If May was toppled the pound would see a wave of selling in the short-term since her replacement could increase the chances of a no-deal Brexit, Cheetham added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The companies said the pair-up is expected to be a success because Sainsbury’s and Oasis cater to very similar demographics.

Sainsbury’s director of commercial, James Brown, said: “We are delighted to be welcoming Oasis to Sainsbury’s stores. Its on-trend fashion ranges will complement our high quality Tu clothing offer and support our strategy to make our stores leading fashion destinations.”Hash Ladha, chief executive designate of Oasis, said: “Trialling Oasis in Sainsbury’s is an exciting development for us. This is about presenting the Oasis product proposition and brand experience to Sainsbury’s customers. The customer demographic of both brands is very similar and therefore it is a natural strategic partnership.”This is the latest in a string of deals Sainsbury’s has executed in a bid to ersify its offering and grow its customer base. The retailer has previously agreed partnerships with Clarks and Specsavers. Meanwhile, the group is in the process of buying Asda, which will make it the UK’s biggest retailer, ahead of Tesco, if the deal completes. The companies are waiting for regulatory approval from the competition watchdog, which may require the closure of hundreds of stores before the takeover can go ahead. The CMA has said it will assess whether the merger “could lead to a worse outcome for shoppers through higher prices, a poorer shopping experience, or reductions in the range or quality of products offered”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Today, I want to take the opportunity to apologise to those affected by this practice.”The home secretary said the majority of cases identified had been part of a 2016 operation aimed at addressing fraud.He said\u0026nbspseven cases in this operation were refused on suitability grounds solely for the failure to provide DNA evidence, and a further six were refused partly for that reason.Fifty-one further cases have\u0026nbspbeen identified as part of a 2013 scheme\u0026nbspto allow relatives of Gurkha soldiers to settle in the UK, which wrongly stated that DNA evidence was required, Mr Javid said.A third scheme assessed immigration applications from Afghan nationals working for the UK\u0026nbspgovernment on the basis of mandatory DNA testing. Mr Javid\u0026nbspsaid no one from\u0026nbspthis cohort\u0026nbsphad been refused on these grounds.He said his\u0026nbspdepartment would seek to reimburse any inidual who has suffered financial loss as a result of the errors and was continuing\u0026nbspto closely examine whether any other groups had been affected.Home Office forcing immigrants to take DNA tests against own policyHe also said he was taking action to correct the situation\u0026nbspand had given “clear instructions” that officials should not seek DNA samples. The provision of DNA evidence must be entirely voluntary, he added.Expanding on his apology, Mr Javid\u0026nbspsaid: “It is not fair, and this should not have happened. No one should have faced a demand to provide DNA evidence and no one should have been penalised for not providing it.”It comes after it emerged in July that a\u0026nbspletter had been sent by the Home Office to an applicant’s solicitor stating that it was “imperative” they submit DNA evidence to confirm the paternity of their client’s child, despite the fact that the child already had a British passport.The applicant\u0027s solicitor, Enny Choudhury, of\u0026nbspthe Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said:\u0026nbsp“My client and her child were rendered destitute for 2.5 years as a direct result of the Home Office’s illegal practices.It is clear that countless others will have been subject to the same treatment and it is astonishing that ministers still do not have a grasp on the failings of the Home Office.We agree with the home secretary that there must be a review, but it must be fully independent of him and his Home Office. No one could have faith in its competence to properly investigate its own failings.” \u0026nbspYvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Committee, said: “Coming after\u0026nbspWindrush, this shows something is going very wrong in the Home Office again.\u0026nbsp“A new wider review must be independent and should examine oversight failure and impact of policies on culture of Home Office operations.”Steve Valdez-Symonds, of Amnesty UK, said the\u0026nbspHome Office had “once again been exposed as being a law unto itself”.He added: “The home secretary needs to face up to the fact that problems in his department are systemic, chronic and deep-rooted.\u0026nbsp“Over several decades, successive governments have consistently encouraged policies and practice which disrespect the law and harm the people directly affected.“This dysfunctional department cannot continue to be rewarded by being given more powers while vital safeguards, such as appeal rights and legal aid, are stripped away.\u0026nbsp“Root and branch reform is urgently needed and protections restored to keep the Home Office in check.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We will take responsibility and sort out this mess with a people’s vote.”Speaking to The Independent beforehand, she said many Tory MPs were privately supportive of a second referendum amid bitter isions in the party.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the sheer scale of the event showed that “confidence is growing” in the fight for a fresh vote.To huge cheers, London mayor Sadiq Khan said the march marked a\u0026nbsp“historic moment in our democracy”.Over 700,000 protesters’ call for second Brexit referendumTheresa May told she’s ‘heading for dead end’ in Brexit talksThe collective spreading cheer to Brexit-weary BritsEx-cabinet secretaries condemn Tory Brexiteers for undermining MayFinal Say: Meet some of the people marching a fresh Brexit vote He told protestors: “We’ve heard some complain that a public vote would be undemocratic and unpatriotic. But the opposite is true.“There’s nothing more democratic – nothing more British – than trusting the people to have the final say on our future.”MPs from across the political spectrum addressed the rally, including Green MP Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Labour’s Chuka Umunna and Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who drew huge cheers when she compared\u0026nbspBrexit to a botched operation.Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent,\u0026nbsptold the crowds: “Theresa May says that the Final Say referendum will be a politicians’ vote, not a people’s vote, but we can all remember what some politicians told us in 2016.“We, the people, can all now see what’s really coming. And from where I’m standing it looks like a people’s vote to me.”He revealed that The Independent’s petition for a Final Say had achieved more than 940,000 signatures, adding: “We have to keep on showing up and signing up.”People did show up in their thousands for the march, which was extremely cheerful, except for a handful of Ukip protestors who screamed\u0026nbsp“Losers”\u0026nbspat passers-by from outside Downing Street.An army of students, college pupils and young activists led the march in a sign of the impact of the Brexit vote on the younger generation, some 1.4 million of whom have become eligible to vote since the referendum.Femi Oluwole, from the youth group Our Future Our Choice, told The Independent: “What we are trying to do is bring people together, as nobody has any confidence in what the government is doing.”He said young people were going to be hit hardest by Brexit, both economically and in the opportunities to live and work abroad.Among the crowds was Piero Passet, a 71-year-old restaurant owner from Turin, said he was marching because he was concerned for the future of the younger generation.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

This is my firm belief and this is my understanding of democracy.”Mr Bullmann’s intervention is particularly significant because EU figures have so far been reticent to call for a second vote – for fear they might be seen as interfering in Britain\u0027s\u0026nbsppolitics.But the vast show of support on the streets of the capital has apparently encouraged some in Brussels and Strasbourg to break cover and speak out.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

By-elections are expensive and can be troublesome for the party.I don\u0027t think this government can last for more than a few months, anyway.Asked about his time in parliament, Mr Flynn, 83, said: I\u0027ve loved every minute of it. It\u0027s been a great, wonderful, rich experience.The spectre of nuclear war looms over the UK, with UK and Europe probably the first to be hit, a Labour frontbencher has said.Shadow defence minister Fabian Hamilton spoke days after Donald Trump threatened to pull out of a treaty eliminating some nuclear missiles, due to \u0027Russian non-compliance\u0027.The move makes nuclear war more tangible and real than at any time since the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty was signed in 1987, Mr Hamilton told MPs.Mr Hamilton\u0026nbspsaid Mr Trump\u0027s dangerous threat would unilaterally withdraw the USA from a global system of trust the country had been at the forefront of painstakingly building, leaving European allies exposed.Foreign Office Minister Mark Field said: It is a great worry there does seem to be an erosion of the international rules-based order, something we have relied upon since the Second World War.It\u0027s something that I think all of us recognise needs to adapt and evolve to the world in which we\u0027re living in, but we need to engage with as many partners as possible to ensure that comes to pass.We have longstanding concerns about Russia\u0027s development of a range of new capabilities that actually stand ready to undermine our strategic stability.But Mr Field said the USA was a responsible nuclear power with a policy of reducing the number of nuclear weapons and highlighted the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start) signed by Russia and the US in 2011.Sajid Javid\u0026nbsphas apologised after immigrants were forced to take DNA tests in order to settle their UK status, as part of a ministerial statement on the issue in the Commons.\u0026nbspHe said: Let me clear - across our immigration system, no one should have faced a demand to supply DNA evidence and no one should have been penalised for not providing it.\u0026nbspIn particular, I would like to extend my apology to those Gurkhas and Afghans who have been affected.\u0026nbspHere is a previous story we wrote on the issue:\u0026nbspTom Watson, shadow culture secretary, said:\u0026nbsp“Facebook deserve every penny of this fine, and more.

Understanding the ‘clans’ offers valuable insights into who might want what from Brexit and how this might affect future elections, or indeed referendum outcomes.”Between the 2015 and 2017 election both Labour and the Tories increased their share in many of the groups, squeezing out smaller parties.Created with Sketch.How big are the UK\u0027s voter clans and how do they vote?

Instead, he said, he had argued that claims by the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspthe party\u0027s costings contained factual mistakes were irrelevant.He wrote on Twitter: Apparently the prime minister quoted me saying about Labour\u0027s 2017 manifesto \u0027the numbers did not add up\u0027. In fact I said \u0027let us suppose the IFS was correct\u0027 and examined consequences. I have never taken a view on whether they diddidn\u0027t add up. If that is what she said, she lied.In a blog post titled The day Theresa May lied in parliament about something I wrote, he continued: The point I wanted to stress was that it didn’t matter if the IFS were right that the numbers didn’t add up, because the fiscal stance was good for the economy, and could well satisfy Labour\u0027s very good Fiscal Credibility Rule.Of the prime minister\u0027s comments, he said: Was this an unfortunate case of misreading? It seems extremely implausible. I’m certain that when the PM or more probably some adviser misquotes someone in a draft PMQ response, someone - possibly even the person themselves - checks that the quote is correct. You have to have serious comprehension difficulties to misunderstand the meaning of \u0027let us suppose\u0027.He suggested Ms May\u0027s claim was a deliberate\u0026nbsplie told to gain political effect but said he would be\u0026nbspwilling to accept it was an honest mistake if the prime minister\u0026nbspor someone from her team could explain how it happened.\u0026nbspHe said: In the scheme of things the issue is very minor, but the prime minister\u0026nbsplying whatever the context should be important.

So is Hammond’s next door.Whoever takes over — Boris, David Davis or Jeremy Hunt — needs an emergency clear-out.The big guns of the Treasury need to be pointed at the “enemy” not its own side.After two long, wasted years, Britain is engaged in an unexpectedly desperate fight, not just to salvage Brexit but to save British democracy.Weekend crowds demanding a second referendum seem oblivious to the threat such a crazy re-run would pose to this nation’s centuries-old stability, ironically the envy of Europe.We cannot reverse the  referendum without turning Brexit into a perpetual running sore. And Britain can never rejoin the EU except on its knees.The only way to put this corrosive issue to bed is for Brexit to succeed — as it will, despite treacherous Tony Blair and Facebook hypocrite Nick Clegg.To succeed as we must we need a new chancellor as well as a new prime minister.Diehard Remainer Phil Hammond should be first out the door.It was Spreadsheet Phil who vetoed vital preparations for No Deal — now a better-than - prospect with time rapidly running out.And it was Hammond who surrendered the one negotiating weapon Brussels fears most — a thriving, low-tax Britain competing with the EU on its doorstep.Our economic fate is entirely in our hands. We can make taxes and tarfs as competitive as we like.Better investment incentives and lower corporation tax rates would trigger a flood of foreign investment in UK plc — and ensure car makers like Nissan and Toyota never leave our shores.Yet the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has ruled them out.“Phil is like those Harry Potter Dementor creatures,” says a top Tory. “He sucks the le out of any room he happens to be in.”Hammond is easily replaced. Michael Gove, an ex-future PM but a formidable Cabinet minister, has the drive and imagination to take on the Treasury “Blob”.There is no shortage of Brexit talent on the Tory benches.Just compare thundering Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC with prissy dried-stick predecessor Dominic Grieve.Grieve is busy sabotaging Brexit. Cox finds ways to make it work.He is now “marking Number Ten’s homework” on Mrs May’s wretched Northern Ireland “backstop”.Some even tip him as a dark horse in the leadership stakes.There is one other big change needed at the heart of Britain’s Brexit team.Our next PM must have a new EU negotiator.Nobody could be worse than Olly Robbins, already reportedly eyeing up a £m-a-year golden parachute into a top City job.Lelong Europhile Robbins has led Mrs May into so many disastrous EU traps — especially her humiliation in Salzburg — he is often cast as an EU “double agent”.It was Robbins who told EU negotiator Michel Barnier that Britain might stay indefinitely in “transition” while the fantasy Northern Ireland backstop was sorted out.And pay £bn more on top of the £bn ransom for the privilege.The idea that Robbins is the “EU’s man in Whitehall” is not such a stretch when you consider his Jeremy Corbyn-style applause for Communist Russia.Kremlin leaders, he told fellow Oxford students in , “changed Russia from a backward peasant autocracy, despised by the West, into a technological giant at whom the world cowered in fear for half a century.”Everyone is entitled to youthful naivety.But can anyone imagine Olly Robbins fighting our corner for EU democracy and accountability, let alone the referendum verdict of .m Brexit-voting Brits SAUDI Arabia’s rulers must be really annoyed with dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.This elderly trouble maker walked alone into his country’s Turkish consulate knowing he might never emerge alive.He was clearly looking for trouble.Once inside, using his bare hands, he attacked a gang of  innocent Saudi torturers who had just flown in for a couple of hours’ holiday armed only with a bone saw and a hypodermic syringe.Then, to the embarrassment of kindly Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he went and hid his own body.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I didn’t reply at the time but I’m going to give Sun readers the answer now – and it’s very simple.None of this is about me. It’s all about you.That’s why, when I’m confronted with tough choices during the Brexit negotiations, I don’t think about what the implications are for me. Instead, I ask myself what it means for you, for your family and for the whole of the United Kingdom.Am I bringing back control of your money, your borders and your laws Am I protecting your jobs and making sure nothing gets in the way of our brilliant entrepreneurs and small businesses Am I protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom And, above all, am I delivering the Brexit that the people of this country so clearly voted for I need to be able to answer “Yes” to every one of these questions.Andthat means there are some dficult days in Brussels, well that’s just something I have to deal with.Because the Brexit talks are not about me or my personal fortunes. They’re about the national interest – and that means making the right choices, not the easy ones.Inevitably, that will take time. Brexit is the UK’s biggest constitutional change for generations. Unpicking more than  years of treaties, agreements and laws would be a challenge under any circumstances and, as no country has ever left the EU before, it’s not asthere’s an instruction manual for those either side of the negotiating table to follow.I know it can seem like the talks are never-ending, and that many of you have been frustrated by the endless back and forth on technical points – I certainly feel that way sometimes too.But with five months to go until we leave the EU, we have already reached agreement on the vast majority of our exit deal.What became clear at last week’s meeting in Brussels is that the very last stages of the talks are going to be the hardest of all.This includes dealing with the so-called “backstop”: making sure that, no matter what our new relationship with Europe looks like, there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.I’ve been very clear that this must be achieved without creating any kind of border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK – doing so would undermine our precious Union and put at risk the hard-won peace.So I am working closely with my counterparts in Europe to explore every possible solution to the border issue.Does that mean I think this negotiation will get tougher before we reach our goal  YesDo I have some long and dficult days ahead  I’m sure I do.But what I’m thinking about is not how hard it all is today.I’m thinking about the prize that lies before us tomorrow about the great opportunities the Government will help open up for you once we clear the last few hurdles.As we enter the final, crucial phase of the talks there will undoubtedly be some unexpected challenges to which we must rise.But the finish line is in sight. And I am more determined than ever that we will get there together, with a Brexit deal that’s right for you, right for your family and right for our country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Smoking tobacco is bad news.But vaping is dferent.You heat up a solution called an e-liquid, which typically contains nicotine, a propellant called propylene glycol and or vegetable glycerin and flavourings.What you don’t do is burn tobacco or produce tar or carbon monoxide — two of the most harmful elements of all in tobacco smoke.Sure, some vapes may contain a fraction of some of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke, but they are present at much lower levels,detectable at all.So are they safe  According to all the international medically-reviewed evidence from such expert organisations as Public Health England, the Royal Colleges of Physicians and General Practitioners, the British Medical Association and Cancer Research UK, e-cigarettes are at least  per cent safer than traditional cigarettes.The American Cancer Society and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine both agree with them.Yes, the nicotine, of course, is addictive. But so what  So is caffeine, even eating.Contrary to popular belief, nicotine does not give you cancer and it is relatively harmless generally.Apparently only  per cent of the population know this.Happily, there is no evidence of harm to other people from vaping and,used instead of nicotine replacement gum or patches, may even help expectant mums remain smoke-free in the long term.As a doctor I don’t want any young person or non-nicotine user to try vaping. Ever. Period.As it happens, regular use of e-cigs among “never” smokers is still very rare at just . per cent.But look at what they’ve done to help tobacco smokers quit.In the UK, .million vapers have quit smoking completely and more than , have given up both smoking and vaping.In fact, this is Britain’s most popular method of quitting with two-thirds stopping successfully when used alongside professional stop-smoking NHS support.In this country we have some of the strictest regulations in the world.E-cigs are subject to minimum standards of quality and safety as well as clear packaging and labelling requirements.All ingredients have to be notied, advertising is prohibited in media such as television, newspapers and magazines, it is illegal to sell them to under s and to adults intending to pass them on to under s.That is responsible regulation whichever way you look at it.This month’s national Stoptober campaign recommends using e- cigarettes as a stop-smoking aid andit helps some of the million smokers in the UK kick the habit for good then perhaps doctors like me will see fewer people in our surgeries struggling to breath or devastated by a cancer diagnosis.AndI see any ex-smoking patients of mine having a quiet vape outside my surgery door, I shall give them a heartfelt pat on the back and cherish the fact that there will be one less nasty fag end polluting the street.NICOTINE contained in e-liquids is a highly addictive substance that raises blood pressure and spikes your adrenalin, increasing the chances of having a heart attack.This is particularly worrying as we see a number of iniduals who are constantly vaping, especially as it is seen as more convenient and cost-effective than lighting up a cigarette, as well as being considered more socially acceptable to vape indoors.While vaping appears to be safer than cigarettes, the truth is that it hasn’t been around long enough for us to know the potential damage it can cause to our health.The long-term effects of the chemicals contained in e-liquids haven’t been examined.However, I have looked into ious research that has been carried out on certain e-liquids that were found to contain substances that can cause damage to the immune system and are linked to other health conditions such as cancer.Vaping isn’t great for your oral health either.It’s common for vaping to cause a dry mouth, and I’ve met a number of iniduals who have developed oral thrush, most likely caused by vaping.Although nicotine does not have a colour, it becomes yellow when combined with oxygen which could lead to tooth discolouration.As nicotine is a vasocon-strictor, it limits blood flow in oral tissue, which can cause gum disease and bad breath.As time goes on, I am reading new research which proves vaping has a negative effect on health.To what extent, only time will tell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why do they not get paid what they are worth to their company, and why are so many overlooked for promotion The sad fact is that for every £ men earn, women make just  pence.Just over one in ten women negotiated their starting salary, while more than half of all men haggle with their boss before they have even started work.When women do ask for more pay, they are  per cent less likely to get a raise. Andthey do receive a wage increase it will be  per cent less than men get.Sadly, it is common in business that women are often viewed as weak or unable to cope. And once we think about or start a family, we become toxic to employers.I receive hundreds of direct messages on social media from women asking: “How do I get a pay rise  How do I get noticed at work  How can I get promoted  How can I get on after maternity leave ”So now I am launching Get What You Want, a series of online masterclasses and podcasts covering everything from getting promoted to dealing with the word no, overcoming challenges, negotiating pay, writing a fantastic CV and nailing an interview.It will also cover baby-proofing careers, as well as becoming a super-mum after maternity leave.A lot of women have skills but just lack confidence. As women, we don’t shout about our wins enough for fear we will appear arrogant, even though men talk about them all the time.Here are some of my tips to winning at work.When people say: “I hate my job” I always ask: “Why are you telling me  I can’t do anything about it.”YOU have to do something. Sit down and work out what it is you don’t like about the position and set yourself a task of getting a new one.Be very dedicated and very professional and excel when you get to the interview.Many people don’t realise that when you are invited for an interview it is because they believe you can do the job.The secret is convincing them that you can do the job better than anyone .You should be able to talk about your specialist subject, which is yourself.People find it very dficult to list all the things they have done really well in a professional way to show good examples of why they can do the job.Opening a negotiation is all about knowing your worth.And knowing your value is really about your self-worth. They are totally linked.Write down all the things where you have made a big ­contribution, all the things that you have changed and made a dference, how you have added value. Put together testimonials to really back up what you have done.Then work out what more you want to do, because going above and beyond your job description is very important.Take out all the emotion, go in and lay out for your boss the facts of what you’ve contributed to the organisation.Sometimes people can be very passive. They say: “I’ll go along with what everyone  agrees with.”They want to avoid conflict. They don’t really think their opinion is as important as other people’s, so they are simply giving others a licence to ignore them.Learn to say no. Say: “I don’t really have the time butI can make the time I can do it for you.” Otherwise you become like a human sponge. Don’t let them take advantage.Employers take advantage of women’s lack of confidence, especially a mother ing from maternity leave. Many feel so grateful to have a job that they tend to put up with almost anything.Eleven per cent of new mothers report that they have been dismissed or made redundant where others in their workplace were not, or were treated so poorly they felt they had to leave.That means as many as , women are losing their jobs each year.Have a really clear plan of how you will manage at home and manage work.

Ms Knightley, who adds, “Rescue yourself,” clearly feels she is protecting daughter Edie by banning something that doesn’t concur with her own off-the-shelf, Poundland version of what feminism should be.But what she’s in danger of doing is wilfully nurturing a potential “snowflake” who, rather than develop the critical thinking skills that allow healthy debate, will simply stick their fingers in their ears and cry foul when they see or hear something that dfers from their own world view.Keira, tonight’s homework is to really readCinderella and analyse it.Look past the Disney-esque cute rodents, pretty frocks and glass slippers and instead dig a little deeper to ­appreciate the original’s narrative of how hope can turn unjust oppression into ­triumphant reward.Cinderella is a young woman who has not only suffered the loss of her loving father, but now faces a letime of abuse from an uncaring stepmother and her equally unpleasant daughters.But instead of sitting in the ashes ­waiting unquestioningly for whatever fate might have in store for her, she remains resolutely ­optimistic and decides to secretly defy her nemesis by gatecrashing a hot-ticket party to which she hasn’t been invited.Now that’s girl power.Ultimately, she “‘rescues” herself by proactively going to the ball where, instead of abuse, she experiences the redemptive qualities of love and kindness.They just happen to come in the form of a handsome prince.In the same week, Kristen Bell — who coincidentally voices Anna in the Disney film Frozen — found herself caught up in the slipstream of Keira’s PC virtue signalling after reportedly saying that Snow White gives young girls the wrong ­message about consent “because you cannot kiss someonethey’re sleeping”.Except Kristen’s comment was taken out of context and she’s got the balance right.Because what she actually said was that she reads the story with her two ­daughters, aged five and three, then asks them: “Don’t you think it’s weird that Snow White didn’t ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple ” before starting up a conversation about the dos and don’ts of taking food from strangers.Or, “Don’t you think that it’s weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission ” to float an almost subliminal, age-appropriate understanding of what does and doesn’t constitute ­consent.Kristen isn’t banning tales of old, she’s using them to stimulate discussions.In other words, teaching her children the vital le skills of critical thinking — dictionary definition: “the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment” — and being able to rationally debate that judgment with someone whose view might dfer from your own.Attempting to sanitise a child’s world by airbrushing history will hinder, not help them.Instead, wield history’s lessons as a tool to educate.Cinderella was of its time and now the Disney pendulum has seemingly swung the other way to depict a world where all the central characters are feisty, opinionated young women who power-kick their way through le.But how will Keira’s daughter know how far the depiction of Disney ­princesses has comeshe’s not allowed to see where they’ve been ONE morning last week, I spent a glorious couple of hours walking around Westminster Abbey.Buried or commemorated there are, among others, more than , great Britonsincluding Sir Isaac Newton, Jane Austen, Noel Coward, Charles Darwin, the Bronte sisters, Clement Attlee, Charles Dickens, David Livingstone, Stephen Hawking and, of course, the grave of the unknown warrior, buried on November ,  “in honour of the many multitudes who during the Great War of - gave the most that man can give . . . le itself.”My mother works at the Abbey as a “blue-gowner” – the volunteer guides there to answer any questions not covered by the electronic headsets – and, while showing us the ft by ft grave of poet Ben Jonson, who is the only person there to be buried upright, she was approached by a couple of earnest-looking women in their early twenties.Amid such a rich seam of history, rigorous intellect and achievement, what did they ask “Excuse me, where did David Beckham sit for the royal wedding ”THE number of stay-at-home dads has dropped to the lowest level in five years.Experts reckon it could be due to men “growing tired” of the tough job of raising kids.Proof,needed, might be the glassy-eyed expression of Bond actor Daniel Craig,  just six weeks after we Rachel Weisz gave birth to their daughter.He never looks this knackered when he’s jumping off buildings and dodging bullets.Stay-at-home parenthood can be isolating, sometimes dull, frequently thankless and relentlessly bloody exhausting. Only the strong survive it.THANKS to Ryanair’s ­astonishing failure to act when a passenger racially abused Windrush immigrant Delsie Gayle on one of its flights, the man will likely escape prosecution because of jurisdictional issues once a plane takes off from one country’s airspace to another.Instead, he is likely only to be banned from ever travelling on Ryanair again.Which, as plenty of the budget airline’s past ­customers might tell you, could equally be regarded as a blessing rather than a punishment.COMEDIAN Seann Walsh and his Strictly partner Katya Jones have survived the dreaded dance-off to, presumably, jive another day.Because, let’s face it, since that snog, the Strictly bosses are ­rapidly running out of drearily chaste dances to give them.Last weekend it was the unsexy Charleston, ­performed in equally unsexy “Where’s Wally” outfits that virtually screamed “nothing to see here”. Then this weekend it was a faintly ­ludicrous, undeniably platonic quickstep that saw them trotting around the floor like a couple of hyperactive show ponies.Assuming the sizzling Argentine tango is, er, strictly no-go, whatever next  A jive in burkas  A Viennese waltz in sackcloths Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Everybody was saying we need unity.”The PM spelled out to the room why she was pursuing a softer Brexit vision, warning that the referendum decision to leave the EU could have “consequences”.One MP told The Sun: “She said that we will be able to look voters in the eye and say we have honoured our commitment to uphold the referendum.“But she also said it’s the job of government to make sure that whatever Brexit we end up with, we will protect the economy from the cosequences.”Home Secretary Sajid Javid told The Sun that it was a “solid performance” that “will put to bed once and for all that she is the person to lead us”.But other Tory MPs branded the meeting “totally stage managed” with Whips planted to bang on the doors to make the applause from inside seem louder.One Leave-backing MP told The Sun that Mrs May’s pitch “wasn’t great”, adding: “She hasn’t won me over”.Some of the PM’s biggest critics, including former Tory leader IDS, stayed away altogether.Another senior Brexiteer backbencher said: “It was your standard  meeting, tightly controlled and designed for one thing - to give the leader a good show”.Most of the questions aimed at the PM were supportive, with MPs urging loyalty.But Brexit backer Andrew Bridgen tackled Mrs May directly on her handling of the negotiations on what concessions she had won from Brussels.As the PM began to reel off what she saw as wins on Citizens Rights, the ECJ and the transition period, MPs broke into applause in a bid to shore her up against her fiercest critics.Brexiteer Nadine Dorries also repeated her call for a change of leader after leaving the room.More Cabinet isions emerged yesterday when it emerged that Energy minister Claire Perry had made a thinly veiled dig at Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt for taking a position on Brexit just to further his leadership hopes.Ms Perry’s attack came during a meeting of the PM’s top table in No on Tuesday.Last night Theresa May was urged to back a FIVE-DAY debate on her final Brexit deal – where MPs would have the ability to consider alternatives before voting on the PM’s agreement.Former Tory Attorney General Dominic Grieve said this would allow MPs to see the scale of Commons support for other options such as a Norway-style deal before the crunch vote.Trying to avoid debate on alternatives would “be both wrong, and,I may add, I think it would be a very big mistake”.Today Environment Secretary Michael Gove will introduce the Fisheries Bill in Parliament – promising Britain is on the way to “taking back control of our waters”.The legislation will end the automatic right of EU vessels to fish in UK waters and proposing powers to ensure the UK can set its own fishing quotas.An Ipsos MORI poll yesterday revealed growing pessimism amongst the British public on Mrs May’s chances of getting a good deal.We are wary of it lasting a day beyond . Dragging us into another EU budget cycle wouldn’t just mean chipping in another few billion for bureaucrats to squander — it also risks the UK being roped in to the whole six-year cycle.If the PM has any hope of getting a deal through Parliament, the transition must have a legally-binding end date.Anything less would be the definition of a bad deal — and no deal is better than a bad deal.Three-quarters now say they lack confidence in her - %, up from % last month.A former Cabinet Minister declared Theresa May could be gone within a YEAR.Europhile Tory Nicky Morgan said she was absolutely behind the PM - for now.But she told ITVs Peston: I do think we will probably, in the course of the next  months, we will be looking for a new leader.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Legal process and smart performers in the drama of a trial will catch them out. But Bert Hannam, in his long career, would match any barrister, and survive cross-examination with a flair and panache that won him admirers, but also made some enemies. It was March,  in Number One court at the Old Bailey and the man in the dock was a family doctor, being tried for murder. The previous year was free of hangings, as the pressure for reform and for abolition of the death penalty was gaining momentum, but now here was John Bodkin Adams , long-serving doctor in Eastbourne, being potentially the first person hanged after the year when the public executioner was rested from his duties.The police officer charged with the task of gathering evidence against Adams was one of the Yard’s top detectives, Bert Hannam. The sleuth and his team were faced with the task of crossing swords with a brilliant defence barrister, Geoffrey Lawrence, and Lawrence has fastened on one meeting of Hannam with Adams which was, as the detective stated, a ‘chance meeting’ at which searching questions had been asked.  Lawrence had already made the medical experts called by the prosecution look hopelessly inept, and Bart knew he was in for a tough time. He was cool, controlled and ready with factual details which explained away the chance meeting as nothing sinister or threatening to the doctor.Hannam, ‘The Count of Scotland Yard’ came through and held his own with a brilliant legal brain. The Yard had had learned this the hard way. Starting as a young copper in the late twenties, he worked his way through the ranks during the war and proved his mettle in cases of theft, fraud and corruption. He was not noticed by the press though, until the notorious Teddington Towpath murders in the summer of  when the world could talk of nothing  but the coronation and the royal family. Alfred Whiteway had raped and killed two young women on the towpath, and Hannam found himself leading a murder investigation, after playing second fiddle to other men, gather valuable experience and acquiring the confidence and the professional skills involved in dealing with serious crime. He got his man, but again, his main obstacle was a courtroom tussle, brought out when it was known that a constable had taken away the murder weapon in the police car, back to his home. Bert Hannam, by the time he faced the formidable Geoffrey Lawrence, was the man the Yard brought in to sort things out. In the Towpath murder trial there was an allegation from Whiteway that his confession had been forced from him.Hannam, the defence lawyer put it to Hannam that the confession was ‘completely manufactured’ and Hannam, unflustered and calm, said simply but with authority, ‘That is absolutely untrue.’ ‘The Count’ was a man with charisma.  He was meticulously concerned with his appearance, his manner and his confidence as a man who would inspire confidence and trust. When he went north to lead the investigation into the brutal murder of an aged shop-keeper in Halax, Emily Pye, the local paper was impressed and their account of him makes clear the power of the man’s presence, And in an interview with a reporter we have a brief instance of his matter-of –fact efficiency: The Scotland Yard chief... made a special appeal to Halax people for information about anyone who was not at home between  noon and three p.m. on Saturday. I know this sounds like an enormous task but I would like to see them all the same. This was a most terrible crime. The woman was really brutally attacked. Bert Hannam was a man who cultivated the habit of having men working with him who could be trusted to absorb and apply his methods, and these were always carefully planned and discussed. He had learned from the best, and he had been compelled to conduct investigations in wartime, in the heart of the Blitz, where he made many friends working in the criminal justice system, including the brilliant Molly Lefebure, assistant to Dr Keith Simpson, the Home Office pathologist. He was not the most forthcoming person when faced with the curiosity of the media, and his arch-enemy was Percy Hoskins, chief crime reporter of The Express. Percy took against the extreme thoroughness of Bert’s gathering of evidence of Adams the higher echelons of the judiciary and leaders of the government were faced with the potential hanging of a family doctor and Hoskins began to see Bert’s determined and prolonged search for evidence as a witch-hunt against a man who was easing the passing of people near death.  One way or another, the victory in court, keeping Adams out of the death cell and from the end of a rope, had to happen. In an age when detectives were glamorous and beginning to appear on radio and television dramas, Bert Hannam merely got on with the job in hand and never succumbed to the vain courting of celebrity.He had that most valuable of detective capabilities: discretion. What is not widely known about the man is his participation in currency regulation investigation in the immediate post-war years. He was not merely an officer linked to murder cases far from it in fact, because he always acquired what we would now call a wide portfolio of expertise on his c.v. He learned fast and he understood that he was working at a time when police corruption was in the air as well as in the news. Even the fact that took part in enquiries regarding this corruption could have given him a tainted image. But he kept to professional actions and attitudes and pressed on with duties regardless of criticisms. In the s, when Britain was still slowly and painfully recovering from the deprivations and sufferings of the war, the police were gradually reformed and reorganised. New strategies of police training came along, to replace the Trenchard measures of the pre-war years, Bert Hannam became something of a consultant and mentor, and his son was to later become the man who ran the new college. The Hannam name was firmly placed in recent police history.

Isabella had been sleeping with me, and I must have gotten up and gone downstairs for a drink. She must have noticed I wasnt there and followed me down and found me on the floor. Clare Cattermole, the medical emergency dispatcher who took Isabellas call in August, described the schoolgirl as amazing. It was the first time Clare had ever taken a call from a young child, but she added that Isabella answered her questions better than most adults. She said: You dont expect to hear a young persons voice on the phone.  Ive had a few child callers before, but a parent will always take over the call. But when Isabella told me her mummy wasnt awake, I knew that wasnt going to happen this time. There are certain questions that we have to ask, and you have to make sure you bring them down to her age so she can follow. She engaged really well, she was amazing and is a real credit to her mum. She answered every question, better than most adults to be honest. Clare, based at the North West Ambulance Services Liverpool call centre, explained that sometimes when a call comes through it can give you an idea of where the caller is. But this wasnt the case with Chas phone, and Clare had no information as to where Isabella was. Had the little girl not known her address - which Cha says is down to a family joke they have with her auntie - then it could have taken a long time to trace the call and send help. She added: Its so important that kids know this information.  After I spoke to Isabella, I thought - would my kids have been able to do that  So when I got home I told them what to do so they would know what to do in an emergency. Isabella, who is in reception at East Crompton St James Primary School in Shaw, and Cha were reunited with Clare at NWAS Manchester call centre on Wednesday. They were given a tour before Isabella was presented with an Infant Le Saver award for her heroic actions. Cha, who works for GTD , says she had never had a conversation with her daughter about what to do in an emergency, but says she loves watching ambulance programmes and believes she must have picked it up from there, or by listening to her talking about her work. Im so proud of her, she added. I just dont think she realises how big what she did was.

Lee Jensen, , also installed a tracking device on girlfriend Danielle Amess mobile phone in his jealous bid to know where she was at all hours of the day. Jensen, from Grimsby, went on to send abusive text messages to Danielles manager accusing him of showing an interest in her.He was convicted of coercive and controlling behaviour at Grimsby Crown Court where he received a -month suspended sentence, reports Grimsby Live .Judge Simon Jack said: It must have been very degrading and distressing for her to be treated that way. You have recognised that what you have done was wrong by your guilty pleas.  Prosecuting Jeremy Evans said Danielle had known Jensen for around  months and an intimate relationship started around November last year. He said he lived at his home near Peoples Park in Grimsby and she lived at her home in the town. Mr Evans said: She describes how he behaved loving and gentlemanly towards her to begin with but then he began to accuse her of infidelity. She could not tolerate that and broke off the relationship. It resumed in February of this year but very quickly that behaviour began to deteriorate and spiral out of control. It had been a relationship that was working and she felt supported. But then he obtained the passwords to heraccounts and he was tracking her using her mobile phone. The court heard she obtained employment but had to stop work after a number of weeks after Jensen sent abusive text messages to her manager accusing him of showing an interest in her.  He wanted to know where she was at all hours of the day and constantly accused her of infidelity, said Mr Evans. He added: When she attempted to leave both homes, he would prevent her. The prosecutor said bugging devices were concealed under cushions in her bedroom by Jensen, so he could listen to her. He subjected her to body checks. He prevented her from visiting her own GP. After the relationship ended he made futile threats to burn her house down. Danielle sought accommodation at a Womens Refuge. But Jensen found out where it was an was seen repeatedly driving past it. Reading her Victim Impact Statement, Mr Evans said: She feels her le has been taken away from her. She has lost her independence, lost her employment and had her children taken from her. Because she lost her job she has not been able to pay rent and has had to move. He added: She said It is almost like he is an addiction that I cannot live without him. i am not the person I once was. i feel isolated and a shadow of my former self. He said he repeatedly called her a tramp and sometimes spat at her. For Jensen, Nigel Sloane said since his arrest in August he has been in prison on remand.  He said: It has given him time to reflect on what he has done and he tells me it has given him time to sort his head out.He added there was no contact with the complainant and there were no previous convictions against his client. Mr Sloane said his client suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from his service in the military both with the Army and Royal Navy. It does not give a reasonbut it is a factor. Judge Jack said Jensens stress disorder following his military service may have been a contributory factor in his paranoia. He ordered Jensen to undergo a rehabilitation requirement over  days and take part in a building better relationships programme. A restraining order not to contact Danielle was imposed for two years. A curfew from pm to am is in place for the next three months.

They announced the baby is due in spring  but, as people have pointed out, thats a pretty long season. Speculation of the month of the royal babys birth may be over after royal watchers spotted what they think is a clue on Meghans hand.  The Duchess, , was supporting husband Prince Harry at an Invictus Games event in Australia earlier this week, looking elegant in a white jacket over her black shirt. As ever, she wore beautul jewellery to finish off the look - and eyes were drawn towards the rings on her right hand. Meghan wore three stacked rings, each with a gemstone, which have led to people speculating it had a special meaning to do with the babys birth.  As Meghans birthday is in August and Harrys is in September, some thought the green and blue gems at the top and bottom of the stack were their birthstones of green peridot and blue sapphire. The gem sandwiched in the middle band looks to be diamond, which is the birthstone of the month of April. The rings are from Ecksand, a Canadian jewellery designer Meghan has worn at other events, and each ring is sold separately so the customer can pick and choose whatever gemstone they want - and stack them whatever way they want.On the jewellers website, the ring with a round emerald stone is on sale for , while the marquise cut sapphire and diamond rings are available for  and  respectively.One fan took to Twitter , under the name @DuchyofSuccess, saying: Imhoping Meghans stacked rings represent their birthstones and Baby Sussex is an April baby.Meghans birthstone-green peridot. Baby Sussex birthstone - diamond. Harrys birthstone - blue sapphire. Could Megans rings be a nice little way to mark their babys arrival next year  Its possible as they have been chosen out of any number of gemstones. But its equally likely she wore the rings because she liked them - or because her stylist picked them out for her. Even so, it hasnt stopped people rushing to place bets on an April arrival of Baby Sussex today. Bookmakers have even slashed the odds of Harry and Meghans baby being born in April, following a string of bets since this morning.

He told the Manchester Evening News: I saw something in the distance rolling. I didnt realise what it was until I got a bit closer. Then I realised it was the pram that rolled onto the main road.  Then I saw the lady run out of the shop. She ran to the pram with her mouth open, like Oh my god, and then got the pram off the road. If Id have stopped I would have given her a piece of my mind. The incident was caught on camera at about .pm on Tuesday, October . I thought Oh my god, I slowed down and saw her pull the pram back off the road. She was shocked - I dont know why she left her pram outside while she was in the shop, because by the looks of that pram, it looks like a newborn baby. Its not a toddler, its more than likely going to be a newborn baby.  Martin was worried anything could have happened. He said: I was pretty angry over the fact she has left her baby outside a shop while she has gone in the shop. I think she just needs to be a bit more safe.

When a friend arrived at the mums house in Camelford, Cornwall, the following morning, she found the little girl laying on the sofa in just a nappy - unable to stand or focus before being violently sick. Following a delay in calling for an ambulance, South West Ambulance Trust paramedic Peter Rabson arrived at the scene and drove the mum and child to hospital. He described how the mum smoked cannabis in the house while he treated the toddler before sleeping most of the way to hospital, reports Cornwall Live. Speaking about the scene in the house when he arrived, Mr Rabson told Truro Crown Court he found the mum sitting on a mattress with the girl in her arms. Heavily pregnant womans nightmare night as husband suffers heart attack hours before shes due to give birthMr Rabson said of the baby: “She was drowsy but when she was spoken to and engaged with she became more alert. When I took my gaze away from her she would become glazed over and her legs couldn’t handle her weight when she stood up.” Mr Rabson explained that he spoke to an out-of-hours doctor who was suitably concerned, telling him it was “asshe’d been intoxicated with something”. Mr Rabson said: “The out-of-hours service had no clinical appointments available and the doctor was concerned so the decision was taken that I’d take her to hospital. “I had to drive tomum’s house to collect a car seat. She got out and went into the property and left the child with me, which was slightly unusual. “She came across quite unphased. After about five minutes she came back and got into the car. There was a strong smell of cannabis on her that I couldn’t smell before.” When asked about the journey to the Royal Cornwall Hospital, Mr Rabson said “we travelled for about a mile out of Camelford and then sheslept all the way to hospital”. Cot designer pleads GUILTY after baby boy chokes to death on bespoke pound bedMr Rabson also confirmed that at the time he had asked the defendantthere was a chance the child could have been exposed to any substances to which she replied no. Describing events leading up to the toddler falling ill, prosecuting barrister Philip Lee said: “In October  the defendant lived as a single parent in a terraced house. “On Friday October  the defendant left her daughter in the care of a friend and went to Plymouth to earn money as a female escort. “Later that night the defendant spoke with a friend and, as a result, went to Torquay and joined her friend there in a hotel room with her friend’s ex-partner and another man. She told police that she continued drinking at the hotel and that there were drugs there including cocaine but she didn’t take any of the cocaine.” Mr Lee outlined how the young victim had been handed over to the care of another friend before the defendant arrived back in Camelford just after midday and collected her. Mr Lee added: “Back at the defendant’s house one of the two men from Torquay was there. Toby Gill told the defendant’s friend he had been using crack in the house and during an argument the defendant told her friend she had smoked a little crack.  “The child was in the bedroom and when the friend went home she exchanged texts with the defendant. “The following morningthe friend ed to the defendant’s home. She text her and received no response then on arrival knocked on the door to which there was no answer. She looked through the letterbox and saw the child lying on the sofa only in a nappy. “She called her to sit up and then the defendant came downstairs and opened the door. It became apparent the child was unwell and her legs buckled and she was unable to stand. The defendant was upset and saying sorry. “The friend told her not to call the ambulance and that she would take her to hospital herself. Soon after the child was violently sick.” He said: “It was apparent the defendant was in a weakened and distraught state of mind and it is alleged that while the paramedic was there she began to smoke cannabis.  “He could smell a strong waft of cannabis when she got into the vehicle and then the defendant then fell asleep on the way to hospital. At the hospital she was unsteady on her feet and had slurred speech.” The Crown Prosecution Service claims that the child’s condition gradually improved before she was discharged on October  but a urine test showed the presence of valium-like drugs and cocaine. The defendant denied two charges of cruelty to a person under , firstly by exposing her in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering and another cruelty charge relating to the failure to provide her with adequate medical aid. After less than three hours of deliberation the jury found her not guilty of one charge, clearing the defendant of being responsible for the administration of the drugs, but convicted her of the second, neglect by failing to provide her child with adequate medical aid. The victim now lives with the defendants mother.

Summers blistering heatwave is now a distant memory as temperatures begin to slide well below freezing. They could plunge to -C in parts of Scotland and just below freezing where, while forecasters say up to cm of snow could fall on higher ground. Ice could pose a danger on the roads and there is likely to be a widespread frost.  Things will begin to take a turn for the worse when a blast of Arctic air hits on Friday. Overnight temperatures will drop to -C in places up north, and to about -C where. Snow is possible over higher ground in Scotland, northern England, Wales and Northern Ireland. But weather graphs suggest snowflakes could fall as far south as London, Surrey and Kent on Saturday night.  Forecasters have also warned of rain, sleet, hail and gales that could pose a danger to drivers. Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst told the Express: Cold Arctic air will start to move in on Thursday night and will be across the whole country by the end of Friday. “Snow is likely to accumulate across high ground of Scotland and the north and we will see showers turn wintry further south, across northern and parts of central Britain. “We expect temperatures of -C in the far north on Friday night with around -C or -C further south, Saturday night is likely to be the coldest of autumn with temperatures of -C possible in Scotland.  “Ice is going to be a big concern with very low overnight temperatures coming after showers during the day, there is also going to be a widespread frost on Sunday.” Mr Dewhurst said cold gale-force winds with hail and thundershowers will hit coastal regions. Earlier this week, James Madden, of Exacta Weather, warned that snow showers could inch as far south as London. Snow showers are expected through Halloween and into early November, he added. Next month is expected to be colder than average and particularly snowy, Mr Madden warned.  The Met Office said this weeks sudden drop in temperatures will be a shock to the system after last weekends unseasonably warm weather. A spokesman said snow was unusual for this time of year but there had been snowfall in  in parts of Scotland. Met Office five-day forecast Thursday: A mainly cloudy day for Scotland and Northern Ireland, with outbreaks of rain at times, but brighter and colder later.

Gina Haspel is said to have heard an audio of the interrogation of the journalist in the Saudi consulate during a secret mission to Turkey. Sources revealed to the Daily Mirror how the Saudi consulate in Istanbul had been bugged by Turkish spies who listened in as the dissident was allegedly killed. Intelligence chiefs had launched a huge surveillance operation to track Saudi operatives in the weeks before Khashoggis death but did not expect him to be killed, it is claimed. The Washington Post reported that Haspel, a key member of Donald Trumps cabinet, had left for Turkey on Monday. A source told the paper it could now put increasing pressure on the US to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for Khashoggis death.  Bruce Riedel, a former CIA official and scholar at the Brookings Institution, said: “This puts the ball firmly in Washington’s court. “Not only will there be more pressure now from the media but Congress will say, ‘Gina, we would love to have you come visit and you can tell us exactly what you heard.’ ” On Tuesday, the Trump administration revoked visas for agents allegedly involved in the killing.  It is claimed Turkish Intelligence services learned the journalist was allegedly targeted under the orders of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in revenge for opposing his reign. The “Saudi ” hit squad included a key member of his entourage. However, the Crown has denied having any knowledge of the mission and promised to bring those responsible to justice. Mr Khashoggi was murdered in the consulate on October . Afterwards, one of his suspected killers left the building in his clothes to make it appear he was still alive. The search for Mr Khashoggi’s remains continued yesterday in the consulate garden, close to where some of his body is believed to have already been found.

Parents say they had signed consent forms - but were not informed that the school had planned to take such a large portion of their childrens hair. In previous tests the school had taken hair strands from three dferent areas on the pupils heads and had not left a mark.“They went with a hair follicle test because it goes back  days,” Superintendent Mike Gower told local news station KCA .“There’s been a lot of concerns of why don’t you use swabs  Why don’t you use urine  Those test will not go as far back.” “We should have done a better job of informing the public and informing the public we wanted it done in three spots,” he said.

Holly McKee thought something had happened to her vision in the Dundee Milton branch of the supermarket - and thousands of other people have spotted the same thing after she sparked a debate online. The -year-old shared a bizarre image of a completely grey wall of baby clothes next to a section of vividly coloured dresses and it received tens of thousands of shares and likes. But when people accused her of faking the photo she posted, she was forced to go back to the shop to prove her innocence.  Ive never seen anything like it. I had to do a double take when I saw it, she said. Initially I thought my eyes were going funny, which is why I needed confirmation from my sisters to know it wasnt just me. Holly, a retail assistant, had gone to the store with her younger sisters Abbie, , and Emily, , on Friday, October . They decided to find a Halloween costume so headed towards the George section. I had to ask themthey were seeing the same thing I was, and they were equally perplexed as it didnt seem real, Holly said. She posted the photo on social media where it has sparked a huge debate and racked up more than , shares and , likes. But some people have accused her of editing the image to make it look like the colour has been drained out of the rows of clothes.  I think people have gone mad because its quite similar to the blue and black dress from a couple years ago, and some people dont believe its real and so its playing tricks on peoples minds, she said. Determined to prove she wasnt fooling people, Holly even made a trip back to Asda to take a video of the illusion - and luckily the clothes were still in the same position. Holly said: A lot of people have been shocked as I was, thinking their eyes have gone funny. Everyone has gone crazy about it, which is why I filmed a video to show that it was all real.

All while her partner watches.But soon there may be a new way for the man to get more involved in the process and its all down to a kit created by a university student from London.  Marie-Claire Springham, a product design student at Central Saint Martins, is in the process of making a chestfeeding kit.The idea behind the product is for dads to be able to help mums who are struggling to breastfeed their newborns. Still in the conception stage, the kit is yet to be tested, but contains a cocktail of hormones that the man would take while his partner is pregnant, in order to grow milk ducts.The main hormone is progestin, a form of the female sex hormone progesterone, which helps to stimulate production of milk-producing glands.  This would be followed by a round of domperidone which is often given to mums who are experiencing dficulties with breastfeeding as it encourages the production of prolactin, a hormone which tells the womans body to produce milk. However there is one major possible side effect to taking the female hormones.Which is that the man could grow moobs or man boobs, up to a b cup until they stop taking the hormones.As well as the dferent hormones, the chestfeeding kit also contains a pump and a compression vest, which is very similar to a maternity bra.  Marie-Claire hopes her idea will help to stop fathers from feeling left out when raising their baby and believes the kit could be available in five years time. But its possible that the product may never see the light of day, as doctors have urged caution and warned that theres no proof men can even grow milk ducts. Theyre also not sure what impact the hormones will have on the male body and instead suggested other ways men could feel more included in the first few month of a babys le, such as changing them and helping with bath time.Speaking to The Sun Online, the -year-old student said: I was trying to create an empathy tool, something that could really help when a mum was struggling to breastfeed and could help a dad be of practical use."},{"url":null,"title":"fitness queen kayla itsines 27","story":"NewsFitness queen Kayla Itsines, , created £m empire making her Australias richest young womanKayla Itsines, a personal trainer, author and entrepreneur, shot to fame thanks to her exercise and wellbeing model, which she sells through her ebooks and appShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  OCT NewsKayla has a mass following of  million people on Instagram \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFitness queen Kayla Itsines has created a poundm empire - making her Australias richest young woman.

win at Tannadice to make it five wins from five games played after a % record in their Betfred Cup group.That was with an impressive  goals scored and included a deserved - win at Premiership Dundee.Now, though, Johnston faces a new man in the other dugout with intense scrutiny from fans now on him rather than his opposite number.After their perfect start to the campaign, it took Dunfermline another five matches to register a second victory in the Championship and have only racked up eight points from eight matches since.In the process they only managed six goals, conceding  and being dumped out of both the League Cup and Irn-Bru Cup on penalty shoot-outs.Going into Saturday’s game at East End Park, the Pars sit adrt of the play-off places, four points behind United in fourth place.Another poor result, after their - home defeat to Queen of the South at the weekend, will leave them well behind in the race for the top four, heaping all the pressure on Johnston and his side.And the contrast with Neilson, his United players and the atmosphere among the support is stark.After kicking off his reign with a - victory at Partick Thistle, the new gaffer led the Tangerines out for the first time at Tannadice at the weekend.Despite not managing to make it two wins from two, drawing - with Inverness CT, the players were boosted by the biggest home crowd of the campaign.The belief that Neilson can repeat the feat of promotion to the Premiership he achieved at Hearts is clear among the United support.Optimism throughout the stands has been almost completely absent over the past couple of seasons but the hope is now with former chairman Stephen Thompson having departed, and Neilson taking the reigns, good times might be on the horizon.And the ideal time to fuel that fire is now with games against sides below them in the table coming up – Dunfermline this weekend and then Queens the week after.With both the sides coming up in indferent form, points are a must to keep the good feeling flowing.Because what Dunfermline did show the last time the teams met, despite what’s happened since, is they can actually beat their bogey side United.What Neilson can’t afford now is to let the early momentum slip away, something that happened with both Ray McKinnon and, more obviously, Csaba Laszlo.Preventing that could well show the fans’ early optimism is justied come the season end."},{"url":null,"title":"jim mcintyre expected to make first dundee signing ahead of celtic clash","story":"Dundee boss Jim McIntyre is swtly set to bolster his options by adding free agent Martin Woods to his squad.The former Ross County midfielder has been without a club since leaving Partick Thistle after their relegation last season and is set to be re-united with his former gaffer.McIntyre signed Woods twice while gaffer in Dingwall, the first a month after taking charge before the -year-old had a spell down south with Shrewsbury before ing north.Woods has been training with the Dark Blues since last week and was present at last night’s -

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

So many of our players have had really big matches for their clubs in the lead up to the international but they are done now and our total focus is on Ireland this Saturday.#The spine of the squad is from Newtonmore and that should not be any surprise given they have just won the treble.#There are a few Argyll representatives aside from the team captain. Irvine#s Kyles team-mate Roddy MacDonald has also been selected and there are places for Oban Camanachd duo Lorne Dickie and Andrew MacCuish.The Scottish mantra in recent games has been to keep the ball on the ground and to use the wide open spaces to stretch the Irish defence and not allow the hurlers to build up a head of steam with their aerial game.Caberfeidh’s dead-ball expert Kevin Bartlett will again be key and he scored twelve of Scotland’s eighteen points a year ago.There are no rule changes as such this year but there will be an Irish referee, John Keane, which brings its own dimension.Garry Reid added: #The interpretation of the rules will be key. In general, Irish referees tend to let more go and there may be more of a tendency to get away with hands on the back and perhaps more pulling and shoving.#We’ll just need to be careful and concentrate on our game.

Alexander MacKenzie, , of Galloway Avenue in Ayr, was caught with a sick collection of illegal material involving animals and children thought to be as young as one-year old. Police carried out a search on September  last year and uncovered a USB stick and a HP computer terminal storing MacKenzie’s disgusting collection. Officers attended at the home MacKenzie shares with his elderly mother. She stated he was at work and told officers she only used the computer for online banking.

One movie involved two women and a black dog. And images displayed naked kids – the youngest aged between one and three. The diet was adjourned for the court to obtain social work reports.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13470760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_150718_TRUMP0013JPG.jpg","title":"ayrshire dad who blocked president","story":"NewsDaft dad in the dock after blocking Donald Trumps motorcade while he popped into the Co-op for milkPeter Goudie was stunned to be confronted with armed cops when he came out of the Maybole supermarket with his shopping.ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPeter Goudie came face-to-face with armed cops when he held up the Trump motorcade when he popped into the Co-op for milk \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe had dashed out to buy some milk from the Co-op. And the busy dad-of-three apparently had no idea that the arrival of the President of the United States was imminent. By the time he’d come out of the shop with his shopping, police were taking no chances and had removed his car from Maybole High Street. And Peter Goudie, , came face to face with officers, including armed police, who were twitchy that his Volkswagen Golf was in the way.  Donald Trump had already touched down at Prestwick in Air Force One and his cavalcade was heading to Maybole, en route to a weekend of golf and talks at Turnberry. And the convoy of the most powerful president on earth wasn’t going to be impeded by a naughty parker. The astonishing tale unfolded at Ayr Justice of the Peace Court last week. Goudie’s lawyer Peter Lockhart just managed to keep his client on the road, and he left with eight penalty points on his driving licence and a pound fine. Goudie, of The Loaning, Maybole, admitted stopping on a zig-zag line at a pelican crossing, having no insurance, taking his we’s car without permission and not having a full licence.  Depute fiscal Ed Sheeran told the Justice on the bench that at around pm on Friday, July  there was a major police operation on-going on the A. He said that it was part of a management plan due to the visit of the president of the United States of America. The court was told that there was a large police presence in Maybole High Street and that they had noticed the grey Golf was stopped on the zig-zags. They found Goudie inside the shop and the offences unfolded.  Mr Lockhart told the court Goudie’s we was out and he had decided to pop down to the Co-op to get some milk. The solictior added: “My client had not noticed the high police presence. “He was alarmed when he was approached by the police in the shop and even more alarmed when he came out and saw more police, including armed police in the vicinity.” Mr Lockhart explained that it had been a costly exercise as the police had removed and impounded his car. He added: “His we was furious when she found out as it cost pound to get the car back the following day. “He was in the dog house for his stupidity.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEd SheeranVolkswagenJusticePrestwickDonald TrumpAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"bus chiefs issue another safety","story":"NewsBus chiefs issue another safety warning on Ayrshire bus routeIt has been reported that children have been “cycling in a dangerous manner” in front of buses travelling through the Patna scheme.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsStagecoach bus route  as it passes through Patna \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBus services through Patna are at risk - for the second time in less than a year.

have led to many people falling into hardship or dropping out of the benefit system altogether.The introduction of the two-child benefit cap, limiting tax credits and Universal Credit to a familys first two children has also been attacked.And the Tory list MSPs attempt to justy the two-child cap this week was met with anger and disbelief.Ms Ballantyne told Holyrood: \"The two-child limit is about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating inequality, austerity and poverty when Ms Ballantyne mounted her defence.Nationalist MSP Tom Arthur described her words as one of the most disgraceful speeches Ive ever heard.He said: \"In my two and half years in this parliament, the contribution from Michelle Ballantyne was one of the most disgraceful speeches I have ever heard.\"Six minutes of pompous Victorian moralising, that would have been better suited to the pages of a Dickens novel.\"And to suggest that poverty should be a barrier to a family, that people who are poor are not entitled to any more than two children - what an absolutely disgraceful position.\"Ms Ballantynes words were also met with anger in Westminster today.Pete Wishart, the SNPs shadow leader of the House of Commons, told Parliament: \"We dont want these

This is hard for me as I am disabled and struggle to take it in and out when I use the shower.At my former address the replacement bags were thrown into the garden at collection time.

RoundThe Pupils never really got going in this cup-tie, ending the game as second best to a moderately talented visiting side.Kinross were fortunate to be confronted by a uncharacteristically tame performance from the McFadyen sponsored home favourites.Lacking the key elements of drive, determination and quick controlled possession, the home side, playing with a threadbare squad due to injury and call-offs  used the long ball far too often in the first half.During the first twenty minutes the Pupils had territorial advantage, but were never able to string enough passes together to make a telling impact on the game.With the visitors hardly an attacking force, the home crowd was shocked when Kinross unexpectedly grabbed the lead shortly before half time.It’s ironic given that the Pupils back four seemed to be on top of their game, that one mistake should prove so costly.There seemed little danger, but the ball was lost in a crucial area and turned across goal for the incoming forward to score with the visitor’s only shot of the whole first half.The second half began disastrously for the home side, a through ball exposing the last line of defence whose first real action was to pick the ball out of the net.Given what went before, it was unimaginable that the Pupils were two goals behind at this stage the visitor’s ‘smash and grab’ tactics a complete contradiction to their earlier failure to attack.With the confidence of an unexpected but comfortable two goal cushion, the Fe League side turned the screw by controlling possession from the back.Mistakes had cost the home side dear, and, for the first time in the match the visitors looked like a team heading for the next round of the Scottish Cup!The home side tried desperately to retrieve the situation, but gaps appeared at the back as they threw caution to the wind.The keeper, young Alastair Ferguson, saved the day by fisting clear inside the six yard box, a timely intervention which kept the Pupils in the game at a crucial stage.Almost immediately, the home side were awarded a penalty kick on the back of a wild challenge in the box, and Gary Grumoli drove the ball into the net.Sensing blood, the Pupils powered forward at last using the ball to good effect with some fine possession football.However, it proved a  dawn and only a prequel to another defensive mistake which resulted in the visitor’s restoring their two goal cushion via a poacher’s finish from point blank range.In a breathtaking finish, the Pupils gained a second penalty with minutes remaining however, resisting the urge to change the kicker, Gary Grumoli placed his second effort to the keeper’s opposite side, only to see his kick saved dramatically.It was the final act of an uninspiring, but ultimately exciting game.The Pupils will try to put the cup disappointment behind them when they travel to play old foes, Hillington, in a league fixture tomorrow.Ellis Robertson played a solid game in the centre. _cpupilsvkinrossRyan

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

Members are drawn from local residents, licensees, health professionals and police.The board, which approved its new revised licensing policy for the next five years at a meeting earlier in the morning, scrapped the overprovision statement.Forum member Elizabeth Oldcorn said the decision was ldquodisappointing and against the views of the forum and the NHS, which she represents on it.She said: ldquoI think the board has done itself a disservice.And concerns were raised that not having an overprovision statement ndash which allows the board to reject licence applications from new premises on the argument an area already has enough premises ndash left it vulnerable.Forum convenor George Hood warned: ldquoI thinkyou do not have an overprovision statement you will find it very dficult not to grant a licence.The board argued that, while there were ldquosignicant health and crime problems in our communities that should not be ignored and ldquoaccess to alcohol is a key issue, it did not believe the harm caused by alcohol in East Lothian was a ldquodirect and sole consequence of the number of premises.Councillor Jane Henderson, board member, said: ldquoWe have to be absolutely certain about the causal link.Rudi Fruzynski, the boardrsquos licensing standards officer, said that one of the issues was a lack of guidance from the Scottish Government as to what qualied as overprovision.He said: ldquoThere has not been clear guidance from the Governmentrsquos policy unit.ldquoIt does not give us the information needed to put a policy in place with confidence it will not be challenged."},{"url":null,"title":"six-new-electric-vehicle-charging-points-for-east-lothian","story":"The Department for Transportcash will create chargepoints in residential areas in Aberlady, Dunbar, Stenton, North Berwick and West Barns.East Lothian Council applied to the DfTrsquos Office of Low Emission Vehiclesfor the funds following calls from residents who wanted to invest in electric cars.The new funds will be topped-up with money from Transport Scotland.Councillor Norman Hampshire, the councilrsquos cabinet member for the environment, said: ldquoThese chargepoints will improve access for everyone in the area, not just the residents who made the initial approach.ldquoIrsquod encourage anyone with suggestions about locations for new points to get in touch.The cash comes on top of pound, funding from Transport Scotland awarded to the council this year to increase the number of electric vehicle charging points.The six locations for new electric chargepoints are: Haddington Road, Aberlady Church Car Park, Stenton Forth View, West Barns Links Road, North Berwick Dunbar Leisure Centre Car Park and Dunbar High Street Car Park."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-halloween-tale","story":"HIDDEN on the edge of Gford woods are the lonely ruins of Yester Castle. The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

voted on Wednesday to include the change in the SNP governmentrsquos planning bill.The amendment was proposed by Green MSP Andy Wightman, who has campaigned for residents affected by an explosion in short-term lets in central Edinburgh.The Lothians MSP has criticised the ease with which landlords can let out properties for a few days to noisy stag and hen parties, regardless of the impact on neighbours.He told MSPs last year that some residents were also disturbed by ldquoaudible sex parties.At the parliamentrsquos local government committee, Mr Wightman tabled an amendment to the PlanningBill designed to make ldquoshort-term holiday lets harder for landlords.The Bill is intended to modernise Scotlandrsquos main planning law, which predates devolution.During line-by-line scrutiny at Stage  of the Bill, Mr Wightman proposed classing the change of a dwellinghouse to a short-term holiday let as a ldquomaterial change of use.Such a change requires a landlord to obtain full planning permission, a greater bureaucratic and financial burden which could also be objected to by neighbours.Local councils would determine applications on the basis of local policy, and the changes would not affect homeowners or occupiers who only rent out a room.It would be for Scottish minister to offer guidance on what counts as a short-term holiday let.The Greens later said the change was aimed squarely at landlords leasing properties per night on websites such as Airbnb, which lists more than  properties in the capital.The minority Scottish Government, which opposed the amendment, could try to overturn it at the planning billrsquos third and final stage, but would face cross-party oppositionit tried.The Scottish Tories, whose leader Ruth Davidson represents Edinburgh Central where constituents are blighted by short-term lets, are in favour in the change.Mr Wightman said: ldquoThe uncontrolled and rapid rise in short-term lets in our cities and our rural communities is depriving families and iniduals of badly-needed long-term homes.ldquoI am pleased that the Minister has agreed to discuss this matter further as the Bill progresses through Parliament.At the same committee, MSPs also voted for a Tory amendment which would help councils acquire land more cheaply through compulsory purchase.The lsquoland value capturersquo change enables local authorities to benefit from the increase in the value of land when it gets planning permission, with the uplt helping to pay for affordable housing and infrastructure.It means the amount councils pay to landowners in new ldquomasterplan consent areas will be close to existing use value, not inflated by the prospect of development.Arable land can increase -fold and brownfield land -fold after planning permission.Tory MP Graham Simpson, who moved the amendment, said it would apply when a council established a Simplied Development Zone.Tory Alexander Stewart, Labourrsquos Monica Lennon and Mr Wightman also backed the plan.Mr Simpson said: ldquoThe inclusion of land value capture in this bill will enable councils to invest the money gained through their decisions to grant planning permission on affordable housing, new roads and better infrastructure.ldquoImportantly, this amendment also ensures that compensation is payable to those whose land is purchased. I believe that this amendment will help transform the landscape of residential and economic development in Scotland.ldquoMost crucially, this will enable more houses to be built, more communities to be created andmore people will have more opportunity to own their own home.Mr Wightman added: ldquoWith average house prices seven and a half times the average salary we must take every opportunity we can to help people afford to buy or rent a home.ldquoGiving local councils the power to buy land at existing use value rather than the inflated value caused by planning permission is an important tool in the box.ldquoA classic example is the Waterfront in Edinburgh where there are swathes of vacant land that have been allocated for housing for years. Developers have been biding their time while the land value rises and the cityrsquos housing crisis worsens.ldquoThis land should be available for the council to buy at its current value so it can get on with the job of building affordable housing for ownership and rent."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8858593.jpg?type=article-full","title":"tartan-pimpernels-heroics-become-play","story":"And now the WWII adventures of the Rev Dr Donald Caskie are to be celebrated once again with a play performed on the Hebridean island where he grew up.A new stage play about the Church of Scotland minister, who helped save more than , allied troops, is to be staged in his home village of Bowmore on Islay on November .Rev Donald Caskie, the Tartan PimpernelPlaywright John Hughes described the event as a ldquohomecoming for the war hero minister, who was leading the Scots Kirk in Paris when the Germans invaded France in .:Scots war hero minister the Tartan Pimpernels Bible ed to his old church#He said he was inspired to write about Dr Caskiersquos adventures after he learned that his Gaelic Bible had been ed to the church last year.The three-man play, which is based on the ministerrsquos book, The Tartan Pimpernel, is being staged in Bowmore Hall.Sponsored by the Islay Festival, eight members of the Caskie family will be in attendance and Bowmore distillery will provide people with a welcome dram.Mr Hughes of Glasgow, said: ldquoWe wanted to take the play about the story of this forgotten Scottish minister back to his home town of Bowmore to celebrate his le on the island where he was born.ldquoThis is where his character was formed sitting at the peat fire listening to his mother and attending Sunday school.ldquoIt is the place where he first learned the French and Gaelic languages that would prove useful during the war.\"Tom CaskieRev Caskie minister denounced the Nazis from his pulpit and when the Germans invaded Paris he had to flee the city.While in southern France, he refused the chance of safe passage on the last ship bound for the UK and fled to Marseille instead.There he ran a Seamans Mission, living a double le and passing the close scrutiny of the Vichy Police, and helped British and Allied soldiers to freedom across mountains into Spain.:Scot who died in Auschwitz honoured  years after her death#He was eventually recruited by British Intelligence officers and was told that his mission was the last link of a chain of safe houses that they had set up, which stretched from the beaches of Dunkirk in northern France to Marseille in the south.With nothing to trust but God and his instincts, the crofters son operated in the Seamans Mission for many months until he was betrayed by a traitor.Dr Caskie, who is remembered for his humble yet joyful nature, was eventually arrested by the Vichy Police, interrogated and banished from Marseille.He moved to Grenoble where he continued to arrange for the escape of soldiers, seamen and airmen under the cover of being a university chaplain.Dr Caskie was finally imprisoned by the Gestapo and sentenced to death.The minister, who was given his nickname by the BBC, had ignored repeated calls from British Intelligence and the Church of Scotland tohome.His le was only saved through the intervention of a German pastor and he spent the rest of the war in a Prisoner of War camp.Graeme Dallas plays Rev CaskieThe play, which stars Graeme Dallas as Dr Caskie, who was made an OBE in  and honoured by the French Government, is currently on a mini tour of Scotland.Dr Caskiersquos nephew, Tom Caskie, who gted the leather bound Gaelic Bible to the Scots Kirk, said he was looking forward to the performance.

Scotland was one of the first countries to adopt the global targets of the United Nationsrsquo  Sustainable Development Goals.These are a universal call to action for all countries to tackle poverty and inequality, protect the planet and ensure peace, prosperity and justice for all. ldquoThis vision is underpinned by the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyrsquosown regulatory strategy, One Planet Prosperity, which aims to deliver environmental protection and improvement in ways which help communities and businesses thrive within the resources of our planet, explains SEPArsquos head of innovation, Catherine Preston.ldquoScotlandrsquos businesses have a critical role to play in leading Scotlandrsquos contribution to achieving Sustainable Development Goals ndash this will also realise the economic benefit of increased resource efficiency, innovation and resilience.This has inspired a new collaboration between SEPA and ICASto help businesses integrate Sustainable Development Goals into theirday-to-day work.Last month SEPA and ICAS hosted the inaugural meeting of the Scottish Sustainable Development Goals Reporting Working Group, which broughttogether leading businesses, trade bodies, regulators, charities, universities and government agencies.The launch followed on from Making Global Goals Local Business, the  Sustainable Development Goals roadshow hosted by the UnitedNations Global Compact Network UK. This is one of more than  local networks set up by UN Global Compact around the world to help translate Sustainable Development Goals into business action and innovation.ldquoThe Scottish SDGs Reporting Working Group is focusing on two key challenges, Preston says. ldquoFirstly, how can businesses seize the opportunities of Sustainable Development Goals by building them into their business models and also benefit the Scottish economy, environment and most importantly, our people  ldquoSecondly, how can the Scottish approach to One Planet Prosperity and Sustainable Development Goals create transformational impact across the UK and globally These are big ambitions. So the vision is to translate the global helicopter view of Sustainable Development Goals into practical hands-on tools andapproaches that can be used in the day-to-day work of businesses ndash with benefit for them, their local communities and the environment.There are already great examples in Scotland of Sustainable Development Goals in action. For example, Scottish Water and SEPA have signed a Sustainable Growth Agreement focused on finding new ways to recover more resources from the wastes it manages and generates. It aims to contribute to ten of the Sustainable DevelopmentGoals. On the Isle of Lewis, the Outer Hebrides Local Energy Hub is an innovative partnership project between Comhairle nan Eilean Siar , Community Energy Scotland, Pure Energy Centre and The Scottish Salmon Company demonstrating how dferent renewable energy technologies can be integrated to support local energy economiesand circular supply chains.In the retail industry, brands including Aldi, Asda, Ikea, Boots and Next have signed up to the British Retail Consortiumrsquos Better Retail Better World initiative, which sets out a range of targets in line with Sustainable Development Goals. There are many more examples ndash and the hope is that businesses will share ideas and experiences through the new Scottish SDGs Reporting Working Group.ldquoThe group will run for  months, with the aim of delivering a suite of practical tools and approaches by st April  ndash World Creativity and Innovation Day, Preston explains. ldquoWersquoll do this through themed events and building partnerships, with an initial focus on strategy and reporting to create a consistent approach for everyone.Then wersquoll look at dferent lsquoScotlandrsquos businesses have a critical role to play in leading our contribution to achieving Sustainable Development Goals approaches based on dferent types and sizes of organisations, because a global financial institution might take a dferent approach to a small business or a non-governmental organisation. The last stage will involve pulling together our learnings and experience into a package of tools, simple guidance and case studies for promoting more widely to businesses.SEPArsquos One Planet Prosperity strategy reflects that society is currently using the resources of three planets, and needs to live within its means. ICAS also promotes best practice amongst its members on environmentalsustainability and related corporate social responsibility issues.This includes the importance of building sustainability measures into the reporting of company accounts, to help drive decision-making in this area.ldquoICAS and SEPA could have steered this initiative on their own, but something much bigger and better will be delivered through businesses driving the working group and collaborating to develop shared ideas and action, Preston concludes.Organisations interested in helping to shape the future of sustainable development goal action and reporting, can contact Catherine Preston, SEPArsquoshead of innovation.The Heraldrsquos Climate for Change initiative supports efforts being made by the Scottish Government with key organisations and campaign partners.

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Thursday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmNHS Orkney have officially confirmed today that its post of chief executive will be filled by Gerry O#Brien.

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much.

Alistair lived next door to Marie-Annyrsquos Scottish exchange partner, Sandra, daughter of the late Sandy and Lilly Macrae.With some of those attending a th anniversary meeting in Dingwall now in their s and s, there was much to catch on. One of those present, George Robertson, said the stark contrast between the new and old Dingwall Academy buildings amazed those present.\"The day began with a guided tour of Dingwall Academy, graciously hosted by rector, Mrs Karen Cormack and two equally charming assistants, Ceitidh Petrie of fth Year and head girl, Anna-Maria Stewart of sixth year. We were amazed by the change in the Academy mdash from the grim corridors with its memories of rooms with formal rows of desks, piles of jotters and frequent administrations of summary justice mdash with the lsquoLochgelly Specialrsquo mdash to the cosy, student-friendly comfort of modern classrooms, sumptuously equipped with digital projectors and interactive whiteboards.\"Gone are the dingy cloakrooms, in the corners of which, stressed-out procrastinators struggled furiously to finish their homework on time! Gone too, are the endless, uncouth nicknames we used to give our teachers, Pirrac, Froggy, Daisy-lugs, Kate Stew, Inky, Willie the War, Kramer, Horace, Scabbac, Sinkie, Snottery Tom and so on.\"He added: \"We soon realised that Dingwall Academy is a much happier, kinder place than the strictly regimented establishment, where we learned, suffered, cried, laughed and fell in, and out, of love! The old school, however, was not all bad, because we had the good fortune of being taught by many caring, brilliant teachers who inspired and challenged us, and whom we still remember with great fondness. J.K.Inkson was one of those par excellence, but kind and modest, despite his many gts.\"After welcome refreshments in the Academy cafe, the group enjoyed a tour of Dingwall Museum.Mr Robertson said: \"The culminating highlight of our day was, without doubt, the get-together and dinner in the Royal Hotel, Cromarty. We were able to catch up with more of our old friends and former schoolmates. We were formally welcomed by Sandra Collardand by Marie-Anny, who addressed us in flawless English. The dinner was a splendid affair, with a host of gastonomic delicacies, all excellently prepared.\"The old friends recalled the lasting benefits of their exchanges down the years. Mr Robertson said: \"We were particularly glad to have a representative of the Inkson family with us, in the form of J.K.rsquos daughter, Helen, and we were pleased to hear a message of greeting from his son, Kerr, who lives in Auckland, New Zealand.\"Kerr wrote of his pride in the job his father had done, developing and managing the exchanges. He also wished us all a happy evening together. We remembered with fondness, all those who were no longer with us, and especially J.K.Inkson himself, to whose memory all drank a fitting toast.\"Warm thanks were also expressed to Sandra Collard who helped maintain contacts and organise the event and Marie-Anny who \"emulated mdash and surpassed mdash her fictional compatriot, Monsieur Poirot, in locating so many of our Belgian friends\".Although Marie-Anny was the only surviving Belgian veteran who felt able to undertake the long journey to Ross-shire, Mr Robertson said: \"There has been a great exchange of email addresses, and it looks like the ether will be buzzing with electronic correspondence between old friends in Britain and Belgium.\"Well done, Marie-Anny and Sandra, for giving us one of the most memorable days of our lives, and thank you Alistair, for your magical photographic memories of this wonderful occasion!\"Thursday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The ersion could then reopen to traffic shortly after a train clears the other side.Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford has been campaigning for the revised system with support from Scottish Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson.Mr Blackford said: \"This has the potential to be great news and work now must be put in place to make these plans a reality. I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue. Let me be frank, these changes would not have been possible without the intervention of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson MSP.\"The local communities deserve a huge amount of credit as well. Local representatives have campaigned tirelessly and have sought to keep people informed when information wasnrsquot always forthcoming from Highland Council.\"I hope now that we can move forward from what has been an extremely trying situation for local communities.\"Network Rail confirmed the new system is something it is actively looking into, but that it was not yet in a position to proceed and had no specic start date for its introduction.But a spokesman added that the system was similar to one that was introduced on the same stretch of track in  after another serious landslide, so the idea is feasible.Thursday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking.

I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that.

This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Thursday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27489  ","story":" Michael McMonagleThirty years ago today the British government, fearful of the growth of Sinn Féin, introduced the broadcasting ban to stop Sinn Féin representatives being heard on television and radio. The ban was introduced by the British governments Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd on October , . The ban was brought in an attempt to halt the growth of Sinn Féin in the north and to prevent a wider audience hearing a republican analysis of the ongoing conflict at the time. It prevented Sinn Féin representatives from appearing on television and radio interviews. When it was first introduced many broadcasters were unsure of how it should be implemented and effectively blocked all republicans from the broadcast media, even those who were not members of Sinn Féin. Broadcasters and journalists unions disliked the ban because of the disruption it caused and some sought ways to get around it, the most well known being the actors voice compromise where actors were brought in to speak the words of Sinn Féin representatives. This led to the bizarre situation where viewers could see Sinn Féin representatives on their screens but could not hear their voices. Several actors who went on to have successful stage and screen careers started out by providing the voices for Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and others. Of course, this was not the first time Sinn Féin representatives had been banned from the airwaves the Irish government used a similar tactic  years earlier. Section  of the Broadcasting Act, introduced in , banned Sinn Féin representatives from the media. RTÉ went further and extended the ban to all expressions of republican opinion, including popular ballads. As the peace process progressed the ban appeared more and more ludicrous, forcing the British government to abandon it in . Following the lting of the ban, Raymond McCartney became the first Sinn Féin representative to have his own voice heard in a  television interview. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain. “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet.

It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8670196.1539680805!/image/image.jpg","title":"council rolls out 2018 enterprise week activities","story":"With this year#s Enterprise Week rolling out from November  to , businesses and entrepreneurs across the borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon are being urged to be part of this enterprising initiative.Spearheaded by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council and sponsored by Bank of Ireland, the week-long programme will see a range of inspirational and informative events take place across the borough, demonstrating council’s commitment to nurturing and developing the local economy.

We will have state of the art facilities, this will be a top rate training facility for local clubs and schools. Our kids deserve this. There will be high-tech lighting that will illuminate the pitch but won’t effect the houses near by.“It’s vital that local kids get full use of this facility, we want it filled to capacity every day with schools, we envisage coaches training kids here, Gaelic clubs, soccer clubs, after-schools activities and outdoor gym classes. I believe this will transform the community.”Work is due to begin in December andall goes according to plan it should be completed by the end of March.Cllr Baker said the investment by Belfast City Council is a big boost for the community. “This area suffered badly under Lisburn Council and we are delighted now that this huge investment has come into the area.

Myself and other volunteers would prepare Sunday dinner, talk to those using the centre, after the centre moved to Divis we still take it in turns to prepare, serve and wash up after Sunday dinner.“I asked the Bishop and he has agreed for me to start a new chaplaincy to the homeless and the idea of that is to find out what the spiritual needs of the homeless are and I really want to take the lead on that. As a deacon we are available to go to wake houses, visit with the sick and assist at the altar.”The -year-old described the ordination ceremony on Sunday as one he “enjoyed every minute of”.“I have a lot of friends who are Presbyterian, Protestants and everyone said how much they enjoyed it too, that they had never seen anything like it in their lives. There were four Bishops there and beautul music from Louis McVeigh, the Cathedral was packed and we had a ball. It lashed all day Saturday and the sun came out on Sunday, it was great after four years to finally get it done.”Gregory – whose first job at  was selling the Andersonstown News around the Norfolk area – said the deacons intend to make a really good dference in their parishes and act “as an extra pair of hands across a iety of ministries”.“In my view, the homeless, the poor, the sick, whether mentally or physically are the aristocracy of the Church and I say that word very deliberately. Pope Francis is saying it all the time now.“We have got to take people seriously when they lose someone, whether they are aged  to  in terms of their grief, give our resources, our time, this is what the Church is for.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newington boss crossan demands swift improvement","story":"Steel and Sons Cup quarter-finalSt James’ Swts vNewington Donegal Celtic ParkNEWINGTON manager, Conor Crossan has demanded an improved showing from his side as they continue the defence of their Steel and Sons Cup title with a quarter-final away trip to St James’ Swts on Saturday. The North Belfast side suffered a - home defeat to Lurgan Celtic earlier this month as they lost ground to Championship  league leaders Annagh United. Last Saturday, they bowed out of the Intermediate Cup following a - penalty shoot-out defeat at Maiden City after the game finished - after  minutes. Crossan feels Saturday’s game is the perfect opportunity for his side to rediscover their form in a competition that is close to their hearts. “We are looking forward to Saturday, hopefully we can get back to winning ways,” said Crossan.“The boys know that the performances haven’t been good enough over the last couple of weeks. “We want to stay in as many cup competitions as we can because of the way the league is structured. “It was a poor result and a poor performance against Lurgan Celtic and we had a few players out last Saturday, but it was sore getting beat on penalties.“You always want to be going into the big games on the back of a win and our form of the last two weeks hasn’t been good. “We are going into this match against a team that has won  from  so they’ll be full of confidence. It will be up to me to get the team up for this game.” As defending champions, Newington will be the favourites to progress, especially considering they play in a higher league. Yet, the progress made by St James’ Swts hasn’t gone unnoticed in the north of the city and Crossan is refusing to underestimate the challenge posed by the Swts at Donegal Celtic Park on Saturday. “People might underestimate the Ballymena League, but you have some great teams in that league – the likes of Bangor and Coagh and teams who were in Championship  in recent years,” added the Newington boss. “They are playing at a good level and they have players who have experience of playing in the Irish League. “They’ll be full of confidence and I don’t think they lost too much sleep when they drew us.“They are the type of team who relish the challenge no matter who they face. “They’ve been making noise for a while now.“They will want to build on that start and keep going, but hopefully we can put a stop to that winning run on Saturday.” St James’ Swts assistant manager Dan Murphy, meanwhile, insists the club is “buzzing” ahead of Saturday’s eagerly-anticipated clash with the defending Steel and Sons Cup champions. The West Belfast side have made an incredible start to the   season and have won all  of their game so far. The only stain on an otherwise perfect start came when they lost the points following their - win over last year’s Ballymena and Provincial League winners Glebe after it emerged one of their players should have been serving a suspension arising from a ban with his previous club. St James’ are aiming to go a step further than they managed in last season’s competition when they bowed out after losing - to Linfield Swts in the last eight.  “The whole club is buzzing, we know how big this competition is. We got to this stage last year and we lost out to Linfield Swts,” said Murphy. “We were - down and we gave a penalty away and went - down. “We got a goal back and we threw everything at them to get an equaliser and we make a silly mistakes and they broke and made it -. “It was a bit gut-wrenching. We wanted to go on further in the competition and we are just hoping to go one step further this year and make it into the semi-finals.” Last season, the Swts challenged for promotion from the Ballymena and Provincial League Premier Division, but fell short at the end of a busy campaign. This season, they are, strictly speaking, unbeaten on the pitch and Murphy feels that is in no small part because of the summer signings made by manager Damien McStravick. “Last year, we knew we had a good team and we were playing good football,” said Murphy. “Towards the end of the season, it was just injuries and suspensions that killed us.“Our squad was a bit light and a few boys had to play with knocks. “During the summer, we made some brilliant signings thanks to Damien McStravick. He met boys who had played at a higher level and sold them on the ethos of the club. “We ended up with a smashing squad. “We kept all the players we had last year and we’ve added a bit more quality to it. “The new boys have all bought into what the club is about and they are enjoying their football.” This Saturday, St James’ bid to continue their incredible start to the season by dumping the holders out of the Steel and Sons Cup. However, Murphy is expecting a tough battle from the North Belfast side given that Newington went on to defeat Linfield Swts in last year’s Christmas Day final at Seaview. “They are a very dogged team and they work hard for each other. They are able to take their chances when they get them,” added the St James’ Swts assistant. “We also know they are the champions of this competition and they’re no going to let go of it easily. “We played them in pre-season and we won that game -, but they signed well after that game. “We know we are going to be up against it and it will be a real test. “We have to be at our best, but the way we are playing, I thinkwe show up on the day, we can win the game.” Newington will be without the suspended duo of Gavin Taggart and Kevin Bradley for Saturday’s clash while St James’ Swts are set to be at full strength for the quarter-final tie."},{"url":null,"title":"chinabuilt titanic ii to set sail in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The company behind the plan, Blue Star Line, said the new ship will include all the latest safety and technical equipment to make it fit for the st Century seas. Originally the Titanic was owned by the White Star Line.Reports claim there will be nine decks and  staterooms that can accommodate , passengers and  crew members, the same as the Belfast original.First, second, and third class tickets will be available, just like the original and there will be a swimming pool, gymnasiums, and Turkish bath.However, the engines will be diesel-powered rather than coal fired but the iconic smoke stacks will remain. Clive Palmer, the Autralian business man behind the project said the maiden voyage will take travellers from Southampton to New York on the same route as the ill-fated  voyage. Then it will cruise around the world from Dubai hoping to \"enchant\" passengers with the style of the old world mixed with the new.It has been rumoured the ship will first lt anchor in , however, the company has said it is still in the early stages of planning and due diligence for the plan. “Millions have dreamt of sailing on her, seeing her in port and experiencing her unique majesty. Titanic II will be the ship where those dreams come true,” Clive Palmer said, thereported. A computer generated graphic of the new Titanic II.“The ship will follow the original journey, carrying passengers from Southampton to New York, but she will also circumnavigate the globe, inspiring and enchanting people while attracting unrivalled attention, intrigue and mystery in every port she visits.\"Speculation over the project has gathered pace over recent weeks after a series of announcements from Blue Star Line. On Tuesday it announced it would base its European office in Paris as opposed to London which will open in March .The photograph shows bodies in sacks piled three high on the deck of the CS Mackay Bennett, before being tipped overboard as the ships priest conducts a service. Photo issued by Henry Aldridge and Son.“It is of little use having a European headquarters outside Europe,’’ Mr Palmer said.Mr Palmer confirmed discussions were underway between project’s World Director and suppliers and consultants world-wide to get Titanic II underway as soon as possible.And last week the company announced the appointment of a European director - who had originally been part of the project in  - for the project who will be responsible for commercial negotiations, recruitment and training for Titanic II, the company said. At the end of September, the company released a new technical specications update in a YouTube video. Palmer was a former elected member of the Australian parliament and has announced he is standing again for election under the slogan \"Make Australia Great Again\". He has a dinosaur theme park in Australia and the Titanic project plan has been described as his \"pet project\". A second Titanic II is also being built in a theme park in China. However it will remain docked and not take on sailings.

Evidence shows that money made from the sale of counterfeit goods is used to fund other forms of crime. Also, by purchasing illegal goods, revenue to the legitimate economy is lost putting jobs at risk and resulting in less money available for public services like health and education. Communities end up paying the price whilst paramilitaries profit. “I would appeal for anyone with information regarding criminality by paramilitary organisations to contact police on .

The DUP are isolationists and on the wrong side of the argument and the democratic will of the people.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

It is vitally important the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site is used for the benefit of the community,he continued.ldquoAny future planning applications will involve a consultation process that enables the public to have their say on the future development.The Downpatrick councillor suggested that given the current parking and traffic flow issues at Edward Street, there was a need for an ultra-modern primary school in the town to continue to provide a high standard of childrenrsquos education.He declared: ldquoI believe the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site would be ideal for a new school development and will be writing to the Education Authority to ask that they investigate the sitersquos potential for such a development.ldquoI will also be asking Newry, Mourne and Down Council to review options for this site as it could also be ideal for other community facilities.A spokesman for the diocese of Down and Connor confirmed on Monday that the former St Patrickrsquos Boys Primary School site will be placed on the market for sale.He added: ldquoThe diocesan Trustees are legally bound to act in the best interests of the charity and to consider all offers made through the public market process.ldquoIn the case of sales of former school sites, the diocesan Trustees are required toa substantial percentage of the sale price to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.A number of people have taken to social media in the wake of news that the former school site is to be sold and expressed concern about the impact its redevelopment could have on an already heavily congested part of the town.Several have suggested a new school should be built on the site, while others believe its redevelopment could have problems securing planning permission given the topography of this part of the town and traffic congestion in nearby Edward Street.A number of people said they would not be in favour of any form of retail development at the former school site..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Staff being followed home by unruly teenagers  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick have revealed that some members of staff have been followed home by unruly teenagers who are terrorising the town centre with their behaviour.The worrying revelation came during a meeting held last week to discuss mounting concern about increasing anti-social behaviour in St Patrickrsquos Square, the Grove shopping centre area and other parts of the town.Within  hours of last weekrsquos meeting concluding, a firework was thrown at a customer as he left a hot food bar in St Patrickrsquos Square, narrowly missing him.Business owners fear someone is going to have to be seriously injured or worse before the ongoing trouble is addressed.They say the anti-social behaviour cannot be allowed to continue in the area, or in any other part of Downpatrick, and insist there must be immediate action to be bring the trouble to an end.Last weekrsquos meeting between local police, business owners and elected representatives was organised by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has revealed there were a number of frank exchanges, with all those in attendance describing the talks as ldquoworthwhile.He also confirmed another session involving the parties is due to be held in mid-November.A businessman said it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory that people who were trying to do a dayrsquos work should be terrorised by  and  year-old children operating outside the control of their parents and the police.ldquoIt is now getting dficult to recruit staff in Downpatrick town centre, he revealed.ldquoWe do not have these problems in Newcastle or Ardglass. Self-employed retailers pay tax and rates in an expectation that the government and Newry, Mourne and Down Council will ensure that the environment in our town centres is suitable for business and attractive to customers. We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence. The creation of a filter lane allowing drivers wishing to turn left out of the Ballynoe Road would help reduce congestion, he said. lsquoThe provision of a new filter lane is a no brainer.Cllr Curran said that while roads officials previously identied a scheme to provide a new filter lane, they subsequently decided that, due to the close proximity of the Glebetown Drive housing area, a new slip road would cause ldquoroad safety issues.He added: ldquoI firmly believe that the time has come to revisit this particular proposal.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

Ann Travers, whose sister Mary was murdered by the IRA in  She also voiced serious concerns over revelations about a Sinn Fein minister reporting to unelected figures within the republican movement, claiming: “The IRA hasn’t gone away. They are up at Stormont making the decisions.”Ms Travers, who along with TUV leader Jim Allister championed the introduction of the Civil Service Special AdvisersBill in , was reacting to statements made during Tuesday’s inquiry hearing by former Finance Minister Mairtin O Muilleoir, during which he confirmed that Sinn Fein had effectively ignored the law on employing Spads.Although the legislation was introduced five years ago, Mr O Muilleoir told the inquiry that Sinn Fein put in place a structure to allow one-time senior IRA member Aidan McAteer – then Spad to Martin McGuinness – to continue in his role, because they disagreed with the law.The Civil Service Spad Bill, which became known as Ann’s Law, was designed to prevent ex-prisoners who were jailed for five years or more from becoming highly paid political advisers. It was brought forward after former IRA prisoner Mary McArdle – who was involved in the slaying of Mary Travers – was appointed as adviser to Sinn Fein Culture Minister Caral Ni Chuilin in .Reacting to Mr O Muilleoir’s comments, Ms Travers pointed out that while Sinn Fein may be employing advisers with serious criminal records, they are being paid out of party funds rather than the public purse.But condemning their circumnavigation of the law, she said: “I think it is quite abhorrent that they ignore and still don’t get the hurt that was caused that actually caused this Bill to come into being. They haven’t learnt anything from it.”Branding Sinn Fein’s actions as “anti-peace process”, she continued: “It shows that whenever the law suits Sinn Fein they will use it, butthey don’t like it then they ignore it.“We just had a consultation about dealing with the past and legacy issues, and here heis sitting saying Sinn Fein just didn’t agree with a piece of legislation that was brought forward with a victim and with plenty of victims supporting it. All that was being asked of Sinn Fein was to acknowledge the families’ hurt and help them, yet they couldn’t even do that.”With the RHI Inquiry having uncovered details about how Mr O Muilleoir reported to a series of unelected republican figures – one of whom, Padraic Wilson is reportedly one of the most senior members of the IRA – Ms Travers questionedSinn Fein is just “a face” for “shady characters lurking in the shadows.”“It just seems they are just there as a face and they just do what they are told to do and say. People need to be aware that whenever they are voting for their local Sinn Fein candidate, actually in reality are they really able to do anything  Is it really them that you’re voting for or are you voting for these shady characters in the background, still lurking in the shadows, still telling themwhat they can and can’t do, what laws they should follow, which ones they should ignore  I just find it completely depressing.“We have just had the anniversary of the Shankill bomb. We are having other anniversaries this week of other people who were murdered in retaliation, including Greysteel, so you would think at this stage we should be able to trust our politicians, but actually it looks, certainly for this particular political party , that we can’t trust them at all because we don’t know who we are talking to.”DUP and SF asked man involved in RHI to find ‘independent’ investigator Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Stressing that trust and trusting people are major issues for victims and survivors, she continued: “Here we are in ,  years on from the Good Friday Agreement. I would have thought by this stage in politics and as a society we should be maturing and working towards a true reconciliation where we actually know that when we sit and talk to somebody that the person we are dealing with is the person who is in front of us and not this unelected person in the background.“Any victims I have spoken with during the whole legacy consultation were all very dubious about how it would really and truly deal with the past in a fair way and it is quite obvious that it won’t. If Sinn Fein can’t even respect a law that was made five years ago how on earth are we to trust them with the legacy issue ”Mr Allister was unavailable for comment, but a TUV spokesperson said Sinn Fein’s actions had “come as no surprise”.Accusing others at Stormont of facilitating Sinn Fein’s attempts to get round the law, the spokesman said: “It is clear that the law on special advisers was flouted left, right and centre.“All of this does nothing to increase confidence in politics. And it begs the question, does Northern Ireland really want to go back to such a fundamentally flawed system of government ”try catch     .               ..

Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling.Photo by Matt Mackey The evidence raises questions about how serious the DUP and Sinn Fein were at that point about really getting to the truth of the RHI scandal, a process which has ultimately led to damaging revelations about both parties.At the time when the RHI scandal became a crisis for Stormont, Mr Sterling was permanent secretary in the Department of Finance.Recalling that time he said that the Audit Office report which first publicly exposed the RHI scandal in July  “gave rise to relatively low media comment” and it was not until after the BBC Spotlight programme on December  that the issue became a crisis – and particularly “the subsequent focus by the BBC Nolan radio programme” which “gave rise to major concern within the Executive about the damage the fall-out from RHI was doing to the reputation of the Executive”.However, despite the public outcry and the revelation that a whistle-blower had personally approached Arlene Foster, the minister who established the scheme, Mr Sterling said that there was still “meaningful and constructive cooperation between Spads after the Spotlight programme and broad agreement that the Executive would need to try to regain some control of events”.He said: “During the week beginning December   consideration was being given to conducting a short, focused investigation by someone with expertise and independence, but short of a full public inquiry. “I was involved in a conference phone call with the head of the civil serviceon the morning of Thursday December  at which such an idea was being pursued. My recollection is that Hugh Widdis, [senior Sinn Fein aide] Aidan McAteer and [top DUP Spad] Timothy Johnston were with HOCS at the time. “I was tasked with trying to find a suitable independent person ideally with expertise on the energy sector.”Mr Sterling had been the top official in Mrs Foster’s department when RHI was set up and during its first few years, before moving to the finance department where he was again involved in closing RHI. For that reason, he is an important witness and when the public inquiry was later being established by his department Mr Sterling recused himself from that process.Mr Sterling said that it was Jonathan Bell’s remarkable televised interview with Stephen Nolan, followed by an interview with Mrs Foster, which “changed the dynamic” and by the following day “it became clear ... that Sinn Fein were fundamentally reappraising their approach”.Mr Sterling also spoke at someabout how the revelations of the inquiry have undermined public confidence in the civil service.He said: “The extent of the failings uncovered by the RHI Inquiry so far has, quite understandably, given rise to questions about the competence and capacity of the NI Civil Service to develop and deliver complex policy.”Ann Travers: IRA, not Sinn Fein, is at Stormont making decisionsRyan Macrae murder: People of Portaferry stunned at death Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"However, he said it would be “unjust to infer from the RHI scheme that all government policy-making, the administration of public funds and the delivery of public services in Northern Ireland is beset by the kinds of problems and issues that have arisen in the case of RHI”.He said he believed there was “a strong case for a review” of how Spads operate before anyto devolution.try catch     .               ..

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon.

I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice.

I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done. Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. The company said the dredging is necessary ahead of drilling that needs to be done ahead of works for the new reactors.       ,params: .pushEnvironmental watchdog Natural Resources Walesgranted the licence for the dumping and insist that it is safe.A spokesman for NRW said: ldquoEvery element of the application was considered thoroughly including testing of the sediment from the dredge sites by independent experts in accordance with international standards and guidelines, and advice from health experts. The results showed the material was suitable for disposal at sea.ldquoWersquove tried to reassure people that the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.EDF says the dredging of mud from the seabed off the Hinkley Point C site is necessary ahead of drilling six vertical shafts for the cooling water system for the new nuclear power station.However, those against the dredging say it could pose health risks.Max Wallis of Friends of the Earth, Penarth and Barry said: ldquoThe NRW up to recently stated the EIA for dumping had been covered in the EIA for the jetty development in Somerset, covered by the Environment Agency but this was contradicted by CEFASrsquos statement of , Nevertheless the NRWissued the  license.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done. Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. The company said the dredging is necessary ahead of drilling that needs to be done ahead of works for the new reactors.       ,params: .pushEnvironmental watchdog Natural Resources Walesgranted the licence for the dumping and insist that it is safe.A spokesman for NRW said: ldquoEvery element of the application was considered thoroughly including testing of the sediment from the dredge sites by independent experts in accordance with international standards and guidelines, and advice from health experts. The results showed the material was suitable for disposal at sea.ldquoWersquove tried to reassure people that the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.EDF says the dredging of mud from the seabed off the Hinkley Point C site is necessary ahead of drilling six vertical shafts for the cooling water system for the new nuclear power station.However, those against the dredging say it could pose health risks.Max Wallis of Friends of the Earth, Penarth and Barry said: ldquoThe NRW up to recently stated the EIA for dumping had been covered in the EIA for the jetty development in Somerset, covered by the Environment Agency but this was contradicted by CEFASrsquos statement of , Nevertheless the NRWissued the  license.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Rocket.jpg","title":"how to make a business rocket","story":"Posted on Wednesday  October  by Ulster Business How does a growing company help its expansion plans really take off  John Mulgrew takes a look at the options available to SMEs here when it comes to fundingWhat does a burgeoning small business do when it’s time to scale up There a numerous options for companies right across the business spectrum – and the options across the traditional banking world are plentul.But there’s additional assistance that can be garnered from less traditional sources, with feedback and support also coming from outside the conventional sphere.David Nelson, partner at KPMG private enterprise, a global professional services firm, says it “works with companies of all sizes and at every stage of their development -  from start-ups to established family businesses.”.“Our people understand what it takes for companies to be successful at every stage of development – from idea to exit – and will help them make the right decisions at every step of the way,” he said.“So the support we give to our clients ranges from business planning and raising capital through to help with expanding internationally, MA, tax advice, RD incentives, technical accounting matters and complying with regulatory requirements.”According to First Trust Bank’s head of business banking, Seamus McGuckin, there are “ious funding options available to assist SMEs as they grow”.“… be that asset finance, invoice discounting, revolving working capital, loan financing or overdraft facilities.“First and foremost, however the more important support we can offer our clients is our expertise and commitment to understanding their needs and then delivering a service to match. It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.
