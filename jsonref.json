The Chinese e-commerce titan Alibaba enjoyed record sales during its Singles Day shopping extravaganza, giving a much-needed boost to the firm after a torrid year in which it became the symbol of a government crackdown that hammered the country’s tech sector. The firm said 540.3bn yuan (£63bn) was spent as China’s army of consumers went on a splurge despite a more low-key sales campaign after pressure from the government to tone down the aggressive promotions and rampant consumerism. Combined sales with its industry rival JD came in at 889bn yuan, which was also a record and up about a fifth from last year. Alibaba and JD reported strong sales of items such as electric appliances, electronics, pet supplies, and cosmetics and other personal-care goods.

Richard Akers, chairman, will tell Redrow’s AGM today that: AstraZeneca has sold more than $2.2bn (£1.64bn) of its Covid-19 vaccine in the first nine months of this year, as the drugmaker said it is set to move to “modest profitability” as new orders are received. Britain’s biggest drugmaker has so far promised to provide the jab, which it developed with Oxford University, on a not-for-profit basis through the pandemic. “The company is now expecting to progressively transition the vaccine to modest profitability,” it said in its third-quarter results this morning. Earlier this week the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker confirmed it will create a vaccines unit as it plans for the future of its coronavirus shot beyond the pandemic. The company said the reorganisation would bring together people who had previously been based in different parts of the business, and will be dedicated to the Covid-19 vaccine and tweaked versions to deal with new variants of Sars-CoV-2. AstraZeneca said it intends to start including the revenue and profit of sales of the pandemic vaccine in its future financial guidance and in results on Friday there would be a “limited profit contribution” in the final three months of the year. The company said the contribution would offset costs relating to its long-acting antibody combination AZD7442, and has not changed its earnings guidance for investors.

Bank of England policymaker Catherine Mann warned that with significant numbers of workers returning to the office, those who stay away risk their careers suffering -- as a ‘two track’ workplace develops. While online communication is much better than before the pandemic, it still can’t replace the spontaneous office conversations which can lead to recognition and advancement in many workplaces, argued Mann, a member of the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee. Yesterday she told an event for women in finance hosted by the newspaper Financial News that: And with difficulties accessing childcare and Covid-related disruption to schooling continuing, Mann fears that this means many women will continue to work from home, while men returned to the office: The REC’s Neil Carberry says this is because shortages of key materials are hitting building sites, telling Today: The latest Construction PMI, released last week, showed that a “severe shortages of staff and materials” was hitting the sector. Carberry also plays down reports that Britain faces a Great Resignation, as workers quit in favour of a better job elsewhere. People are less worried about moving employers than earlier in the year, when there was more uncertainty, he explains, but... REC members say it’s taking at least a month longer to fill vacancies than normal, due to the tight labour market, Carberry told Radio 4’s Today programme. The 221,000 new job adverts posted last week shows there’s high demand for workers, he explained. And with a record 2.7m job openings, some vacancies are taking longer to fill. Are people being lured way to higher pay and bonuses? Carberry says this does happen over time. The increase in care home vacancies may be partly due to care workers being tempted to other sectors as the economy opens up. There’s also been “a big bounceback” in hospitality vacancies this year, as lockdown restrictions have lifted. We’re now in the key hiring season, with November and December particularly busy for the sector.Britain’s ongoing labour squeeze is continuing in the run up to Christmas, as firms continue to struggle to fill vacancies.  The number of active job postings at UK firms hit 2.68 million in the first week of November, a record high, according to the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) this morning.  Growth in job adverts shows “no signs of slowing down in the build up to Christmas”, REC says, despite concerns about increases in the cost of living and the persistent presence of COVID-19.  Another 221,000 ads were added during the week - the fourth highest weekly figure since the start of 2020. It highlights that the worker shortages that have hampered the UK’s recovery have not eased, as growth slows over the summer. These vacancies could give workers the upper hand in pay negotiations -- at a time when the cost of living squeeze is hitting families. Neil Carberry, chief executive of the REC, says: European stock markets are set for a flat open.  Yesterday, the FTSE 100 closed at a 20-month high, after strong results from AutoTrader, with mining giants lifted by relief that property developer China Evergrande averted a default.

We’re going to fight hard for the ambition in here, and to build on this text and fight for greater ambition, particularly on loss and damage.  “We will continue to champion 1.5, which is our coalition’s north star. Fossil fuel subsidies must end. We must double adaptation finance from current levels. Loss and damage is too central for us to settle for workshops. We must strengthen action on loss and damage. We need an article 6 resolution that results in real reductions. The zero-sum offsetting era must end.”The action was organised by activist theatre group BP or not BP? and New York performance activists Reverend Billy and the Stop Shopping Choir and is part of a growing movement in the UK that is demanding an end to fossil fuel sponsorship across cultural institutions. On the $100bn annual finance long promised by rich nations for clean energy development in poorer nations but never delivered in full, Tollmann said of the new draft text: “It’s a step up in the sense that we’ve not only acknowledged the shortfall in the $100bn, but we actually have a strong call to fully deliver it.” Loss and damage is extremely controversial at Cop. Vulnerable and poorer nations insist it is a moral duty as compensation for a climate crisis they largely did not cause. Rich nations are fearful of being held legally accountable for vast compensation. But adding “unabated” in relation to coal-fired power stations provides a loophole – James Murray at Business Green says it is calling the coal industries bluff, i.e. “if you can do carbon capture and storage, go ahead”. There are no major CCS plants to date. Adding “inefficient” as a qualifier for fossil fuel subsidies – $11m a minute according to the IMF – is a bigger loophole. But in my opinion, the fact the fossil fuel text remains is a bigger win than the caveats are a loss.  Here’s the take of the Australia Institute’s Richie Merzian – a former COP negotiator: “Fortunately, we still have some reference to getting rid of fossil fuel subsidies, and we have some reference to coal. That’s good. So let’s start there. Many expected there to be strong push back and for that to leave completely. But having said that, there have been multiple caveats placed on that - enough that you could run a coal train through it.”The climate group says the new text would give the go ahead to “entrenching carbon offsetting, which opens up major loopholes for double counting of emissions that risks blowing the 1.5C limit by offering a way out of real emissions reductions.” Louisa Casson, climate campaigner at Greenpeace UK, added: "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab18bf35c5d88dd6e053db0786ed7db733fa0d19/0_274_4800_2881/master/4800.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=23deab5d6025382514e1b5fe5e6a5f7c","title":"covid news live austria to restrict unvaccinated in north province the netherlands considers new partial lockdown","story":"The government will hold a video call with the governors of Austria’s nine provinces on Sunday at which the aim is to agree on the measure in response to a surge in infections, he told a news conference in the western province of Tyrol.

He said: Mauritius had fully opened its doors to international visitors at the start of October, hoping to rebuild its vital tourism industry after months of isolation because of the pandemic.

Video: Enda O\u0027DowdIn a highly significant move at Cop26 an alliance of countries has committed to phasing out production of oil and gas – and is to push for an international agreement on setting an end date for the exploration and extraction of the fossil fuels.The launch of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA), which Ireland has joined, is a first in an international climate process which up to now has focused on limiting carbon emissions from fossil fuels rather than turning off the tap. The 2015 Paris Agreement did not even mention fossil fuels, which generated 91 per cent of human-induced carbon emissions in 2020.The alliance is seeking to curtail new licensing and undertake other measures to phase out oil and gas production in line with the Paris accord. Ireland joined Costa Rica Denmark, France, Greenland, Quebec, Sweden, Wales, California and New Zealand in making the milestone announcement.Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan said: “Ireland is leading the way in incentivising the transition to renewable energy and putting ourselves on a pathway to net zero, by legislating to keep fossil fuels in the ground. The decision we have made today sends a powerful message we are moving irrevocably away from fossil fuels towards a renewable future - both in Ireland and internationally.”“Through the Climate Act 2021, Ireland has closed the door on new exploration activities for oil and gas. There is no longer a legal basis for granting new licences,” he underlined. In line with Government policy of keeping fossil fuels in the ground, “we are also currently legislating to prohibit exploration for and extraction of coal, lignite and oil shale”, Mr Ryan confirmed. Founding members “committing to end new concessions, licensing or leasing rounds, and promoting dialogue on the need for a managed and just phase-out”. Mr Ryan added: “By prohibiting offshore oil and gas exploration, not only are we doing what we need to do to address climate change, we are also protecting our bioersity which is intrinsically linked to climate change. There are other impacts. For example, scientific research demonstrates that the seismic activity that accompanies exploration and drilling has significant environmental effects.”No futureDenmark and Costa Rica led the initiative. Denmark’s minister for climate, energy, and utilities Dan Jorgensen said that it was expensive for his country as it was the largest producer of oil in the EU but “we do it because we believe we need to”.“There’s no future for oil and gas in a 1.5-degree world,” he added.Costa Rica’s environment minister Andrea Meza said the alliance was about early movers showing courage, “backed by concrete actions”.“It’s a big deal,” said Harro van Assel of Stockholm Environment Institute. “It’s the first time governments are committing together to phase down oil and gas production.”Jerry Mac Evilly, head of polity at Friends of the Earth Ireland said Ireland’s participation in BOGA was hugely positive. “Ireland has taken important steps in recent years to phase out fossil fuels, from ending new oil and gas exploration, to banning onshore fracking. However with the new alliance we are now finally seeing domestic progress being reflected in foreign policy.” He added: “The fossil fuel era must be brought to an end and this means leaving fossil fuels in the ground. This new alliance is an opportunity for Ireland to show leadership and end the reckless expansion of oil and gas at home and abroad.”Meanwhile the Government has also announced €2 million to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition which aims at cutting short-lived pollutants including methane and to reduce air pollution – an initiative that has been led by US climate envoy John Kerry.

Video: Enda O\u0027DowdClimate activists and delegates take part in a demonstration on Thursday ahead of a plenary session during the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. Photograph: Paul EllisAFP via GettyA new draft of the deal that could be agreed at the Glasgow Cop26 climate talks appears to have watered down its push to curb fossil fuels.The first draft of the “cover decision” for the overarching agreement at the summit called for countries “to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels”.In a new draft produced on Friday morning, that has changed to calling on countries to accelerate the shift to clean energy systems, “including by rapidly scaling up clean power generation and accelerating the phase-out of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels”.The inclusion of a reference to fossil fuels was a first for a United Nations decision document of this type but was expected to get fierce pushback from some countries – and still may not survive to the final text.Talks went on through the night and look set to over-run from their finish time of Friday evening as negotiators come under pressure to resolve issues around finance for poor countries, fossil fuels, the efforts of countries to cut emissions in the 2020s and rules on carbon markets and transparency.The latest draft appears to have strengthened language on getting countries to “revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets” in their national action plans by the end of 2022 to align with global goals to limit temperature rises to “well below” two degrees and try to limit them to 1.5 degrees.The new version “requests” countries do so, compared with the previous version which “urges” them to do so.Michael Jacobs, former climate adviser to Gordon Brown and veteran of Cop talks, said UK, European Union and UNFCCC lawyers were saying that “requests” was stronger language than “urges”.He said: “I see this as a strengthening of the language which effectively means countries are being told to come back next year with nationally determined contributions aligned to the 1.5-degrees temperature goal.”Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5 degrees – beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt – requires global emissions to be cut by 45 per cent by 2030, and to zero overall by mid-century.But current action plans, known as nationally determined contributions, for emissions cuts up to 2030 leave the world well off track to meet the goal, and could see warming of 2.4 degrees over the long term.So countries are under pressure to rapidly increase their ambition for emission cuts in the 2020s to stop the 1.5-degrees goal slipping out of reach.There is now a date – missing from the first draft – for when developed countries should double the provision of finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change – by 2025.Providing finance for developing countries to develop cleanly, adapt to the impacts of climate change and address the loss and damage to people, livelihoods, land and infrastructure already being hit by increasing weather extremes and rising seas is also key to securing a deal in Glasgow.‘Inching forward’First minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon said she has not had a chance to properly absorb the new draft but, from what she has seen, she would describe it as “inching forward”, adding that there is time to improve it.Ms Sturgeon said there has been some “incremental progress”, telling Sky News: “If I was a young person looking into this summit right now I would say it’s not good enough.“There may have been inches forward in this latest draft but there’s still time to get it even further forward and to really make the Glasgow Agreement one that lives up to the urgency of the emergency we face.”Asked if she was calling for Boris Johnson to come to Glasgow, Ms Sturgeon said: “If that is what it is going to take, then yes. He was here on Wednesday, I welcomed that. In his shoes, I may have stayed here for the remainder of the summit, but come back . . . every shoulder to the wheel.“I’m not in the negotiating room. That can feel frustrating sometimes. But get there, and make sure that no stone is left unturned in getting this agreement to where it needs to be.”Ms Sturgeon said she would not bet on Friday being the last day of Cop26.“I certainly hope that finishing at six o’clock tonight, which is the plan, would be possible,” she told Sky News. “Equally, I would not be surprised to know that it was going into tomorrow. That’s not unusual at Cop, so nobody should read anything particular into that if it does happen.” – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Of some 240 known wetland species, almost 70 have been listed for Red List protectionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"plan to deliver paris climate goals could be agreed this week cop26 hears","story":"Frans Timmermans, Vice-President of the European Commission, said it would be a ‘very bad signal’ if a reference to phasing out coal and fossil fuels in a draft text published on Wednesday does not survive in the summit’s final statement. Photograph: Robert PerryEPAThe rulebook for implementing the 2015 Paris climate agreement could be completed at the Cop26 in Glasgow this week, European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans has said.He said completing the rulebook, which sets out detailed guidance for how countries must implement the goals agreed in Paris in 2015, would be one of the key outcomes of this week’s summit. “It will allow us to start delivery of what was agreed six years ago in a way that is transparent for everyone and accountable for everyone,” he told a press conference in Glasgow. “I think there is a positive dynamic, and I see a growing sense among fellow leaders that we need to find agreement. We in the European Union continue to work to keep the momentum going and hopefully drive it to the highest possible level of ambition.” Most of the rulebook has been agreed since 2018 but a number of key issues remain unresolved, notably on the regulation of carbon markets where emissions are traded. Completing the rulebook would be a major success for Cop26, which is due to end by 6pm on Friday but Mr Timmermans warned it would be a “very bad signal” if a reference to phasing out coal and fossil fuels in a draft text published on Wednesday does not survive in the summit’s final statement . “It took the world a while to understand. I remember even some of our member-states only a couple of years ago saying coal is forever. And now every member state of European Union knows that there is no future in coal. “I think the sense of urgency has increased and the understanding that fossil fuels are part of the problem has increased. But if you remove it from the text, what is the message you’re sending then? Because the only way humanity can learn to live within planetary boundaries is if we rid ourselves of the dependency on fossil fuels that are making our survival impossible,” he said. The EU has faced charges of hypocrisy over its investment in dozens of gas infrastructure projects at the same time that it is calling in Glasgow for an end to fossil fuels. But Mr Timmermans said the EU had nothing to be ashamed of and asserted that its investment in gas infrastructure helped to prepare for a future beyond fossil fuels. “Exiting out of coal for a number of our member-states will have to happen through an intermediary phase of using natural gas to lead these countries to using fossil-free energy. That is reality. “Now, what we need to do with our investments is to make sure that the investments in the infrastructure that will be needed for natural gas are pre-fitted to also be able to carry decarbonated or green gases so that the density of different gases can be transported through this infrastructure,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"young voices among the excluded at cop26 claims irish activist","story":"Extinction Rebellion members protest outside the main Cop26 entrance in Glasgow.

She added: “Is it charity or reparation that we are talking out?”To solve the climate crisis was not just about cutting greenhouse gases, she said. “It must be while changing the system that created the problem in the first place.” The Irish activists had an hour-long meeting with Minister for Climate Action Eamon Ryan in Glasgow, where she said the exclusion issue was highlighted, whereby young people could not get into the negotiation room or hear what was going on.Ms Molay said it was emotional for her hearing from people at the meeting talking about themselves and how overwhelming the climate issue was, as indicated by one person saying, “I started this at 13, now I’m going to college, I can’t continue doing this”.“They are sick and tired of assemblies and then nothing happens after that,” she noted.‘At home in Ireland’She welcomed a commitment by Mr Ryan to raise the issue of appropriate language with lead negotiators on loss and damage and his undertaking to examine how youth engagement can be improved “at home in Ireland”.The young climate activists met chairwoman of the Elders Mary Robinson at the conclusion the meeting. The former president said she was glad to have met them as well as other young people form every continent during Cop26.“Every single one them said they’re so tired they’re exhausted. We talked about their self-care,” said Mrs Robinson. Others must prove this is not the case, she insisted. Mrs Robinson introduced the Irish group to former UK prime minister Gordon Brown who was at Cop26 to make a “final push” for countries to agree on $100 billion (€87 billion) a year for poorer countries to tackle change, to avoid the summit being branded a failure. He compared the current system of trying to secure the long-promised climate finance annually for developing countries to “a charity fundraiser or a begging bowl going around the table”."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus infections surge by more than 50 in a week","story":"Many parts of the country now have 14-day incidence rates of more than 1,000 per 100,000. File photograph: The  Covid-19 cases have surged by 57 per cent in the last week with the number of hot spots for the virus growing all the time. The 14-day incidence rate nationwide increased from 587 cases per 100,000 last week to 924 per 100,000 this week, according to the figures produced by the Health Surveillance Protection Centre. Many parts of the country now have 14-day incidence rates of more than 1,000 per 100,000 – meaning that at least 1 per cent of the population in that area has tested positive in the last fortnight. The surge in case numbers has prompted the Department of Public Health Mid-West to advise people living in Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary to limit their movements. In the previous 14 days up to November 8th there were 3,374 cases in the area, 1,810 in Limerick, 1,027 in Clare and 546 in north Tipperary. It blamed rising numbers on “pre-pandemic levels of social activity”. Director of public health Mid West Mal Mannix said it anticipated a “considerable increase in Covid-19 cases should social activity remain at its current rate”. Shannon (1,029.7 per 100,000) and Killaloe (1,000 per 100,000) in Co Clare, Adare (1,140.4 per 100,000) and Limerick City East (1,001.6) in Limerick, and Nenagh (1,300.7 per 100,000) in north Tipperary are all local electoral areas (LEA) with 14 day incidence rates above 1,000 per 100,000 of the population. Carndonagh in Co Donegal, is the worst affected LEA in the country with a rate of 1,992.5 per 100,000. Manorhamilton in Co Leitrim is the second worst affected incidence rate of 1,811.3 per 100,000. All three LEAs in Leitrim now have rates of more than 1,000 per 100,000 of the population. Leitrim is one of 11 counties above that threshold, the others being Waterford, Carlow, Louth, Laois, Longford, Meath, Westmeath, Donegal, Cork and Kerry. Leitrim (1,426.2 per 100,000), Waterford (1,037.5 per 100,000) and Carlow (1,185.6 per 100,000) are now the worst-affected counties in the State. Cahir in Co Tipperary (1,556 per 100,000), Lismore in Co Waterford (1,529.3 per 100,000) and Drogheda in Co Louth (1,504.8 per 100,000) have rates of more than 1,500 per 100,000. Cork cityThe whole of Cork city along with Macroom, Mallow, Fermoy, and Cobh have rates above 1,000 per 100,000 as does most of the north and west Co Dublin.The LEA with the lowest level of Covid-19 in the country remains Belmullet in Co Mayo which had an 14-day incidence rate of 198.4 per 100,000. The area was hit hardest during the January surge with 1,000 cases in a three-week period. Paul Moynagh, professor of immunology at Maynooth University, said the high prevalence in Belmullet last January generated “significant levels of immunity from natural infection” and this was likely even an underestimate given that not all infections are detected.The opposite impact is being felt in counties including Leitrim Waterford and Kerry which were largely spared in January but now have some of the highest rates countrywide.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid pass required for nursing home visitors from monday","story":"Visitors to residential care facilities must have proof of vaccination, such as the EU Covid cert or the HSE vaccination card, or have other proof of immunity, such as through prior infection. Photograph: iStock Visitors to nursing homes will be required to show proof of vaccination or immunity against Covid-19, under new guidance that comes into effect on Monday.According to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), residents in nursing homes and other long-term residential care facilities have a right to maintain “meaningful relationships” with people, and visiting is an important part of that.In order to support the continued visitation, the HPSC updated its guidance, called Normalising Visiting in Long-term Residential Care Facilities.Under the new advice, prospective visitors must have proof of vaccination, such as the European Union Covid cert or the Health Service Executive (HSE) vaccination card, or have other proof of immunity, such as through prior infection.For regular visitors, this needs to be checked only once and does not need to be rechecked at every visit.There is also a provision for exemptions on compassionate grounds, which is not limited to when the death of a resident is imminent.Compassionate and critical events also include when a resident becomes particularly distressed, when there is an important life event such as a resident’s birthday or when the resident expresses a “strong sense of need” to see someone, according to the HPSC.The new advice comes into effect from Monday.On November 4th, the Department of Health informed the HSE that the Minister for Health approved a decision that the visitation guidance to these facilities include this requirement.The stance was supported by the chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan, whose previous correspondence said the National Public Health Emergency Team strongly recommends the adoption of the Covid-19 pass for visitation.GuidanceThe HPSC guidance states that a visitor who is fully vaccinated or has immunity as a result of prior infection is “far less likely” to acquire severe Covid-19 disease as a result of exposure to the virus.There is evidence that people who are fully vaccinated are also likely to shed virus for a shorter period of time if they do become infected, the HPSC added. However, people with symptoms of Covid-19 or other viral respiratory tract infection should be asked not to visit regardless of their vaccination status or level of immunity.Influenza vaccination for residents, healthcare workers and eligible visitors is also recommended and helps to protect residents from introduction and spread of influenza virus, the guide added. “The measures recommended will also reduce the risk of introduction and spread of other viral infections including influenza,” the report states.Some of the other key points in the guidance include the requirement to ensure window visits and remote visits such as phone and video calls can continue at all times.It also highlights that the term “visitor” does not extend to essential service providers, which include those providing healthcare, legal, financial, advocacy and regulatory services, The document states that essential service providers should be fully vaccinated, which is similar to healthcare workers, but recommends that they cannot be denied access.Care Champions, an advocacy group supporting the rights of residents in nursing homes, said there must be consequences for centres that do not comply with the new guidelines.Sarah Lennon, executive director of Sage, the national organisation that supports older and vulnerable adults, said visits from friends and family are vitally important.“We know from our advocacy work that some nursing home residents and their families continue to experience issues in relation to how some nursing home providers are facilitating visiting,” Ms Lennon said. She added that if there is no return to previous open door policy, then the Government must move “legally to protect” the rights of nursing home residents to have visitors.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"more than 6 000 children tested positive for covid in first week of november","story":"There is one child with Covid being treated in Crumlin’s children’s hospital as well as another in Temple Street hospital. Photograph: iStock More than 6,000 children and teenagers tested positive for Covid-19 in the first week of November, the latest figures from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) have shown.There were 978 confirmed cases in the up-to-four age group, 3,394 cases in the five-12 age group and 1,658 in the 13-18 age group.Cases in five- to 12-year-olds represented 14 per cent of all cases between October 31st and November 6th.A 14-year-old died as a result of Covid-19 in the week between November 3rd and 9th, the youngest person in the State to die with the virus. The teenager was one of 25 people who died from Covid-19 in that week.No details about the 14-year-old have been provided by the HPSC or the Health Service Executive (HSE). The teenager was one of six people under the age of 25 to have died in the State from Covid-19 during the pandemic to date.Since the beginning of the pandemic, 369 babies and children (aged up to four years) have had to be treated in hospital for the virus as well as 273 children aged between five and 14 years, according to the State’s Covid-19 data hub. Eilísh Hardiman, the chief executive of Children’s Health Ireland, has warned that double the number of babies are expected to contract respiratory illnesses this winter.Speaking on RTÉ Radio’s Today with Claire Byrne programme, Ms Hardiman said that last year there were no RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) cases among children because of lockdown but that it was anticipated that the cases would double this year because babies had not built up immunity.“There will be a double whammy, a second wave,” she said.The system was already under severe pressure, especially in emergency departments at children’s hospitals, Ms Hardiman said, adding this meant elective procedures were being cancelled.The number of attendances at children’s emergency departments during October 2019 was 11,700, she said, but in October this year that figure rose to 19,845. “That is a massive increase.”Although there had never been more than single-figure cases of Covid among children hospitalised, restrictions and therefore delays occurred because their parents could catch Covid, she said.“We have a capacity issue. All our beds are full at the moment because of the need for respiratory care,” she said, adding that waiting lists had deteriorated. “We will never have a zero waiting list.”More resourcesMs Hardiman said investment was needed as well as extra beds and staff. She said CHI had plans ready to go once investment was received but that it would still be 2½ years before the new children’s hospital was completed. She pointed out the Temple Street hospital building was 182 years old.CHI was not happy about waiting lists for children, and access to care was its priority, she said, adding: “But we cannot magic up facilities.”CHI had to plan ahead to identify bottlenecks, but in the meantime it had to deal with the constraints, which “we’re trying to address”, she said.“The system is under pressure, we need new resources and new plans. We’ve outlined what we can do.”The latest HSE figures showed there were 528 people in hospital with Covid-19 on Thursday night, with 96 of those in intensive care. The Mater hospital in Dublin has the highest number of Covid-19 patients with 57, followed by St James’s hospital (49) and Beaumont hospital (43).There is one child with the virus being treated in Crumlin’s children’s hospital as well as another being cared for in Temple Street hospital. No children are being treated for the virus in Tallaght children’s hospital. A further 3,680 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in the State on Thursday.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"leitrim rents driven up by people leaving cities during pandemic","story":"Auctioneer Liam Farrell at an apartment for rent in Carrick-on-Shannon. Photograph: Brian Farrell A shortage of rental properties in Co Leitrim has meant that many young adults who fled from higher rents in cities during the Covid-19 lockdowns are still living with their parents a year on, local politicians say. Rents in the county have risen at one of the sharpest rates in the State, with the latest Daft.ie report indicating they are up 21.6 per cent since the third quarter of last year, to an average of €742. The lack of available accommodation is such, according to Cllr Enda Stenson, that if the former MBNA plant in Carrick-on-Shannon, currently on the market at €6.6 million, was to be bought by a major employer, it would struggle for staff who could find places to live. “If a big US company came in and wanted to create hundreds of jobs we just don’t have the accommodation,” he said, adding that many natives who returned to the county during the pandemic were having similar problems.“A lot came home and a lot are still working from home, but it is their mother and father’s home. I personally know 10 people in that situation who are living with their parents because they have no other option.”Estate agent Liam Farrell said the average rents cited in the Daft report seemed quite low given what he was seeing in places such as Carrick-on-Shannon. “We are quoting €1,490 for a five-bedroom house in Carrick at the moment in a very good location,” he said, adding that a similar property would have commanded €1,250 to €1,300 per month a year ago. He attributed the rent increases to Leitrim people returning to the county as they wanted to be nearer family during the pandemic and also to greater interest from abroad. “There is no question about it, Covid and the ability to work from home has had an impact on demand,” he said. “People reassessed their lives during the first lockdown and, as we have seen, people flee cities like London and Paris as well as Dublin.”He said people questioned why they should continue to cover “silly rents in Dublin” given remote working had become an option and they could pay €750 or €800 a month “for a waterside penthouse apartment in Leitrim”. Mr Farrell said his office was receiving a couple of inquiries from people based in Germany every week, which had not happened before in his two decades in the business.Tax breaksSligo-based estate agent John Murphy, who rents properties in Tubbercurry as well as in Sligo town, said while tax breaks in rural towns in the region meant there was plenty of availability 10 years ago, this was no longer the case. “People were buying second properties as an investment and renting them out in places like Tubbercurry because they weren’t paying tax on them, but that has all changed,” he said. Mr Murphy said a property he would have let for €350 a month three years ago in Tubbercurry now cost €600, with a lack of supply the key price driver.Sinéad Walsh, rental manager with Oates Breheny Group in Sligo, questioned how rents could have increased by, for example, 18.4 per cent for a two-bed house in the county given prices are meant to be capped in Sligo town and Strandhill, which are rent pressure zones (RPZs). She said villages outside the RPZs such as Ballisodare and Enniscrone were currently highly sought-after areas. Ronan Lyons, associate professor in economics at Trinity College Dublin and an author of the Daft.ie report, said RPZs in reality did not give much protection in such places, as people were probably not in a position to challenge landlords on prices given the lack of availability. He noted that rents had risen from a low base in counties such as Leitrim and Sligo and that while these “seemed very attractive “ to people used to city prices, the increases were considerable for people who have been living in the county throughout and “seen rents double over 10 years”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 pressure builds on eu to get climate deal over the line","story":"In the penultimate day of Cop26 nerves are rising among activists and delegates at what will be left in or out of the final document.  Video: Enda O\u0027DowdEnvironmental protesters demonstrate outside the offices of JP Morgan in Glasgow during the Cop26 summit. Photograph:  Andrew MilliganPA The Cop26 summit is facing into tortuous final hours as negotiators attempt to strengthen a declaration and add greater urgency in the global response to the climate crisis – with most pressure on the EU to get it across the line.With 197 countries locked in negotiations over a second version of a draft agreement, a flurry of small protests were staged inside the Cop26 venue, at its periphery and throughout the city. Activists deflated the tyres of about 60 4X4s in the city’s west end in protest at the cars’ high levels of emissions.Announcements made in Glasgow “on forests, methane, clean technology and more” were encouraging, Mr Guterres said. “But they are far from enough. The emissions gap remains a devastating threat. The finance and adaptation gap represents a glaring injustice for the developing world.” “Promises ring hollow when the fossil fuels industry still receives trillions as measured by the IMF,” he added, “Or when countries are still building coal plants. Governments need to pick up the pace and show the necessary ambition – we cannot settle for the lowest common denominator.” ‘Vulnerable countries’If the EU does not lead and build the high-ambition coalition needed, no one else will, the independent European climate think tank E3G said on Thursday night. “There is an immediate opportunity for the EU to leverage the political momentum from week one and the US-China statement to build the confidence that the trillions will be mobilised for developing and vulnerable countries for the net-zero and climate-resilient transformation we need.” Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Australia were reported to be resisting efforts to strengthen emission-reduction requirements, while vulnerable countries were seeking more robust commitments on adaptation, loss and damage and climate finance and going beyond the issue of delivering on $100 billion a year, to include “mobilising the trillions through the whole global financial architecture”, it added. European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans said removing a text reference on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies would be an extremely bad signal – a view strongly echoed by Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan. “If you remove it from the text, what is the message you are sending there? Because the only way humanity can learn to live within planetary boundaries is if we rid ourselves of dependency on fossil fuels that are making our survival impossible,” Mr Timmermans added.‘Close to abyss’He said the rulebook for implementing the Paris climate agreement could be completed at Cop26. Agreeing the rulebook, which sets out detailed guidance for how countries must implement goals agreed in Paris in 2015, would be one of the key outcomes of the summit. “It will allow us to start delivery of what was agreed six years ago in a way that is transparent for everyone and accountable for everyone,” he said.Mr Ryan, who is negotiating on behalf of the EU, said at a briefing the climate finance issue might be the last item to get across the line, with expectation that Cop26 will run into the weekend. He confirmed Mr Guterres attended an EU coordination meeting and underlined “when you are close to the abyss, your next step is important”.Irish climate activist and director of FaithInvest Lorna Gold believed the emotional intervention on Thursday by chair of the Elders Mary Robinson “really changed the tone”. “Leading now requires vulnerability cutting through the ‘blah’. Naming what’s at stake. This is under our watch. I think today governments see that now is the time to choose what side of history they want to be on,” she added."},{"url":null,"title":"dublin seeks to ease brexit tensions as talks resume in london","story":"The European Union’s negotiator Maros Sefcovic will be in London for talks with his UK counterpart  David Frost.

But the UK is insisting that the protocol needs a more fundamental redrafting including the removal of the European Court of Justice from its role as arbiter of EU law.“We think that the objectives set out by the UK are unattainable,” said a senior EU official. “The UK position is that the role of the EU’s institution needs to go... As long as that remains the UK position, I don’t see what we can do.” – Additional reporting:  How is Brexit affecting you?

The new wave of infections in the Netherlands has put pressure on hospitals, forcing them to scale back regular care. Photograph: Sem van der WalANPAFP via GettyThe Netherlands will impose western Europe’s first partial lockdown since the summer this weekend, in a bid to stop a surge in Covid-19 cases, Dutch broadcaster NOS said on Friday.Bars, restaurants and non-essential stores will be ordered to close at 7pm for at least three weeks starting on Saturday, NOS said, citing government sources.People will be urged to work from home as much as possible, and no audiences will be allowed at sporting events in the coming weeks. Schools, theatres and cinemas would remain open.Caretaker prime minister Mark Rutte’s cabinet will take a final decision later on Friday, and will announce the new measures during a televised press conference scheduled for 6pm.New coronavirus infections in the country of 17.5 million have increased rapidly after social distancing measures were dropped late September and hit a record of about 16,300 in 24 hours on Thursday.The new wave of infections has put pressure on hospitals throughout the country, forcing them to scale back regular care again to treat Covid-19 patients.To contain the outbreak, the government’s pandemic advisory panel on Thursday recommended imposing a partial lockdown and to limit entrance to public places to people who have been fully vaccinated or have recently recovered from a coronavirus infection.A new lockdown would mean a drastic turn in policy for the Dutch government, which until last month thought that a relatively high vaccination rate would mean it could further ease measures towards the end of the year.AustriaBut it is not alone in considering strict measures as infections spike to record levels. Austria on Thursday said it was days away from placing millions of unvaccinated people in lockdown.People who are unvaccinated in Austria – about 35 per cent of the population – are already banned from going to hair salons, restaurants, cinemas and ski lifts.Many developed countries, however, are sticking to the view that vaccine rollouts mean lockdowns are unnecessary, with Britain, for instance, relying on booster shots to increase immunity. A booster campaign is also under way in Ireland, with shots being offered to people aged over 60 and frontline healthcare workers.About 85 per cent of the adult Dutch population has been fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Booster shots have so far only been provided to a small group of people with weak immune systems, and will be offered to people aged 80 years and older in December.Last month, about 55 per cent of patients in Dutch hospitals and 70 per cent of those in intensive care were unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated, data provided by the Netherlands’ Institute for Health showed. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Energy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"article 16 loses power as uk negotiating tool as eu hardens approach","story":"Britain’s Brexit minister  David Frost: Europe has made it clear it is not impressed by British spin about triggering article 16 in a “calibrated and forensic” way.

The most liberal city in the world. Tourists flow down its bicycle lanes and canals looking for a taste of the cannabis and sexual freedom that mark the Netherlands’ permissive approach to government. The Dutch brand of liberalism is not limited to social issues – a love of free markets goes back centuries, to their days as a world power in trade and finance.So at first glance it might seem surprising that the first call for lockdown of the post-vaccine age (at least in Western Europe) should come out of the Netherlands. The country’s official “Outbreak Management Team” has recommended the reimposition of restrictions to combat a dramatic rise in case rates. The next set of measures could include cancelling events, closing theatres and cinemas and reintroducing curfews, on top of the mask mandate and “green pass” certification system they have already introduced.Welcome to the new liberal paradise, friends: enjoy your marijuana cookie, but masked, socially distanced, not after 8pm, and not without your state-approved paperwork.It’s one of the paradoxes of the Covid era that political scientists will no doubt be arguing about for decades: why have the most nominally liberal governments consistently reached for the most illiberal interventions?Look closer, and perhaps it shouldn’t surprise us. The Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte took office in the same year as David Cameron, on a similar political platform that combined social and market liberalism. In this they were both heirs to Blair. (Unlike Cameron, Rutte is still in power, but it’s no accident that the last remaining true Cameroon Tories such as Matt Hancock and Jeremy Hunt have been among the most enamoured with lockdowns).This type of politician has always tended towards technocracy. If you believe that the “big values” questions over how society and the economy should be run have all been answered, what’s left is a narrow competition over who can better manage the execution. Measurement, efficiency and “smart” political techniques become the central project politics becomes a science.In this mindset Covid is just another neat policy problem: a single end goal (to minimise cases, hospitalisations and deaths) which can be tracked and forecast in thousands upon thousands of charts and complex models, all backed by the easy virtue of saving lives. Just another case study at Harvard Business School or Sciences-Po.Ideals that don’t show up on these charts – quality of life, for example, or the sacred importance of children playing unencumbered with their friends – become easy to dismiss as pie-in-the-sky, or even dangerous. The status of freedom itself gets diminished. Self-described liberals end up with something approaching scorn for a value that they increasingly see as the kooky obsession of backbench Tory MPs and cranks.That is why the coming winter matters so much. As the first following the vaccine rollout, what happens next will create a precedent for years to come. Having successfully offered the vaccine to everyone who wants it, and even followed up with booster shots, most Western governments have now done everything they can short of long-term curtailments to the freedom of their societies.Many European countries have already crossed the Rubicon – Italy’s draconian vaccine passports are seeing workers banned from offices and students from universities, and the massive street protests each weekend showcase their bitterly isive effect. The UK (or England, to be precise, as both Scotland and Wales are already going further) now stands almost alone, alongside the Scandinavian countries, in resisting this step change to the way we live.That we are in this position has more to do with luck than heroism. The UK’s latest case wave started before most of Europe, because we vaccinated earlier and so encountered the drop-off in immunity earlier. And the chance replacement of Hancock with Sajid Javid seems to have shifted the attitude inside Government just in time.For now, there are reasons to be hopeful: cases in England are trending down, even as cases across Europe are shooting up. If we can show that living with Covid can be done without destroying our free society, we will have done the world a profound service and might even reacquaint lost liberals with the value of liberty.More from NewsPilot who organised doomed Emiliano Sala flight jailed for 18 monthsMyanmar jails American journalist Danny Fenster jailed for 11 yearsRussia sending paratroopers to Belarus-Poland borderThanksgiving 2021: pies, parades, presidential pardons and the history behind the dayWinter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 deal watered overnight wording key fossil fuel pledge","story":"A key pledge in the Cop26 deal on phasing out fossil fuels has been watered down in the latest draft, released hours before the summit is due to end.The first draft of the final agreement, which will decide whether the Glasgow summit has been a success, included a line calling for the accelerated phase out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. The latest draft instead refers to “unabated coal power” and “inefficient subsidies”, which are understood to mean direct assistance for the extraction of fossil fuels, rather than state funds for household fuel poverty, such as the UK’s Warm Homes Discount. You can see the changes below. Unabated coal means power plants without technology attached that can capture the emissions and store them. The new draft was released after a long night of negotiations, and with many issues left to resolve it is now almost certain that talks will pass the official deadline of 6pm Friday. Negotiators were not expecting the pledge on coal and fossil fuels to make it into the final text, so its inclusion in the second draft has been taken as a positive sign. The wording matches similar language used by the G20.If it makes it to the final text, it would be the first time that fossil fuels have been explicitly mentioned in a final agreement at the annual climate summit. But activists say the language has been “critically weakened”, leaving it open to interpretation by major polluters. Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan said: “It could be better, it should be better, and we have one day left to make it a lot, lot better.Right now the fingerprints of fossil fuel interests are still on the text and this is not the breakthrough deal that people hoped for in Glasgow.“The key line on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies has been critically weakened, but it’s still there and needs to be strengthened again before this summit closes.”A line that “urged” countries to resubmit new plans to cut their emissions as soon as next year has been changed to a “request”, which the UN says is stronger language in an official document. The UN says “urging” is the strongest language for a call in an official document such as this, but negotiators believe requests is strong enough to make countries return.Getting major polluters to come back with new plans next year for emissions cuts before 2030 is seen as the best hope for achieving the summit’s aim to keep warming to 1.5C. Analysts say we are on track for more like 2.4C of warming on the basis of current 2030 emissions cut promises. First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon has said she would not bet on Friday being the last day of Cop26.Asked if Friday is the last day of the summit, she told Sky News: I wouldn\u0027t bet lots of money on that. I hope we see progress today.I certainly hope that finishing at six o\u0027clock tonight, which is the plan, would be possible.Equally, I would not be surprised to know that it was going into tomorrow. That\u0027s not unusual at Cop, so nobody should read anything particular into that if it does happen.Nicola Sturgeon said she has not had a chance to properly absorb the new draft of the deal that could be agreed at Cop26 but that, from what she has seen, she would describe it as inching forward, adding that there is time to improve it.Scotland\u0027s First Minister said there has been some incremental progress, telling Sky News: If I was a young person looking into this summit right now I would say it\u0027s not good enough.There may have been inches forward in this latest draft but there\u0027s still time to get it even further forward and to really make the Glasgow Agreement one that lives up to the urgency of the emergency we face.She added: In these final hours, the Prime Minister if necessary should come back here and drive this deal over the line.Asked if she was calling for Boris Johnson to come to Glasgow, Ms Sturgeon said: If that is what it is going to take, then yes. He was here on Wednesday, I welcomed that. In his shoes, I may have stayed here for the remainder of the summit, but come back... every shoulder to the wheel.I\u0027m not in the negotiating room. That can feel frustrating sometimes. But get there, and make sure that no stone is left unturned in getting this agreement to where it needs to be.Boris Johnson should return to Cop26 to push people on to a path where we avoid climate catastrophe, Nicola Sturgeon has said.Scotland\u0027s First Minister was speaking after a new draft agreement at the conference was published.She told BBC Breakfast: My message to the Prime Minister is come back here. Use your position as president of this Cop to really drive progress and push people as far as we can get them.Because every inch forward that this text takes is of course another inch towards getting the world on to a path where we avoid climate catastrophe, and nothing, literally nothing, is more important than that.She added: The reason I\u0027m singling out Boris Johnson is not just because we\u0027re in the UK - well, it is actually because we\u0027re in the UK, because the UK is the Cop presidency, and that puts a particular onus on the shoulders of the UK Government.More from NewsMyanmar jails American journalist Danny Fenster jailed for 11 yearsRussia sending paratroopers to Belarus-Poland borderThanksgiving 2021: pies, parades, presidential pardons and the history behind the dayWinter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?Leonid meteor shower 2021: when to see it peak, and other dates to watch out for in the UKMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prince charles closest aide michael fawcett resigns cash honours","story":"Prince Charles’s closest aide has stepped down from his role amid accusations that he helped to secure a knighthood for a donor to the Prince’s charity.Michael Fawcett, who has worked with Prince Charles for four decades, has left his position, Clarence House confirmed on Thursday night.Mr Fawcett began working for the Royal family in 1981, first as a junior footman to the Queen and then a personal valet to her eldest son. He rose through the ranks and in 2018 was made the chief executive of The Prince’s Foundation.Earlier this year, a letter from 2017 emerged in which Mr Fawcett allegedly told a Saudi billionaire who donated £1.5million to the Duke of Wales’s charity that he could help secure him an honour and citizenship.The letter allegedly written to Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfou said: In light of the ongoing and most recent generosity of His Excellency Sheikh Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, I am happy to confirm to you, in confidence, that we are willing and happy to support and contribute to the application for citizenship.“I can further confirm we are willing to make an application to increase His Excellency’s honour from Honorary CBE to that of KBE in accordance with Her Majesty’s Honours Committee.Mr Mahfouz, 51, who is listed as a supporter on The Prince\u0027s Foundation website, donated large sums to restoration projects of particular interest to Prince Charles, specifically Dumfries House and the Castle of Mey in Scotland.In 2016, he was awarded an honorary CBE by the Prince at a private ceremony at Buckingham Palace.Sources close to the Prince have always strenuously denied that he was aware of any link between donations to his charity and honours.After the allegations emerged Mr Fawcett temporarily stepped down from his role pending a full investigation by the Prince’s Foundation.

An analysis of Electoral Commission records shows donations stretching back to  linking the party with oil and gas magnates.It comes as consumers are braced for massive hikes in their energy bills and as the PM attempts to lead efforts for the world to tackle climate change at the COP summit, while facing a flurry of sleaze claims levelled at his MPs since the resignation of Owen Paterson. Have your say on these donations in the comment section Anneliese Dodds, chairwoman of the Labour Party, told the Mirror: “Boris Johnson needs to show some leadership and put an end to the sleaze running rampant through his party and the cash-for-access culture at the heart of his Government.“Conservative MPs pocketing millions from vested interests can’t be acting in the national interest. It’s not a good look for the Prime Minister to claim commitment on moving past fossil fuels, but at the same time his own party is swimming in oil and gas money.“We need a Government that puts people and planet first, not one that thinks there’s one rule for the Conservative Party and another for everyone .”Donors to the Tories include Alexander Temerko, the Russian-born owner of Aquind. The energy boss and his company handed ious MPs, including former Cabinet ministers Liam Fox and Jeremy Hunt, and the current Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke, and the party, more than £,.Aquind plans to build a £.billion energy pipeline under the English Channel and Mr Temerko was spotted sitting with COP President Alok Sharma at this year’s exclusive Black and White Ball, a fundraiser for the Conservative Party.Ian Taylor, the former chief executive of Vitol, who reportedly turned down a knighthood offered by former PM David Cameron, has also handed the party some £, since . The company he led until  is a major trader and supplier of North Sea crude oil. Weeks before the general election in , Mercantile  Maritime gave the party some £,. The commodities trading firm was founded by oil broker and billionaire Murtaza Lakhani. Matthew Ferrey, part of an elite group of Tory donors and a former executive with oil trader Vitol, has given the party £,. It includes £, to an inidual MP, the former minister and “ Brexit hardman” Steve Baker.The Wycombe MP told an event at Tory Party conference in  that while “the science is absolutely settled” on climate change, students should be taught they will get “poorer”, “colder”, and eat “insects for protein” as a result of climate policies.  Mr Baker declined to comment. The party’s former treasurer, Mick Davis, a South African-born former executive of mining company Xstrata also handed the party around £,.  In January, he set up a firm targeting “troubled mining assets” as well as joining the board of a “coal start-up”. A Tory source insisted the Conservatives were leading the climate change debate and alleged that claims to the contrary were “misguided”. He said: “No other party in government has done more than the Conservatives to reduce Britain’s dependency on dirty fossil fuels. “While Labour did next to nothing in government, we put net zero by  into law, banned the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by , and our Net Zero Strategy sets out a clear plan to decarbonise every part of our economy to eradicate the UK’s contribution to climate change. Any suggestion this Government is somehow not committed to tackling climate change is hilariously misguided.” The Mirror approached the MPs for comment about the donations, which were registered and are not subject to a standards investigation. Calls are intensying for a crackdown on MPs having second jobs after Sir Geoffrey Cox made some £m working as a barrister and adviser.

Senior ministers today refused to defend Sir Geoffrey - after Boris Johnson said MPs must put their job in Parliament first. Chancellor Rishi Sunak refused to comment on the specic case but admitted “we need to do better” on standards. Referring to Boris Johnson trying to tear up the system to save Owen Paterson over multiple breaches of lobbying rules, Mr Sunak said: “On the broader point - and just reflecting over recent events. “I think for us as a Government, itaposs fair to say that we need to do better than we did last week, and we know that.

Because they work damn hard for their constituents and they don’t want to be tarred by these people who’ve been around for ever and seem to have a dferent set of standards and priorities.” Sir Geoffrey has said he does not believe he has breached parliamentary rules and will co-operate with any investigation. But he has claimed he had authorisation from the Tory Chief Whip to do work in the British Virgin Islands while Parliament was sitting.  In total he has taken part in hearings in the BVI’s corruption inquiry on  separate days this year when the Commons was sitting. Sir Geoffrey’s office issued a defiant statement saying he “regularly works -hour weeks” and constituency work is “given primary importance”. It went on: “Sir Geoffrey’s view is that it is up to the electors of Torridge and West Devon whether or not they vote for someone who is a senior and distinguished professional in his field and who still practices that profession. “That has been the consistent view of the local Conservative Association and although at every election his political opponents have sought to make a prominent issue of his professional practice, it has so far been the consistent view of the voters of Torridge and West Devon. “Sir Geoffrey is very content to abide by their decision.” But one unnamed constituent told PA: “I sent an email to Geoffrey Cox which I waited over  days for a response to.

So how exactly do his other jobs benefit the , people he represents in Parliament, asks Paul RoutledgeJulian Smith is the MP for Skipton and Ripon, the constituency where Paul Routledge lives Image: Barcroft Media via Getty ImagesopinionByPaul Routledge:,  Nov | commentsMy local MP, Julian Smith, is having a very profitable year. Literally. The Right Honourable Member for Skipton and Ripon earns almost as much as the Prime Minister – from his second jobs.He built up an impressive business portfolio after Boris Johnson sacked him as Northern Ireland Secretary.The House of Commons Register of Members’ Interests shows successful Smith has three places of work outside Westminster. He earns £, a year, plus VAT, as an external adviser on business development to Ryse Hydrogen of London, paid monthly, for  hours a year.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section He also trousers £, a year, plus VAT, from MJM Marine of Newry in his old Ulster bailiwick, also paid monthly, for a more onerous - hours a year. From Simply Blue Management of Newquay, he picks up another £, per month plus VAT as an adviser, and is expected to put in - hours a month. This bumper pay packet totals £, a year for what could be less than eight days’ work, some of it at £, an hour. Yet his government baulks at a £ an hour National Minimum Wage, and tells workers on Universal Credit “work two more hours” to recoup their £ benefit cut. Of course, all this lovely moolah on top of his £, a year parliamentary salaryis approved by the authorities. It is perfectly legal and above board. All I can I say is: some authority, some law, some board. Smith must have business skills not readily apparent when he was a minister. As Theresa May’s chief whip, he broke the parliamentary rules on “pairing” and lost countless votes. He couldn’t whip a top. And he lasted less than seven months in Belfast. Quite what his second-jobbery does for the , people of his largely rural constituency escapes me. Frankly, I wouldn’t pay jammy Julian in washers, but he’s not alone in cashing in on the cachet of being an MP. Dozens of them are at it. There is pressure to end the privilege. Mirror readers are in no doubt, voting % to scrap the system.  The name above Julian Smith in the Register is Jeff Smith, Labour MP for Manchester Withington. He lists his outside interests as “Nil”. Further comment would be superfluous. ****** Requiring all NHS public-facing staff to get the jab is draconian, but perhaps necessary.

They’re largely to blame for spreading the virus to doctors, nurses and staff, not the other way round. ****** Footballer Marcus Rashford got an MBE for his magnicent campaign against child poverty, not the OBE.But he can take consolation that his award means ‘My Bloody Efforts’ whereas the higher gong means ‘Other Buggers’ Efforts’.

Labour MP for Walthamstow, Stella Creasy, attempted to board a London bus with her baby on Tuesday, but was refused boarding by the driver. Ms Creasy posted a photo on Twitter showing the inside of the bus she was attempting to board.While two pushchairs can be seen in the space allocated to pushchairs and wheelchairs on the bus, the rest of the bus appears half empty, with plenty of space for another pushchair.Based on the photo MP Creasy posted, MyLondon was able to geolocate where the alleged incident took place in Chingford Mount, north east London. Tagging London’s Deputy Mayor of London for Transport, Heidi Alexander, as well as London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Ms Creasy said: “Well that wasn’t fun. “Just been kicked off an empty bus by a bus driver because there were two pushchairs already on it. “Surely when the bus is this empty andlarge amount of space as you can see it can’t be TfL policy to do this !” Her tweet triggered a wave of supportive comments from mothers who have also encountered the same problem. “I had the same problem  years ago. I had hoped that times might have moved on,” said one. Another said: “Same thing happened to me  years ago. Ridiculous rules. Passengers with babies kids in pushchairs should be prioritised alongside iniduals in wheelchairs and buses should be remodelled to be able to take more of these passengers”. One user also commented saying London Mayor Sadiq Khan “might remind drivers that it is illegal to stop or refuse to allow the transit or transport” of an MP who might be on route to Parliament. Former Liberal Democrat councillor Stephen Fenwick weighed in saying: “Surely you couldaposve used the old ‘do you know who I am ’ trick to get on board   I used it many times a few years ago when I was a cllr and got my way.” But MP Creasy replied, saying: “Would oddly enough never do that but struggling with two children, one extremely poorly, and being shouted at for just getting on a bus is not great. Also it seems bizarrea bus is not full to demand someone get off - that’s why I want to knowit’s TfL policy !” Guidelines on using pushchairson Transport for London buses can be found on the TfL website. “Drivers should make sure passengers have time to position their buggy safely, and hold on or sit down before moving away,” the TfL website says, asking passengers to “fold the buggy upitaposs too wide to fit through the doors and down the aisle”. The website says: “If youaposre using a double buggy, feel free to get on the bus at the back exit doors, but remember to check with the driver first. “For safety reasons and general passenger comfort, move your buggy out of the middle aisle. “All buses have a wheelchair space available. By law, wheelchair users have priority over the space as it is the only place they can travel safely. When a wheelchair user is not using the space, you can use it on a first come first served basis. “If a wheelchair user wishes to board a bus, you should share the space, fold your buggy or move. You will not be asked to leave the bus, but you may choose to do so. “If you wish to board the next bus instead, the driver will issue you a transfer ticket so you donapost need to pay a double fare”.

Natalie Elphicke earns almost £ an hour in her work outside Parliament as the chair of the New Homes Quality Board. She was handed a one-off £, in November , and since January has been paid just under £ per week for eight hours’ work, on top of her £k job as an MP. The organisation exists to “promote a new code for housebuilding standards” and Ms Elphicke has spent almost  hours on the job since she was appointed in May . Ms Elphicke is one of scores of MPs with work outside Parliament, a practice ministers insist brings a “richness” to Parliamentary experience. But she is now in the spotlight because of comments she made about Marcus Rashford, for which she apologised in July.  England suffered heartbreak in the Euro  final after a - penalty shootout loss handed victory to Italy. And Ms Elphicke hit headlines after questioning Rashfordaposs commitment to the game when he missed a penalty. She wrote to Tory MPs: Would it be ungenerous to say Rashford should have spent more time perfecting his game and less time playing politics. Rashford, who was awarded an MBE for his campaigning for vulnerable children, forced the Government into embarrassing U-turns on free school meals and has raised more than £m for charity. Labour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner blasted Ms Elphicke for sneering at the inspirational player at the time. Tory MP Simon Hoare said: Would it be ungenerous  Yes. Unwarranted  Yes. Wrong  Yes. Downing Street also slapped down the MP, saying she had rightly apologised. Ms Elphicke said at the time: I regret messaging privately a rash reaction about Marcus Rashfordaposs missed penalty and apologise to him for any suggestion that he is not fully focussed on his football. Ms Rayner said last night: “Marcus Rashford is the pride of Manchester and he doesn’t need the permission of anyone to do the wonderful work that he does.“ Boris Johnson needs to decide whether his MPs are MPs representing their constituents orthey are advisers and consultants working for private interests who pay them. They can’t be both.“It’s time for the Prime Minister to come out of hiding.

So, at the beginning of , she booked herself in. I spotted a beauty salon was running a training day, and required models with a trainer who had more than  years’ experience. At £, it seemed like a great opportunity at a price I could afford. I wanted to give myself a new yearaposs lt, Barbara, , said. But when she went to have the procedure, she claims something didnapost feel right.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here My treatment was really painful, and it felt very rushed. I was keen to get it over with as it hurt so much. The final result felt very tight, but looked fine, she recalled. After the treatment, Barbara was sent on her way and told to take ibuprofenshe felt any discomfort. She was also told to wait six weeks to see the full results. The next day, Barbara claims she felt something snap in her face - but when she called the salon, she was told it was normal. She said: “My face felt extremely tight and painful and even chewing was dficult but I believed it would settle as they told me it would. A few days later, she felt a bump above her top lip.  When I touched it, it felt sharp and stung, like it was piercing my skin. I contacted the salon again, and was told to try and manipulate the thread back up, and to not mess with it, she said. I was so concerned I sent a video of myself doing exactly as instructed to the salon, to show them. The next day she became even more concerned when a blue thread pierced the skin by her top lip and she pulled it out. “The thread had a cog on and came out of my face! Fortunately, there was no major bleeding, but I was incredibly concerned that my face would become lopsided.” After calling the salon to complain, she claims she was told it was her own fault. Barbara added: At no point did the trainer contact me directly to check on me. She had washed her hands of the whole thing. Terried her face was damaged forever, Barbara found another thread piercing her skin, near her eye. When she tried to pull out the thread, the cog at the end got caught on her skin tissue, which caused it to pucker. By now, blood was streaming down her face as she tried to push it back in. In the end, she managed to remove the thread by slowly manoeuvring it outward. I was left with two further lumps. One by my chin and another by my nose. I feared both threads would poke through at any moment, she said. I took myself to AE who were supportive, but said they couldn’t touch it as it was cosmetic and they would not risk hurting me further. I was beside myself. The pain was so bad I contemplated buying a scalpel to cut the threads out of my face. After conducting her own research, Barbara found Save Face, a national register of medical practitioners accredited to provide non-surgical cosmetic treatments.She travelled to River Aesthetics clinic in Bournemouth, which is a training centre for Silhouette Soft threadlts - which are only available from medically qualied clinicians.After a consultation with the clinicians, Barbara was determined unsuitable for threadlting treatment in the first place due to an autoimmune condition. Dr Manning, from River Aesthetics, said: “A medical professional would have identied this immediately.  “We could clearly see the threads had been inserted superficially and had migrated signicantly since their placement. “The threads were unlike any we had seen before. We suspect they may not have even reached UK standards. “ Dr Manning added he worked with Barbara to remove as much of the thread as he could from her face - and added she was lucky not to have been disfigured by her experience. We strongly urge anyone considering aesthetic treatments to research the treatment provider and the treatment itself, he said. Three months later, when Barbaraaposs face had fully healed, she went back to the clinic for the new look sheaposd originally wanted.The clinicians used MaiLi filler to plump up her cheeks, add definition to her jawline and enhance her lips.Barbara said: “I would strongly urge anyone contemplating an aesthetic treatment, to thoroughly research everything and ask questions about the qualications of the treatment provider, the treatment modality, the products being used. Seethey are accredited by Save Face. “Don’t do what I did and be seduced by the price and the promise that someone is a ‘trainer’.Have you ever had a cosmetic procedure that didnapost go to plan  Send your stories to jessica.taylor@reachplc“Iaposm absolutely thrilled with the results now. I should have researched the suitability of dferent procedures and treatments and got a better understanding from the experts about the results that I could expect to achieve. “We now know that I wasn’t suitable for PDO threads so itaposs frustrating to think that I went through all of that pain and worry for nothing.” Comment MORE ON Cosmetic surgeryPlastic surgery\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mr Abbott, who lives in the lands of the iconic London landmark with  other Yeoman Warders and their families, said it would likely raise a few eyebrowsa For Sale sign appeared outside his two-bed flat. He tweeted: “Thanks for the very kind offer Foxtons to sell or rent out the th century property that HM Tower of London provide me with, however, I think it may raise a few eyebrows when your sign appears outside my house.  The letter - believed to be from the Wapping branch of the agents - said we are valuing property in your area next week before offering to give a no strings attached professional opinion of the sales or rental value of your property in the current market. The Beefeaters are the oldest military corp and existing military corp royal bodyguards in the country.

The -year-old had just missed hopping aboard the last service from Beverley Bus Station to Dunswell in East Yorkshire.She pleaded with the bus driver to let her on the vehicle so she could get home, but he refused, Hull Daily Mail reported. Fortunately a police officer witnessed the encounter and came over to see what was going on. The girlaposs dad, Gary Hockney, said: She was so upset. It happened on Sunday night and on Monday she didnapost go to college. She was frightened to go on the bus because she goes on a public bus and she was worried that she would bump into this driver.  She came back on Monday and she was in tears about it and explained that was why. The teenager tried to board the East Yorkshire Bus service at .pm on Sunday, November , after visiting her friends. She claims that as she reached the bus it began to pull away. The girl stood in front of the bus while it was still in the parking bay so she was visible to the driver. But, she claims he refused to let her on and instead continually beeped the horn, flashed his lights and revved the engine while she was in tears. Can you just open the door, I need to get home, she can be heard saying in a video.  A police officer believed to have been dealing with another incident at the station came over after witnessing the incident unfold and spoke with the bus driver, who said that he could not open the doors due to health and safety reasons. Speaking about the incident, Mr Hockney said: In her words, which isnapost wrong going by the footage, the bus was still in the parking bay and as she approached it, it began to pull away. She was directly in front of the doors and in full view of the driver. He looked at her, he saw her and carried on pulling out. She started crying at one point and heaposs revving his engine, flashing his lights, beeping his horn and then fortunately a police officer in the station at the time came over and asked what was going on. If you look at the footage, she challenged the driver and he just referred to this blunt health and safety policy.  Fortunately for the girl, the police officer gave her a lt back home. Mr Hockney said: I want to draw attention to his actions but also the officers, because itaposs such a positive thing that she did, I would have picked her up but it was such a nice gesture. Having thought about it might be that the bus company doesnapost allow that sort of discretion, which is stupid. They should give their employees the confidence to make those decisions. Iaposm sure he would have let his own daughter on in that situation orhe saw somebody being chased or something surely at some point thereaposs a cut off and you show some discretion. A spokesperson for East Yorkshire Buses said: On Sunday night one of our buses was in the process of leaving Beverley Bus Station at its scheduled departure time when a late arriving passenger ran out in front of it to try to stop it leaving. For safety reasons, our drivers are advised not to allow any more passengers to board once they have closed the doors and reversed off the bus station stands, as it is unsafe for passengers to try to enter the part of the station where buses are moving. The passenger refused to move from in front of the bus, so a police officer who was in the station dealing with some antisocial behaviour came to speak to the driver, and agreed to give the passenger a lt home so that the bus could continue on its way. Our driver was satisfied that the passenger was safe, and the bus was able to continue with its journey.We’d advise that passengers always ensure they arrive at their bus stop in good time, and we have live tracking features on our website and app which you can use to ensure you never miss a bus.” Comment MORE ON Teenagers\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Fish World which was originally called Meat Wize previously had a red and black sign but gave itself the new name aposFish Worldapos and a brand new blue paint job after it introduced fish to its shop. Now the two stores share a similar identity - with what appears to be the same colour frontage - which the owner of Fish Universe claims has led to much confusion from customers.  Rafa Kashefi, , owner of Fish Universe which has been on Micham Road since , said: They stole everything from us. They stole the sign of the shop, the layout, the name, even the unorm!They arenapost on Google, when you search their name we come up first.He added: We are a family business that has worked hard for our reputation, for them to come along and do this is an insult. Rafa is left baffled as to why his neighbours had aposcopiedapos his branding.  He explained: We used to say aposHiapos and aposHow are youapos every day for the last three years, then one day they do this. I donapost speak to them because thereaposs no point trying to reason with a person who does that. One of our customers went in there once and asked why they did it, but they were just told it isnapost any of their business. In response, Fish Universe has adopted a new colour palette in an attempt to distinguish itself from its new competitor. Alongside the new palettes, a notice has been up on its door which reads: Fish Universe is not associated with Fish World and does not promote, endorse or support this shop.  In no event will we be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential or incidental damages or any damages whatsoever, arising out of the use of a Fish World service or product. We are highly qualied fishmongers, and we are passionate about fish and the environment. Fish Universe opened its doors in December  with the ambition of bringing the freshest and best quality fish to our customers in Tooting. We have stayed true to our core values, ensuring every single product we sell is the freshest, best quality available. Fish Universe is not liable for any loss arisen from either the use of a Fish World product or service. aposWe are also not responsible for the accuracy of any information advice given to you. The identical branding has even left the local council confused.  Rafa claims he was sent a fly-tipping fine after a number of items were left on the road outside an alleyway leading to both shops, however, the CCTV images sent to him by the council actually showed men he claimed were from Fish World. On the other hand, Manan, owner of Fish World and who requested his surname not be included, protested that his neighbour was simply jealous that he has the bigger fish empire. But when asked on the issue of collecting waste from the pavement, Manon declined to speak. Manan, who said he has been a fishmonger for  years, said: People are copying me, I’m not copying anyone.  Our shops are completely dferent. We added this new fish bit recently but we sell meat, they don’t sell meat. We sell other products they don’t sell. We sell African and Caribbean fish that they don’t. It’s a nonsense, they are jealous that’s all. Business is free here so for him to say that is a nonsense. Rafa, from Fish Universe, said he has been frustrated by a lack of support from Wandsworth Borough Council. He said: When I need to pay my business rate, they get in contact. When they they want to ly accuse me of fly tipping, they get in contact. But when I ask the council to help me with someone stealing our brand, they don’t want to help. As someone who pays a lot of money in business rates, thataposs very frustrating. When contacted by MyLondon, Wandsworth Council said the council cannot resolve a civil dispute between neighbouring shops. A spokesperson said: The aggrieved shopkeeper needs to seek his own legal advice on this matter.

Yesterday the Government confirmed it will be mandatory for frontline NHS workers to have the Covid vaccine.With the exception of those with a medical reason not to, everyone must have had two jabs, most likely by April. Reluctantly I think it is the right call. No one should be made to do anything they don’t want to do. Butpeople don’t want the vaccination then they shouldn’t be in jobs that involve looking after some of the sickest and most vulnerable people in our society. Mandatory jabs are nothing new. Healthcare staff doing certain procedures need to have had the hepatitis B vaccine.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Some argue that’s dferent as people who went into the profession knew they had to have the jab beforehand, so were able to make their own choices, while this is something retrospective. But we are where we are. It’s nothing short of a miracle that we have vaccines to protect us from a virus that has already claimed the lives of , people in Britain alone. I believe in the Covid vaccines. I’m double jabbed. I certainly wouldn’t ask someone to do something I wouldn’t be prepared to do myself.  But I also have an  year old grandmother with a lung condition – she needs a machine at night to help with her breathing. Would I be happy for an unvaccinated health worker to look after her  From a totally selfish point of view I wouldn’t. I want the safest pairs of hands possible giving her care. The NHS, scientists and our political leaders need to do a much better job of explaining that the vaccines are safe and have been tested on people across the world. I feel desperately sorry for anyone who feels they will have to leave the profession over this – there are already , unfilled positions in the NHS in England. They certainly shouldn’t be hounded out of the profession. Maybe they can be found jobs where they don’t come into contact with vulnerable people. I hope before April’s deadline more workers are convinced about the efficacy of the vaccines and roll up their sleeves to have the jab. It would be a shame to lose dedicated workers when we need them more than ever.

PC Andrew Wienand, or “PC Pants” as his colleagues now call him, dashed out of his home when he saw what was happening and even had a pickaxe thrown at his head, narrowly missing him. He was woken up in the middle of the night by loud banging coming from outside his bedroom window in Barnes. The officer, who had got home from work late the night before, awoke at .am on the morning of May , , to the commotion. His girlfriend looked outside the window to find four masked men taking it in turns to smash a pickaxe into the bulletproof window of the jewellery shop below his flat. After she told PC Wienand to do something to stop it, he leapt up without getting dressed and went outside to intervene. PC Weinand, who had moved to London from South Africa a few years ago, said: “I woke up super groggy and not knowing what was happening, and then I looked outside and the men looked up at me right in the eye. “They were fully clothed in black with balaclavas, helmets, and gloves and they had a pickaxe. “The building was shaking as the bulletproof glass was resisting and the panic started building in me when I realised that our door was the one next to the jewellers and they might have thought this was another way in. “I got scared, and when I get scared, I get angry and fight or flight kicked in.  “I thought ‘screw it’, and ran down the stairs in my boxer shorts before yelling at them in Afrikaans - my second language. “I thought it might frighten them - along with my bare chest, pasty white body, and lots of hair. “One of the guys picked up the pickaxe and I thought they were going to come and hit me in the head with it so I thought my only chance was to run at them. “So I did, screaming, and yelling to my missus to call the police. “The guy pegged the pickaxe at my head and I jumped left - and thankfully I did because it missed me very narrowly and I would have been deadit had hit.” The -year-old managed to disarm the robber and he picked up the pickaxe before chasing the masked men off with it. When recalling the incident, he explained that there were five men in total - one in a car with the boot open, two on mopeds, and the other two who were trying to smash the glass. PC Wienand said: “When I chased them they jumped and split off to go into dferent directions. “I was actually running barefoot over all the bulletproof glass that they’d shattered but I didn’t feel the pain at the time because my adrenaline was pumping. “It wasn’t the smartest thing to do and I was very new in the police at the time. “But, I’d do it again because when you are scared you go to base instincts and I’m a fighter. “A lot of people did nothing and just watched and my colleagues said they wouldn’t have done anything - but again, I’d definitely still do it again.”  PC Weinand then warned: “If a predator smells fear then you become the prey.” Shortly after, police officers arrived at the scene and PC Wienand, who usually works in the Hammersmith area, gave them the “pull over” signal, which he learned not long before during his police training. He told the officers what had happened as other police cars went screeching after the mopeds. According to PC Weinand, the suspect got away and was “unfortunately” never caught. PC Wienand added: “Ideally next time this happens I’d like to be in unorm with a baton and a little bit of pepper spray. “I don’t live at the address anymore so I’m not actually worried though. “I’m not sureit’s heroic, probably stupid more than anything - and my colleagues give me so much hassle it’s not even funny. “It’s all good-natured banter.” After the incident took place, PC Wienand was nominated for the  Police Bravery Award and although he didn’t win, his granny was proud of his heroism. He said: “I was overjoyed to be nominated andanything it was my granny who was happiest. “She’s  and she would go down to her local coffee shop and tell everyone that it was her grandson that stopped the masked men on Barnes High Street. “I did always want her to be proud of me and that’s happened.” His granny wasn’t the only one who was proud of his actions and the rumour about what had happened soon spread high up the chain of command. PC Weinand said: “At the awards, the Met Police deputy commissioner who is really high up said to me, ‘are you Pants Man ’ “I was like oh my gosh this person is so many ranks above me and he’s calling me Pants Man. “My colleagues use that name, PC Pants or Captain Underpants - and a few of them do call me a hero. “It’s all part of why I became a police officer though - to help people.” Although he was new to the job, PC Weinand explained that he had been subjected to similarly scary situations. He said: “And, that isn’t even the half of it, I’ve had someone try to rob me on my way to work who then chased me to the police station and a guy try to stab me and set me on fire.” In light of the armed robbery, a spokesperson for the politan Police said: “ A -year-old officer was off-duty when he was awoken by a disturbance near his home in Barnes High Street, SW, at about :hrs on Friday,  May. “He realised a jeweller’s shop window had been smashed and that suspects were attempting to break in. “Acting instantly, he ran out into the street in just his boxers - he challenged them and a pick axe was thrown at him. “It narrowly missed him and he picked it up and ran at the suspects to stop them further breaking into the shop. “The suspects managed to escape on mopeds but left behind a number of weapons including a pick-axe, sledgehammer, and a chisel. “The shop window was damaged but the suspects did not manage to break in and steal any property. “The officer cut his foot on broken glass but was not otherwise injured.” Commander Sally Benatar from the South West Borough Command Unit said: “The bravery of this officer undoubtedly stopped the suspects from stealing anything from the premises. “He is a brand new officer, merely days into his role as a PC and he should be very proud of his actions. “I have spoken to him today to thank him for his outstanding efforts. “This morning’s events go to show that police officers are never off-duty and will always go above and beyond to help their community.” Comment MORE ON politan Policepolitan Police ServiceCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The suspect was caught on camera passing the Hendersons’ front garden with a drink can in his hand. Seconds later the plastic turf was rolled up and taken away. Daughter Courtney, , said: “My mum opened the curtains and was like: ‘Where’s the grass gone ’ “She was really confused at first and rang my dad askinghe knew why someone had taken the grass.” She added: “It’s really bizarre because it’s like the smallest piece of grass ever.” A neighbour’s CCTV captured the moment the turf was lted at pm on Sunday as the family sat in their lounge in Heywood, Gtr Manchester, last Sunday. Courtney said: “It was at around pm, like an hour after my dad got in. I was literally on the couch at the time. “I don’t think it could be someone trying to sell it for money because it’s the tiniest thing ever, it must only be worth around £ at the most.”  The beauty business owner said the thief had a distinct walk and was wearing a bucket hat. She added: “I just don’t get how no one has seen a man walking down the street with a roll of grass. “He’s got a distinct walk and he’s wearing a bucket hat. Surely someone knows this guy as there can’t be that many people walking around Heywood with a can and a bucket hat.” Comment MORE ON CCTVCCTV footageCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Volunteers for the British Divers Marine Le Rescuesoon arrived at the scene and found the whale half-submerged in the water. As they accessed the best way to get it back out to sea, the massive whale managed to free itself but was almost stranded a second time on nearby rocks. After wildly thrashing around, it made its own way out into deeper water and was monitored swimming strongly in an easterly direction.  But its body was found further along the coastline, the BDMLR said in an update on Thursday. The update read: “The Sei whale has sadly been found dead after restranding on a beach a little further up the coast. “Unfortunately the survival rate of large whales who have already stranded is quite low as there is usually a reason for why they have beached themselves. “Scottish Marine Animal Strandings Schemewill be attending to perform a necropsy on the animal and they will share their results with us to seethere was any underlying cause. “A sad ending to what was a hopeful rescue.”  In an earlier post, they described how the team had been drafted in to try to help the stricken whale. They wrote: “Yesterday, Wednesday th November , we received a callout to a stranding of a whale in North Queensferry, Scotland. “A team of our trained Marine Mammal Medics were dispatched to attend to the animal. It appeared the animal was stuck in chest-deep water and was unable to free itself. “On arrival, all our team could see was a long back and a tall dorsal fin with the odd breath from its blowhole. “From the large dorsal, plus the fact it measured .m in , it was determined to be a Sei whale. “The fact that the whale was upright in the water certainly increased its probability of survival, but the fact that it was submerged made it much more dficult to assess. “However, it appeared to be in a moderate condition and was moving excessively in an attempt free itself from the sand. “It managed to turn itself to face out of the bay, and just as our medics were exiting the water to make consolidated rescue plans, the whale made a big effort to swim out to sea. “Quickly, our medics made noises underwater in order to create a wall of sound to deter the whale from swimming closer to shore and persuade it to swim in the right direction. “As it swam off, the whale looped round to the left of the bay and almost restranded itself again, floundering on some rocks. “Just as medics were preparing to get back into the water for further support, the whale made its way into deeper water and swam successfully off into the open sea. “It was last seen headed East and swimming strongly.” Comment MORE ON Daily RecordRemembrance DayWhalesAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Meghan sued the newspaper publisher claiming it misused her private information, infringed herand breached the Data Protection Act and won the case. But an appeal by the publisher is currently being heard and yesterday several bombshell claims were made by Mr Knauf in a court statement, including that Meghan wrote the letter to her dad knowing it could be leaked and that she and Harry did help the authors of the biography Finding Freedom. But who exactly is Jason Knauf, how did he end up working for Harry and Meghan and what is he doing now  Hereaposs what we know... Royal aide Mr Knauf originally hails from New Zealand and is a graduate of Victoria University in Wellington. He also gained a masters in politics and communication from the London School of Economics. He previously worked as an advisor to former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and worked at HM Treasury, where he was the press secretary to financial services secretary Lord Myners. Mr Knauf was also a Director of Corporate Affairs at the Royal Bank of Scotland before joining the royal household in .Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.His first job there was communications secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.After Harry married Meghan, he also looked after their communications at Kensington Palace. He even attended their wedding in May .Earlier this year, it was reported in The Times that in , Mr Knauf reportedly submitted an email to Prince Williamaposs private secretary Simon Case alleging unacceptable behaviour by Meghan. The email reportedly claimed the Duchess had bullied two PAs out of their jobs in the previous year. It also claimed that Meghan seemed intent on always having someone in her sights, and Mr Knauf said he had received “report after report” from people who witnessed unacceptable behaviour” by Meghan towards a member of staff.  The report was published just days before Harry and Meghanaposs tell-all chat with Oprah Winfrey and in a statement in March, the couple said: We are disappointed to see this defamatory portrayal of The Duchess of Sussex given credibility by a media outlet. It’s no coincidence that distorted several-year-old accusations aimed at undermining The Duchess are being briefed to the British media shortly before she and The Duke are due to speak openly and honestly about their experience of recent years. The Duchess is saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself and is deeply committed to supporting those who have experienced pain and trauma. She is determined to continue her work building compassion around the world and will keep striving to set an example for doing what is right and doing what is good.Buckingham Palace said they would investigate the claims but it could be some time before the final report is released, The Times reports.Royal Foundation  Mr Knauf continued in his role as communications secretary before being appointed as senior adviser to William and Kate in March , when William and Harryaposs households became separate. However, in September  he was appointed the chief executive officer of William and Kateaposs Royal Foundation.Earlier this year, it was revealed he would be stepping down from the position at the end of  ahead of a planned international relocation.Royal praise In a joint statement on his departure, William and Kate said: Jason has been an integral part of our team since . We are immensely grateful for his hard work and commitment, both at The Royal Foundation and previously as our Communications Secretary. Since taking over as Chief Executive, Jason has driven positive change, making our vision for our charitable work and the causes that matter most to us a reality. We are sad to see him go but wish him all the very best in his future career.  We look forward to launching the recruitment search shortly and welcoming a new Chief Executive later on this year. Mr Knauf added: Working with The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge has been the privilege of my career. I will always be grateful for the opportunity I have had to support their leadership in the UK and internationally. The months ahead will be the busiest time in the Foundation’s history with the first awards for The Earthshot Prize and more progress on our early childhood work. We have a lot to do with our amazing team and all of our partners. Bombshell claims Yesterday, Mr Knaufaposs explosive new evidence was heard during the second day of an appeal by the publisher of the Mail On Sunday against a High Court judgeaposs decision that the publication of a letter from Meghan to her father Thomas was unlawful. Lawyers for Associated Newspapers Limitedtold senior judges on Tuesday that they want to rely on a recent witness statement made by Mr Knauf in their legal bid to overturn the ruling. Mr Knauf said in his written evidence : She also asked a specic question regarding addressing Mr Markle as aposdaddyapos in the letter, saying aposgiven Iaposve only ever called him daddy it may make sense to open as such , and in the unfortunate event that it leaked it would pull at the heartstringsapos. He said Meghan had deliberately ended each page part way through a sentence so that no page could be ly presented as the end of the letter. In the event that it was leaked she wanted the full narrative as set out in the letter to be understood and shared, he continued. Rebutting Mr Knaufaposs evidence, Meghan said: The proposition that saying that I recognised that it was possible that my father would leak the letter, albeit unlikely, is the same as saying that I thought it likely that he would do so is, I would suggest, absurd.Meanwhile, Mr Knauf also said Meghan and Harry agreed to collaborate with the authors of the bestselling book Finding Freedom. The book was described as an unauthorised biography, and the royal couple said they were not interviewed for the book and did not contribute to it.The Court of Appeal heard on Wednesday that Meghan and Harry authorised specic cooperation in writing in December  to the authors of Finding Freedom .Mr Knauf said the book was discussed directly with the Duchess multiple times in person and over email and that Meghan gave him helpful written background reminders briefing notes. He added that in an email: “The Duchess…added the briefing points she wanted me to share with the authors in my meeting with them. And, in a December  email to the aide, he says Harry wrote: I totally agree we have to be able to say we didn’t have anything to do with it. Equally, you giving the right context and background to them would help get some truths out there…especially around Markle wedding stuff… Meghan has since apologised in a statement to the court and accepted that Mr Knauf did brief the authors of Finding Freedom with her knowledge.She said: I apologise to the Court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time. I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the Defendant or the Court.

Jason Knauf is said to have repeatedly refused to help the Mail on Sunday in its bitter legal battle with the Duchess of Sussex saying he wanted to stay “neutral”.But court papers allege the -year-old performed a dramatic U-turn in the aftermath of three major royal crises, The Sun reports.The first was in February when Meghan won her High Court case against the publication over a leaked letter she sent to her -year-old estranged dad Thomas.  Meghan penned the emotional letter in  and parts of it were then reproduced in the Mail on Sunday the next year. The -year-old claimed it misused her private information, infringed herand breached the Data Protection Act and won the case. In March, Buckingham Palace said it had launched an official investigation following a complaint by Mr Knauf that Meghan had bullied three members of household staff.The announcement came just days before the bombshell two-hour interview with Meghan , Harry and the US chat show queen Oprah Winfrey was aired.The couple made a number of explosive royal claims including alleging that a senior royal asked how “dark” Harry and Meghan’s son Archie would be when he was born.Meghan, an ex-actress, also claimed that royal le had left her on the verge of suicide.  At the time of the interview being aired Mr Knaufwas being represented by lawyers acting for three other royal aides dubbed the “Palace Four”.On April , they said Mr Knauf still wished to stay “strictly neutral” despite repeated approaches from the Mail on Sundayaposs parent company, Associated Newspapers. A month later Mr Knauf announced he was stepping down as Meghanaposs communication secretary before a “confidential source” approached the Mail on Sunday to tell them he had undergone a dramatic change of heart. During the third and final day of the hearing on Thursday, further documents were released which revealed that a confidential source contacted the publisher with the information that Mr Knauf, who is due to stand down from his current role as the chief executive officerof the Royal Foundation at the end of the year, regretted not giving evidence during the High Court proceedings. In a witness statement, Keith Mathieson, solicitor for ANL, said he believed Mr Knauf’s evidence was “honest and credible”.  Mr Mathieson said that, in April, Mr Knauf’s then legal team contacted ANL’s lawyers to say he did not wish to have any involvement in the proceedings and that his position was “strictly neutral”. However, following the judgment in Meghan’s favour, ANL was contacted by the source in July and approached Mr Knauf, who by then wished to provide a statement for the appeal. He added: “Mr Knauf was plainly a central figure in the events he describes. “He was a senior and trusted member of the royal household staff and he continues to occupy an important position as CEO of The Royal Foundation. “His witness statement is measured in tone and he has been careful not to include evidence of matters beyond his own personal knowledge. “Given the high profile nature of this litigation and the likelihood of his evidencebeing widely reported, as well as the position he holds, it is hardly conceivable that he would say anything he did not believe to be true and I know of nothing in his evidence which is subject to any reasonable challenge. Mr Knauf was communications secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry from February  to May . After Harry and Meghan’s wedding he became communications secretary to both couples until March . Later that year he became CEO of the Cambridges’ Royal Foundation charity, a position he will step down from next month.

Keith Mathieson, representing the publisher, told appeal court judges it was only in July this year, months after Meghan’s High Court triumph, that Associated Newspapers had “received information from a confidential source to the effect that Mr Knauf now regretted not providing a witness statement to us”. He added: “Mr Knauf was plainly a central figure in the events he describes. “He was a senior and trusted member of the royal household staff and he continues to occupy an important position.  “His witness statement is measured in tone and he has been careful not to include evidence of matters beyond his own personal knowledge. Given the high-profile nature of this litigation and the likelihood of his evidencebeing widely reported, as well as the position he holds, it is hardly conceivable that he would say anything he did not believe to be true and I know of nothing in his evidence which is subject to any reasonable challenge.” Meghan sued Associated Newspapers Limited over five articles that reproduced parts of a “personal and private” letter she wrote to her father.  Lord Justice Warby gave his High Court ruling in a summary judgment, avoiding the need for a trial. But ANL says the case should go to a trial on Meghan’s claims including breach of privacy and . Andrew Caldecott QC, representing ANL, told the court yesterday that the letter to Thomas Markle from Meghan was “not a loving letter, not a generous letter”, contrary to how it was presented.  Justin Rushbrooke QC, for Meghan, previously described the case as “very straightforward” and said her human rights were “triply engaged” by the publication of part of the letter. In her written evidence to the Court of Appeal, Meghan denied she thought it likely that her father would leak the letter, but “merely recognised that this was a possibility”. She said: “To be clear, I did not want any of it to be published, and wanted to ensure that the risk of it being manipulated or misleadingly edited was minimised, were it to be exploited.”  Sir Geoffrey Vos, sitting with Dame Victoria Sharp and Lord Justice Bean, will give their ruling at a later date. Meghan sued Associated Newspapers Limited , which is also the publisher of MailOnline, over five articles that reproduced parts of a personal and private letter to her father. She won her case earlier this year after Lord Justice Warby ruled that ANLaposs publication of Meghanaposs letter to her father was unlawful in a summary judgment, avoiding the need for a trial.  The challenge, launched in the Court of Appeal over the last three days, argued the case should go to a trial on Meghanaposs claims including breach of privacy and . Andrew Caldecott QC, representing ANL, told the court on Thursday that Mr Markle faced nasty and untrue allegations in an article published by People magazine in the US and there was a public interest in correcting them. He added that the letter to Mr Markle from Meghan was not a loving letter, not a generous letter, contrary to how it was presented in the People article. The barrister continued: When we come to the very first allegation about cold-shouldering her at the wedding... this allegation is demonstrably , we say. Justin Rushbrooke QC, for Meghan, previously described the case as very straightforward and said her human rights were triply engaged by the publication of part of the letter. He said: This was a letter of which extensive contents, about half of it, were first published by the defendant without the consent of the complainant, or even notication.  In her written evidence to the Court of Appeal, Meghan denied she thought it likely that her father would leak the letter, but merely recognised that this was a possibility. She said: To be clear, I did not want any of it to be published, and wanted to ensure that the risk of it being manipulated or misleadingly edited was minimised, were it to be exploited, she continued. Sir Geoffrey Vos, sitting with Dame Victoria Sharp and Lord Justice Bean, said they will take time to consider their decision and give their ruling at a later date.

Prince Harryaposs official biographer Angela Levin says Meghan is brushing off new evidence in her court battle with the Mail on Sunday asitaposs nothing. But the details being revealed by former aide Jason Knauf at the High Court are very serious and could cause signicant damage to her reputation, Ms Levin says. The new evidence lead Meghan to issue an apology statement, in which she said she hadnapost remembered the emails between her and Mr Knauf and had no wish or intention to mislead the court. It comes amid the final stages of Meghanaposs legal fight with the publishers of the Mail on Sunday, Associated Newspapers Ltd . The mum-of-two, , took issue with the paper printing what she says was a private and personal five-page letter written to her estranged dad, Thomas Markle. In the letter the Duchess begs him to not speak to the media about her. Though Meghan won her case at the High Court in February, ANL appealed - and they claim to have bombshell details which could overturn the decision.  Yesterday Meghan was forced to apologise to the court for not disclosing emails in which she attempted to influence a biography about her and Harry. The emails, released by the Court of Appeal, showed that two years ago the couple gave press spokesman Jason Knauf a detailed brief before meeting biography writers Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand. Another email exchange, revealed by Mr Knauf, showed messages Meghan wrote to estranged dad Thomas, , after the royal wedding. Meghan told him she would call him daddy to pull at the heartstringsthe messages were leaked, Mr Knauf claimed.  The -year-old Duchess has strongly denied helping Scobie and Durand to write the Finding Freedom biography. But in  pages of court documents, Mr Knauf swore the Sussexes told him what to tell the authors. Palace aides are finally getting their own back at the Sussexes, Ms Levin - who spent a year with Harry writing his biography - told GB News. I think the whole thing is absolutely extraordinary, she told the broadcaster.  What is astonishing is that the Palace aides are now talking and saying what they think has really happened. Before, they followed the Queenaposs motto - which is to never complain and never explain, and staff did this too. But Meghan and Harry are a dferent breed now and [their comments are] thought to be so unfair and wrong that aides now going to speak about their views. She claims the Duchess tried brushing away Mr Knaufaposs evidence as though itaposs nothing.  But Ms Levin claims in the court setting she was in It is very serious. She explained: What she said in court was not true and I think her credibility will suffer for this in a signicant way. Ms Levin says the Duchess is also desperate to not lose against the publisher.  She doesnapost like to be beaten - she wants to win, and sometimes she goes overboard, she said. She doesnapost listen to detail, she doesnapost want to be told, she just wants to forge ahead. In a new witness statement, Meghan apologised to the court and accepted Mr Knauf did brief the Finding Freedom authors with her knowledge. She said: I apologise to the Court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time. I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the Defendant or the Court. The Duchess added that had she known about the emails she would have been more than happy to refer to them as strongly supportive of her case. The Finding Freedom biography, published in August , detailed the married lives of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - and their infamous split from the Royal Family. The book was described as an unauthorised biography, and the royal couple have previously denied that they were involved with its creation.However the Court of Appeal heard on Wednesday that Meghan and Harry authorised specic cooperation in writing in December  to the authors of Finding Freedom .The book was discussed directly with the Duchess multiple times in person and over email, the court heard, and Meghan was said to give him helpful written background reminders.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Mail on SundayMeghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal FamilyFinding Freedom\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Thomas has been critical about Meghan and Harry and once again fired an attack at them in an interview where he criticised the Duke of Sussex before the  royal wedding. He claims he invited Meghan and Harry to his home in Mexico several times but they never took him up on his offer.  Thomas told GB News: “I’m very disappointed that Harry, wanting to marry my daughter, wouldn’t have had the good sense to come down here and ask for her hand. Someone who is royalty I would think would want to go by the book and do things properly but apparently it didn’t matter to him so that was a disappointment as well.” Thomas said he wanted to play a role in the lives of Meghan and Harry and his two grandchildren. “I certainly always want my family especially now the older I get the more I need my family, he said.  The father and daughter have reportedly not been on speaking terms since Thomas staged a photo shoot for press before his daughter got married to Harry in . He did not attend the wedding after having a heart attack and needing surgery. Mr Markle last appeared on British TV screens at the end of October when he was interviewed on Good Morning Britain. During the attack on the Sussexes, Thomas claimed he was being ghosted by Meghan and has vowed to continue to publicly attack his daughter until she begins speaking to him again. I think Harry has abandoned the Queen, the royal family, the British people and the Army. Heaposs abandoned them all, he said on GMB.

Statistics from the British Heart Foundation show that every eight minutes somebody dies from coronary heart disease and the importance to take steps to keep the organ healthy.High cholesterol is extremely common and it increases your risk of heart attack and disease, so it is crucial to keep it at a healthy level, reported the Irish Mirror.For good heart health and healthy cholesterol, the BHF recommends people have a diet with fruit and vegetables, and less fatty food.  What is High Cholesterol  Cholesterol is a type of fat found in your blood which is made in the body mainly by the liver and it is needed for all body cells to produce important hormones. Butthere is too much cholesterol in your blood, it sticks to your artery walls to form atheroma or plaque. This build-up on the artery walls means your arteries become narrowed and this process also called the hardening of the arteries. If an artery supplying the heart muscle becomes blocked completely, the muscle becomes damaged and this is known as a heart attack. Similarlyan artery to the brain is completely blocked, it damages the brain and this is called a stroke.  Symptoms of High Cholesterol High cholesterol in itself does not usually cause symptoms but the build-up of fatty material on the artery walls and the narrowing does leave to ious conditions and these depend on where the blockage occurs.Angina Acute coronary syndrome Heart attackthe heart is affected Stroke or TIAthe brain is affected Leg pain and intermittent pain when walkingthe peripheral arteries are affected.The body can produce all the cholesterol it needs and can usually maintain a healthy level of blood cholesterol. Good cholesterolHDL cholesterol is called good cholesterol or healthy cholesterol because it mops up cholesterol left behind in your arteries and carries it to your liver where it is broken down and passed out of your body. Regular physical activity and exercise can help increase your HDL level but problems arise when the balance goes wrong and there is an increase in bad cholesterol called LDL. This may result from inherited problems or from eating too much saturatedfat or too many foods from the top shelf of the Food Pyramid.  Bad cholesterolLDL cholesterol travels from your liver through your arteries to other parts of your body. LDL is called bad cholesterol because it sticks to the walls in your arteries - making them narrow. Prevention If you want to prevent high cholesterol here are some things you can do.You should have regular blood pressure and cholesterol checks with your doctor. Eat more fruit and vegetables and wholegrain foods Eat less fatty foods Eat fish twice a week including oily fish If you smoke, try to stop Be a healthy weight Be more physically active for at least  minutes  days a week Drink less alcohol Learn to relax, de-stress – take time out for yourself.Comment MORE ON Blood pressureHeart attackHeart diseaseFitnessCholesterol\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Iaposm back to square one, basically, she said. I felt pretty deflated, but I suppose this is le. Itaposs been a bit of a journey really. Itaposll be a relief to get the scaffolding down and then Iaposll be able to resurrect my garden.  Ms Chamberlain said scaffolding was put up around her home in early October, with alterations to be made to external pipework and building materials put in her front and back gardens. By the end of the month I was told that the project had ended, she continued. God knows how much government money has been wasted in the process. Ms Chamberlain was due to have external wall insulation for free after she successfully applied for a Green Homes Grant, a scheme funded by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The grants have been handed out and the work is being carried out in phases. Ms Chamberlain applied for a grant in March, but she claims E.On said they would be unable to finish the work before a deadline at the end of October. The company said this was due to the fact they were trying to complete work for as many homes as possible in the window after applications closed on March . E.On said they had apologised to Ms Chamberlain and would remove the building materials and fix the pipework as a matter of urgency. A spokesperson told NottinghamshireLive: Unfortunately it wasn’t possible to complete the external wall insulation at this property under the government-led Green Homes Grant Local Authority Delivery scheme before this phase of it closed. We have made the council’s local co-ordinator for this work across Nottinghamshire aware of this case so the insulation can be completed within a future phase of the scheme.” Ms Chamberlain said that she believed she was not the only homeowner to fall foul of the timeout. E.On said they have provided  energy efficiency measures to  Nottinghamshire households at a government-funded cost of £,.

The Prince of Wales was greeted by crowds of people as he left a branch of NatWest bank in Brixton, south London, after an engagement for the Princeaposs Trust on Thursday. One man asked him: Prince Charles. How is your mother  The heir to the throne gave him an encouraging pat on the arm, and appeared to say: Sheaposs alright, thank you. The Queen, , has been under doctorsapos orders to rest during the past three weeks after undergoing medical tests and spending a night in hospital on October . She has ed to Windsor Castle on Tuesday after spending six days at Sandringham, where she was believed to have been preparing to welcome her family for Christmas. She conducted a Privy Council meeting by video link from the castle on Wednesday afternoon, with ministers including Lord President of the Council Jacob Rees-Mogg and Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi among others.The -year-old monarch is understood to be feeling refreshed after spending time at her later husband Prince Philipaposs former home, Wood Farm on the vast Sandringham estate. Though the monarch has said she will miss the annual Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday, Buckingham Palace has said it is her firm intention to be at the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph. However, her attendance has yet to be confirmed. The Queen is commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces and has only ever missed six Remembrance Sunday services in the capital, four due to royal tours and two when she was pregnant.  The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are expected to lead other members of the royal family on Saturday at the annual remembrance event at the Royal Albert Hall. This would include the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Earl and Countess of Wessex and the Princess Royal. Her Majesty has been told to ease up on her hectic schedule after she was last month forced to spend a night in hospital, with specialist doctors at the King Edward VII hospital in Marylebone, London, performing a series of tests described as “preliminary investigations”.  She was forced to cancel a two day trip to Northern Ireland at the last minute as well as a planned appearance at the COP climate change conference last week. Courtiers are understood to be working towards managing the Queen’s diary accordingly for the next few weeks leading up to Christmas, while she will continue to undertake light duties at Windsor Castle. In a statement, Buckingham Palace said: Following on from their recent advice that the Queen should rest for a few days, Her Majestyaposs doctors have advised that she should continue to rest for at least the next two weeks.  The doctors have advised that Her Majesty can continue to undertake light, desk-based duties during this time, including some virtual audiences, but not to undertake any official visits. The monarch has recently been spotted used a walking stick for the first time on royal visits. Despite any recent medical wobbles, the monarch is said to be “totally committed” to entertaining her loved ones at her Norfolk home after missing out last year because of the pandemic. But royal sources said she is determined to recover soon so she can see her family at their traditional festive gathering. Last year restrictions meant the Queen and the late Prince Philip had a quiet Christmas alone at Windsor Castle. But after losing her husband of  years in April, it is understood Her Majesty really wants to see everyone together. A Palace insider said: “This year, more than ever, it is incredibly important to Her Majesty to be surrounded by her loved ones. “The Queen is totally committed to hosting everyone as she hopes to make it back to full health in the coming weeks. “Her Majesty is resting under doctors’ orders with the intention of being able to fully enjoy the company of her extended family over the holiday period.

John Woodsapos -year-old daughter, Carly, had been playing outside with her friends and brothers and was her aposnormal happy selfapos the day before she felt unwell. She was taken to hospital after she started to feel worse and doctors gave her family a devastating diagnosis - she had a rare form of liver cancer.Her liver was four times larger than it should have been and it was ram packed and stuffed with multiple tumours, John, , told the Liverpool Echo. Carly, whose family lives in Skelmersdale, died on November  at Alder Hey Childrenaposs Hospital.  John, who lives in with his partner, Kelly [Carlyaposs mum], and their children, said: She woke up on the Sunday morning and said, aposdad, Iaposve got a belly acheapos. I was putting clothes away and I just said, wellyouaposre trying to get out of school Iaposm still sending you. It was her first year in senior school and she was having a bit of trouble settling in. I thought she was trying to play on it. As the day went on she was moaning a little bit more and I asked her what sheaposd had for her breakfast this morning. She said she wasnapost really hungry. I said youaposve probably got hunger pains, get downstairs and Iaposll do you your dinner.  I did her something to eat but she didnapost really eat much of it. It got to bed time and she was whimpering a little bit so Kelly just gave her some Ibuprofen. Kelly come back in the bedroom and said I think she might have appendicitis. I said weaposll see how she gets on tomorrow morning. At five oaposclock in the morning, my partner wakes me and says can you take the day off and watch the baby, Iaposm going to take her to the hospital. Carly was taken to Ormskirk Hospital where she underwent scans and tests. Appendicitis was ruled out but the parents were told their daughteraposs liver was bigger than it should be and doctors didnapost understand the reason why. Carly was in hospital for four days undergoing more tests until she was eventually transferred to Alder Hey. It was there that further scans prompted doctors to break some devastating news to her parents. John said: I was called into the office and the doctor told me that straight away they could see on the ultrasound her liver was four times larger than it should be and it was just ram packed and stuffed with multiple tumours. John said the news left them in shock but worse was to come as further tests showed that the cancer had spread to the little girlaposs lungs.  Carly had been diagnosed with a rare type of liver cancer called aposhepatocellular neoplasm not otherwise specied HC-NOSapos. John said: They said they only see one or two of these cancers each year and normally thereaposs some sort of pre-warning, usually the kid has been in hospital or been sick before. Doctors told the parents they would need to administer an invasive and experimental form of chemotherapy immediately to rid Carlyaposs lungs of tumours before she would be able to have a liver transplant. Surgery was performed to prepare Carly for the chemotherapy by inserting a line in the side of her neck, but afterwards doctors were having trouble bringing her around. After she eventually woke up, Carlyaposs parents were told they would have to get her salt levels higher before they could administer the treatment and so the parents went home for the night.  The next day, a doctor called them both back into the hospital. John said: We went back in on the Sunday morning and they told us there was medically nothing they could do. Her liver was pretty much clapped out and not ing. She wouldnapost physically be able to take the chemotherapy, it would be too cruel. They told us that we would have to make the decision to not resuscitate her and just keep her comfortable and let her pass. Carly lived for another week before she died, surrounded by her loving parents, on November . John said: I think for both of us itaposs not even sunk in yet. Iaposm still numb. The only thing thataposs getting me through it is making it [Carlyaposs funeral] the best day possible for her.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

The grieving dad said the thing thataposs giving them comfort at this time, is knowing that samples taken from Carly may help other children. John added: I hope Carlyaposs memory and story will be seen by thousands and her sacrice will potentially save thousands of familyaposs from the same heart ache and fate in the future.

Raihan Ahmed, , was driving mph in a mph zone across a bridge in Birmingham’s Digbeth district on August . The stolen caraposs wheels at one point left the ground before landing on the other side of the bridge, smashing into -year-old former bus driver and father-of-four Ghulam Nabi, who died of his injuries.Police have released the CCTV video clips, which show Ahmed fleeing the scene at high speed before abandoning the car, BirminghamLive reports. Ahmed, of Great Barr, was arrested just  hours later following a successful appeal by the police and jailed for three-years and eight months.  He has been banned from driving for four years and ten months. The family of the victim, Mr Nabi, agreed for police to release the footage to warn drivers over the dangers of speeding. West Midlands Police detective Paul Hughes, of the forceaposs serious collision investigation unit said, “Mr Nabi was a totally innocent party in this matter and, as a pedestrian, should have been afforded safety on the pavement.  Ahmed was driving at such a speed on a public road and, in a specically restricted speed limit, that the loss of control on the bridge resulted in all four wheels leaving the road. “Itaposs always a dficult decision to release footage from such tragic cases - however this is some of the worse driving I have seen in a long time. “By releasing footage, with the support of Mr Nabi’s family, I hope it will make people think again about the responsibility they carry when driving.

The mum, , shares a bed with her son, , and daughter, aged  months, because she doesnapost want her son to be scared at night.She first moved into the property with her son in , reports MyLondon.It was a fresh start for the family, after she fled a violent partner and was homeless.Do you have a similar story  Email webnews@mirror.  However in , she claims she was handed a letter by Clarion Housing explaining she must leave because the entire building was extremely dangerous. She said: I received a letter saying I needed to decamp, the building is extremely dangerous - a housing officer promised me that we would get support. A lot of the tenants were tricked into homes because they were non-English speakers, they didnapost understand the process. They were worried they’d be out on the streets, and now I’m the last one here. The process is by being placed into temporary accommodation or permanent housing found by Clarion. However, the mum is refusing to move into the permanent and temporary accommodation previously offered by Clarion because she fears she will be living in temporary housing with her kids for years. What Clarion do is they lie, they cheat people and put them in temporary accommodation and just leave them there for years - rotting, she alleged. Because the mum rejected Clarionaposs options of living in a crime ridden estate nearby and out of borough in Walthamstow, Clarion served her a notice of possession orderlast March. She says she was horried when a senior housing officer reportedly told her in a later meeting: Itaposs social housing, what do you expect  While suffering a miscarriage a few weeks ago, the mum was notied by Clarion that they will be taking her to court because the six-month notice of their possession order period had ended. She believes Clarion is responsible for her recent miscarriage at nine-and-a-half weeks, and wants to sue them for violating her human rights. Breaking down in tears, the mum said: I was so happy when I moved in - now Iaposm in a really bad state. I don’t want to live in a squalor now, I just don’t want to be living like this. It’s my fourth Christmas stuck here, for New Years we’ll be stuck here - everyone  apart from Clarion tenants will be enjoying themselves. I’m just here on my own, it’s crazy, no neighbours, no one to look out for you, it’s just awful. She claims the communal hallways now reek of urine and gone-off food because no maintenance staff have tended to the building since . While faulty fire alarms means the family are often woken up past midnight to the sound of extremely loud fire alarms. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information and changes at www.mirror email .On one occasion, firefighters had to break a door down with a crowbar because they couldnapost get in. She also no longer receives post, including vital food vouchers for her toddler. There’s hardly any food in the house, I’m really, really struggling, the mum said. She continued: It’s really hard, everywhere you turn to, they should be safeguarding us, they just turn your back on you - whether it’s the councillor, the local MP, Citizens Advice Bureau, HSC, Environmental Health - they just send emails here and there, things are going round in circles, but nothingaposs being done. It’s really depressing, it’s had a really bad impact on my physical health, I’ve had a miscarriage now because of all of this stress. I don’t sleep at night, I don’t eat. I’m a zombie because I’m working all day. I’ve got a baby that’s  months old who’s sick, I’m on my own and people just don’t have any regard. Inside the two-bed flat, the mum says itaposs extremely stuffy with little air because the windows have never opened very far, while a mice infestation is re. Itaposs taken a toll on the womanaposs teenage son too, who suffers from thalassemia, a blood cell disorder that produces less haemoglobin than usual - causing fatigue and brittle bones. Describing her sonaposs patience, she says: My son has stopped asking me about our situation now as he’s seen how it’s affected me. He sees that and knows it hurts me. He’s a good boy and doesn’t pressurise me much. He says, aposmum don’t worry, we’re not always going to live like this, I promise you I’ll study hard and I’ll get you out of hereapos. Since the pandemic hit, the mum says her housing situation has gone out of control, itaposs also been a struggle to maintain her hair and beauty business - a business sector that was hit hard by Covid-. I’m not expecting luxury like Kensington and Cha, I just want a normal house where me and my kids can heal, she adds. A Clarion spokesperson said: When Lemon Tree House was determined as unsafe in , we worked closely with all residents to find them suitable alternative accommodation. We have offered the resident a number of suitable properties, including both temporary and permanent options. The safety and wellbeing of our residents is our number one priority and there are approved fire safety measures in place in the building. We remain committed to working with the resident to find a permanent home.

At first glance it looks like a little outbuilding and you wouldnapost expect it to be a house. But the one-bed property in Notting Hill is deceptively small from the outside - similar to Doctor Whoaposs police box Tardis which is actually huge on the inside. And once the lucky owner has entered the building, theyaposll find a surprisingly roomy maisonette over two floors. It has been designed to maximise the space available and both the bedroom and kitchen are slimmer than a London bus. A little living room is the first ting prospective buyers will encounter when they come through the door, complete with a cosy sofa and widescreen TV.  Shelves help maximise the space without bulky furniture. And next to that is sleek, modern kitchen, with hob laid fitted microwave at head height.It is being marketed by Homesite, Notting Hill, on Rightmove aposs property site.The owner, in the fashionable area, has built a breakfast bar below a window. A skylight above, meanwhile, allows plenty of sunshine in and makes the room look bigger.  Agents Homesite say the property is based in Powis Mews, where homes can fetch £.million, and they say it has much to recommend it. The brochure states: Itaposs located a stoneaposs throw away from the market, boutiques and cafes of Portobello Road and Westbourne Grove. Sliding doors take the viewer to the little bedroom which measures just ft in across compared to a Routemaster bus which is ft in wide.  A double bed is lit by pendant-style lightbulbs which shine above the mattress The current owner has not cluttered the home with furniture and instead relies on built-in wardrobes and shelving. The estate agent adds: The apartment has a modern fully fitted kitchen with brand new Siemens appliances. The ground floor level benefits from high ceilings, large sash windows, a skylight and bespoke carpentry with a feature spiral staircase.  The lower ground level consists of a study area with built in wardrobes, a separate bedroom area and family bathroom that has been finished to an exceptional standard. The capital is well-known for its creative solutions to maximise space. One trendy flat in an upscale postcode is on the market for a knock-down price, it was on for a rental price of£ a week. It boasted a large shower, opposite the kitchenette, but there was no toilet to be seen.  Elsewhere, a double room in Finsbury, in north of the city, was on the market for £ a month, but the new tenant had no bedroom It provided a mattress beneath its eaves, with a hammock slung nearby There was also a large garden and a movie room set up. But any renter will need to share with more than  other people, as well as three cats.

She said she regained consciousness in the toilets of the venueHattie Brown has described regaining consciousness in a night club toilets to find a human bite mark on her arm Image: BPM MEDIAByKaty KeighleyChiara Fiorillo:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsA teenager who was claimed she was spiked at a nightclub found a human bite mark on her arm when she regained consciousness. Hattie Brown said she felt really confused during a night out during which she suffered memory loss. The student at Exeter University said when she regained consciousness in the toilets of the venue, she noticed she had been bitten.She told Devon Live : Somehow I lost my friends, I looked around for them, but I don’t remember finding them.I then have a complete memory gap and I remember waking up, or regaining consciousness in the toilets, with my back up against the door.  I was really confused. I looked down at my arm and there were teeth indentations. I saw that I had been bitten by a human and I was really confused because I’ve never really heard of that happening before. I’m assuming that I must have been spiked because I don’t understand how I could have gone from being pretty much sober to having complete memory loss, and how I would have been bitten that hard on the arm without feeling it. She added: It’s one of those things where you will just never understand what was going through the mind of that person and how it happened. Part of me doesn’t want to know what happened, and I’ve kind of accepted that I won’t, but it’s so bizarre.  The -year-old said she is still suffering with bruising, swelling and pain two days later. However, she does not want this experience to stop her from going clubbing in the future and instead wants to warn others hoping it will help them stay safe on nights out. She shared her story on TikTok, gaining over , views, telling people to stay with your mates, let your mates know where you are and where you’re going.  Earlier this month, a university student said she collapsed in an AE waiting room after being allegedly spiked by injection at a nightclub. Amy Taylor said her legs felt fuzzy and her arm was bruised while she started feeling unconscious. The alleged incident happened at Fab aposNapos Halloween Guild of Students club night on October , Birmingham Live reports.The third-year human biology student said she noticed a puncture wound on her arm after being helped into an Uber to AE.

Thomas Markle slammed his daughter following revelations from her then press secretary Jason Knauf that she was aware about the book Finding Freedom. The Duchess of Sussex said she had not remembered emails between her and Mr Knauf despite a spokesperson for the Sussexes insisting they did not collaborate with the authors on the book, nor were they interviewed for it In a damning interview on GB News on Thursday evening, he claimed: I cant speak to much about this but I think she was trying to deceive.  I think she was telling lies. Finally the truth is coming out and thank god for Jason Knauf. I would like him to come over so I can take him out for a steak. Meghan has apologised in a new witness statement, where she accepted that Mr Knauf did brief the authors of Finding Freedom with Meghanaposs knowledge. She said: I apologise to the Court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time. I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the Defendant or the Court.  The Duchess added that had she known about the emails she would have been more than happy to refer to them as strongly supportive of her case.In the interview Thomas claimed Meghan had demanded he stopped talking to his two older children and that she had ghosted her family from both sides after marrying Prince Harry.Meghan has claimed that her two older half-siblings Samantha and Thomas had said hurtful things about her in the past.  The interview this evening comes as the Associated Newspapers Limited - the publishers of the Mail on Sunday - appeals against a summary judgement given earlier this year. Meghan had sued the company over five articles that reproduced parts of a personal and private letter sent to her dad in August . The High Court ruled ANLaposs publication of Meghanaposs letter to her father was unlawful, meaning there was no need for a trial. Mr Markle last appeared on British TV screens at the end of October when he was interviewed on Good Morning Britain.  The show was subsequently hit with a  Ofcom complaints by viewers unhappy that he had sounded off about his estranged daughter once again. The Duchess of Sussex has been the subject of a number of cutting remarks from her father and he also tore into Prince Harryaposs new tell-all book, which he branded shameful.  During the attack on the Sussexes Thomas claimed he was being ghosted by Meghan and has vowed to continue to publicly attack his daughter until she begins speaking to him again. I think Harry has abandoned the Queen, the royal family, the British people and the Army. Heaposs abandoned them all, he said on GMB. I’ve made it quite clear until I hear from her until she does speak to me that I’ll continue to do this.  I will do a show for at least a monthI can get it through and eventually sooner or later she should start talking to me - this is way too childish. This is kind of silly. It’s time to talk with each other. We’re family. At one point the retired lighting director said heaposd considered taking legal action in a bid to see his grandchildren, Archie and Lilibet. Some viewers found that suggestion galling. Thereaposs something quite tone deaf about Thomas Markle, one person wrote on social media. Surely youaposd know that your daughter has cut you off because you keep bashing her to the press  How can you be that unaware  The last time Mr Markle went on GB News was back in August this year.  He was asked by Wootton for his response to Meghanaposs comments about him, regarding the infamous paparazzi pictures he staged with an agency before her wedding. The Duchess had, in an interview with Oprah, implied her dad had intentionally caused her pain with the photos. My first response is whataposs going to happen to these children  her dad said. I donapost know what terrible things are going to happen to these children because I did some photos, I donapost know what theyaposre talking about, what Harry is talking about, he kept saying apos you do that only one kid will be protectedapos, not two, I donapost know what heaposs talking about. Why am I being picked on  It seems Iaposm very easily picked on.

The woman claims she was trapped with a driver in a queue on the M when she felt the car “shaking” and heard a “rubbing noise” before she asked him “are you masturbating”. The driver didn’t respond, she said. Feeling uncomfortable, she alleged she got out of the car to seek the help of a nearby police officer. But she says the officer told her he found her claim “very doubtful” and when she askedhe doubted her he simply ‘shrugged his shoulders’. The incident is now being investigated by Greater Manchester Police’s professional standards branch. The force has also apologised for “any instances whereby a member of the public has not received a good service from us”. Uber says they have suspended the driver’s account while an investigation takes place. The woman - who spoke to the Manchester Evening News and has not been named - requested an Uber to take her home from a work event in Manchester city centre just after pm on Thursday night last week.She was sitting in the back seat behind the driver, she said, when the car ground to a halt as they neared a police road closure around the site of an accident. So I was waiting in the taxi trying to chat to the driver and he was a bit grumpy. I put my rucksack on the seat next to me to rest my head,” she said. I noticed the car started shaking and I could hear this rubbing noise. I asked aposwhat are you doing apos. This went on and it stopped and started. I moved to the middle seat to try and distract him and tried to talk to him, asking how long he thought we would be here. I wanted him to stop. I text my husband and said aposIaposm fairly confident the driver of this Uber is masturbatingapos. He phoned me and said to put him on the phone but I didnapost want the driver to take my phone. There was a bit of this starting and stopping and the car shaking and the rubbing noise. I never actually saw his penis, buthe was not doing that he certainly wanted me to think he was. I said aposIaposm getting outapos and asked aposAre you masturbatingapos and he didnapost respond. The woman says she got out of the car onto the motorway and approached a nearby police officer. She explained the situation but was told she needed to get back inside her vehicle. He asked which car it was and started walking me back to the car, she says. I told him I wasnapost getting back in that taxi and he said aposyouaposre going to have to because you canapost stand out in the carriagewayapos. The woman says the officer then aposreluctantlyapos agreed to let her sit in the back of the police car. When she asked what their plan was she was told the officer could drop her at a shopping centre many miles from her home. She was there for around  minutes before anyone spoke to her properly, she says. Sometime later, she says another officer arrived and askedshe would like them to arrest the Uber driver. “I said ‘yeah’,” she says. “They askedI could identy him and I told them the name and car was on my Uber app. I told him what had happened and he told me this case was unlikely to get a prosecution. They had not even taken my name at that point. “By then I was more worried about how I would get home. I said ‘okay, leave it’. Then the first officer came over tomy phone and said ‘I find it very doubtful that a man would do this whilst he knows he’s trapped in the traffic’. “I said ‘are you telling me this didn’t happen’ and he just shrugged his shoulders and passed me the phone.” The woman says officers dropped her at McDonald’s, in Hattersley, where her husband had ordered her a cab home. She has since reported both the alleged crime and her complaint about officers’ conduct. They said there would be an investigation and I would get a written outcome,” she says. In my opinion that is quite a dangerous officer because he is not only inept and didnapost take a report, but he also tried to get me back in the taxi,” she added. From that driveraposs perspective heaposs seen me go to the police and seen them try to put me back in his car. If I had not been so insistent I could have ended back in that Uber. And someone  with perhaps less le experience might have. It was a sex crime. I was in a position where I was vulnerable, I told a police officer and you think they would at least get you home safe. A spokesperson for the Greater Manchester Police force said: Firstly, we completely acknowledge the effect incidents of this nature can have on victims, and we are sorry for any instances whereby a member of the public has not received a good service from us. Our job as police officers is to keep the public safe. We want all members of our community, especially women and girls, to feel they are not at risk of harm when going about their daily lives in Greater Manchester and we are working with partners across Greater Manchester to better achieve this. We can confirm that GMP has received a complaint regarding the police response to this incident which is in the process of being assessed by our Professional Standards Branch. “As a result it would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time. An Uber spokesperson said: We are appalled by this allegation and have a zero tolerance policy on any such behaviour in the Uber community. “In this case the driveraposs account has been suspended while an investigation takes place.” Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Greater Manchester PoliceAppsPolice carShopping centresCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Twin Curtis Means, who is now a healthy -month-old, was delivered in Birmingham, Alabama, in the US, last year weighing just g .The average weight of a newborn is around . lb , while a full-term pregnancy is usually  weeks. Guinness World Records has now confirmed that Curtis, who was  days - nearly  weeks - premature, set the new record. His mother, Michelle Butler, scrambled to get to the hospital after being into labour on July  , amid Independence Day celebrations.  Michelle gave birth to twins, Curtis and C’Asya, at lunchtime the next day. Little C’Asya tragically died a day later. However, Curtis beat the odds, clinging on in intensive care. Dr Brian Sims, who was the attending physician, said statistically, children born as young as the twins had virtually no chance of survival. In a statement from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, which operates the hospital, Dr Sims said doctors typically advised “compassionate care” in situations of extremely preterm births.  This allows the parents to hold their babies and cherish what little time they may have together.”But instead, Curtis grew stronger by the day and was thriving,the BBC reported.He received help from therapists to learn to breathe and to use his mouth to eat, and after  days, was eventually taken off a ventilator and discharged from hospital.  Mrs Butler, of rural Eutaw, Alabama, said in a statement: Being able to finally take Curtis home and surprise my older children with their younger brother is a moment I will always remember. While Curtis, the youngest of four, still needs supplemental oxygen and a feeding tube, doctors say he is in good health. Dr Sims, who oversaw the delivery, told Guinness World Records: Iaposve been doing this almost  years, but Iaposve never seen a baby this young be as strong as he was. There was something special about Curtis. Curtis cut a whole  hours off the previous record. Wisconsin baby Richard Hutchinson was born just a month prior, at  weeks and two days. The record had remained unbroken before Richard’s birth for  years, with the previous record holder being a baby boy born in Ottawa, Canada, at  weeks and five days.

The Duchess of Sussex, , smiled for the cameras as she glided across the red carpet in New York City. Meghan appeared in a flowing long dress at this year’s Salute to Freedom Gala at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum. She was holding hands with her husband Harry, , who looked dashing wearing a dinner jacket, bow tie and military medals. But just hours earlier - and some , miles away - the Court of Appeal in London had learned more about the writing of the bestseller Finding Freedom.  A statement from Meghan, read to the court, claimed emails between her then press secretary Jason Knauf about a meeting with the authors of the book, Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, had slipped her mind. In a statement, Mr Knauf noted that Meghan and Harry authorised specic cooperation in writing in December . He had advised the couple that putting the authors in touch with Meghanaposs friends was not a good idea, emails show. Being able to say hand on heart that we did not facilitate access will be important, he told the pair. A witness statement from Meghan then said she accepted that Mr Knauf did brief the authors of Finding Freedom - with her knowledge. She said: I apologise to the Court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time.  I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the Defendant or the Court. The Duchess added that had she known about the emails she would have been more than happy to refer to them as strongly supportive of her case. Last year a spokesperson for the couple said they did not collaborate with the authors on the book, nor were they interviewed for it, OK reports. Despite the dayaposs revelations, the pair put on a united front on the red carpet. When a reporter asked Meghanshe was proud of Prince Harry, she replied: Iaposm always proud of him.  Harry later joked in a speech at the event that he is now living the American Dream. He said: “It’s wonderful to be back on USS Intrepid a decade after my last visit – and a lot has changed since then. Just last week, I went for a ride on the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile – how’s that for living the American dream. Each year the museum pays tribute to people in the military who have shown “extraordinary leadership” and honours the roles they have played to defend their country.  Harry continued: I’ve lived in the US for close to two years now. I have to say, witnessing your support for all those that put themselves in harm’s way in defence of our freedoms and liberties – it’s remarkable and hugely respected. “It reminds me of the deep reverence us Brits have for our military as well. The armed forces communities in both our countries share a special bond, and I’m grateful to have served in support of our joint allyship for many years.” Meghan was wearing a red Carolina Herrera dress and red shoes to match the high-slit fashion choice. She had her long locks up into a high bun. Harry had a line of four medals on his jacket along with the cross for Knight Commander of Royal Victorian Order around his neck. Palace rules mean Harry can wear medals on his jacket but was stripped of his titles after deciding to leave for the US. He was reportedly particularly upset to have the rank of Captain General of the Royal Marines taken from him. As they moved along the red carpet, it was Harry who appeared more keen to stop and chat. He was overheard to ask one person: Are you excited  Then a reporter asked him: Howaposs your grandmother  He smiled and nodded before moving on.  The Sussexes, parents to Archie, two, and five-month-old Lilibet, were both wearing a poppy. The event is held ahead of Veterans Day in the US and Remembrance Day in the UK. Harry is a special guest at the event where he will give out medals for the Intrepid Valor Awards to five service members, veterans and military families who are living with the “invisible wounds of war”. The event is particularly relevant for Harry who himself had a military background before leaving the Royal Family and moving to Calornia.  He served in the military for  years including two tours of Afghanistan and has been working with veterans as well as founding the Invictus Games - a sporting event for wounded for ex-servicemen. Harry and Meghan have been dedicating their time to charity work and humanitarian initiatives since moving to the US. Also at the veteransapos event was Jon Bon Jovi who collaborated with Harry to release a song for the Invictus Games and he received the  Intrepid Letime Achievement Award for his work as chairman of the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation.We are so grateful to Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex for honouring and amplying the stories of these heroes and helping to raise awareness for mental health support for our men and women in unorm, said Susan Marenoff-Zausner, president of the Intrepid Museum. This is their second trip to New York this year having attended the Global Citizen Live concert in Manhattan in late September. Harry has spoken out recently about the trolling of Meghan online, including over the decision by the couple to leave the UK for the US that became dubbed “Megxit”. He reportedly told the Wired’s Re:Wired Conference on Tuesday that the “term ‘Megxit’ was or is a misogynistic term and it was created by a troll, amplied by royal correspondents and it grew and grew and grew into mainstream media.”  Meghan meanwhile has said she is now feeling much better after admitting she suffered suicidal thoughts while pregnant with son Archie. The Duchess of Sussex was speaking to host Andrew Ross Sorkin at the New York Times DealBook Summit where she said stepping back from royal duties has lead to an improvement in her mental health. Mr Sorkin said there was a moment when a lot of the world was concerned and wondering about the comments she made. Meghan told an interview with Oprah Winfrey earlier this year, she had suicidal thoughts while a member of the Royal Family living in the UK.  She also alleged racism by a royal who asked her what would be the colour of her child when she was pregnant for the first time. She responded to the host that she was now feeling “better about everything. Just days ago royal biographer Andrew Morton revealed the Oprah interview was planned years in advance, shortly after the Sussexes got married. The Sussexesapos rt with the Royal Family led to them moving to the United States last year and since then they have spoken regularly to American media about problems they allege forced them to leave.

For most of us, that boils down to sneaking in our own snacks, in a bid to stop a trip to the cinema from becoming prohibitively expensive. But for some risk-takers, it appears that they use their time during the film for X-rated acts - which is strictly forbidden. Now one cinema worker has gone viral after revealing how staff members can see exactly whataposs going on in the theatre. And it isnapost pretty. TikTok user @.noheadache went viral after sharing a video where she admitted sheaposs constantly having to look away from the CCTV screen because of some coupleaposs outrageous behaviour.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Zooming in on the screen showing all the cinema rooms, she explained: “When people come to the cinema with their sneaky link to do the nasty.” The video, which has racked up more than  million views, is captioned: “We see everything.” The worker explained further in the comments: “We also have night vision goggles so we’ve seen it all.” In the comments, one user explained: Theyaposre for anti-piracy.

She said that corners are cut when it comes to cleaning, and that staff donapost give a s**t about the free fried breakfast that is offered by many hotels, as Birmingham Live reports.She said ingredients get reused and cooking equipment isnapost properly cleaned, but instead is just wiped down each day - leaving the dirt and grime to build up.  What do you think about cheap hotel breakfasts  Let us know in the comments...In her video, Brandi said: I don’t know how to say this without being attacked by people in the industry...your hotel serves the hot continental breakfast, eggs, waffles stuff like that, don’t eat that s***. That waffle batter gets reused until it starts to smell like beer. Another gross thing Brandi recalled was being told by a manager to only use a single paper towel to clean everything all night. She explains: He said it was environmentally friendly instead of using a rag or a sponge or even mostly paper towels to clean things like bowls, spatulas, the tables.

Brandi saysyou do want to stay somewhere and eat breakfast, make sure the hotel employs a proper chef and has a hygienic kitchen. I’m just trying to save y’all a headache, she adds.

One viewer said: I have worked in the food industry for over  years. Mostly worked as a morning hotel chef or manager. The buffet eggs are a no-go. A second person, who claimed to work for a popular hotel, commented: Stick to the prepackaged foods, also check the room before you bring luggage in.

He then played the captured footage and was amazed as he watched the eerie scene unfold, with an unidentied flying object gliding through the sky with three bright lights beaming through the darkness. Logistics manager Matt then called his aviation buff dad who checked an online flight tracker and claimed there was aposno plane trafficapos in the sky at all - leaving him to questionit could be extraterrestrial le. What do you think about Mattaposs sighting  Let us know in the comments...Matt, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, said: I was sat with my friend and said aposblimey, I didnapost hear the doorbell go but Iaposve got an alert come upapos. I looked at the footage and played it back. It was silent. Three lights came from the sky and I thought it was really weird. Where itaposs come through the trees, itaposs come over the house opposite me then the footage captures it coming from right to left. It disappears over the top of woodland to the left of my house.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. It was a bit of a chilling feeling really - I thought aposoh my god, thataposs quite closeapos. I wonderedIaposd discovered something nobody knows anything about. When I showed Kevin he said aposjeez, that looks like a UFOapos.

But, in actual fact, around  percent of marriages end in orce, proving this is sadly not the case. It most instances you would assume itaposs impossible to tell whether the couple will go the distance, but according to a wedding photographer, the signs of future orce bells are a lot less subtle than youaposd think.Shayla Herrington recently took to TikTok to share the three signs that a marriage is doomed from the very beginning, according to a wedding photographer of more than  years, who shared their wisdom with her.Posting from the handle @shaylamherrington, Shayla explained: One time I was shooting under this wedding photographer, and they told me they can always tella couple will last or not, based on three things.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Mind you this photographer has been in the industry for  or  years, so I was really interested to hear their theory on this, she added. The first sign, Shayla explained, isone of the spouses takes more than three photos without their partner - which actually makes a lot of sense,you think about it. This one kinda makes sense to me, just because you might get a few with your mom and dad, but to kick them out of more than three photos, seems a little suspicious, she explained. The second indicator is the bridesmaids, or the groomsmen will avoid talking about the spouse when they are getting ready or doing toast or anything, which she explained typically means they donapost like the spouse. And finally, Shayla revealed that the third indicator the marriage will not last is when the couple spend more time with family and friends than with each other during the day. The photographer then questioned her followers over whether they believed these indicators to be true, and many shared their own experiences of weddings and orce. Yep. My ex-husband didnapost spend time with me at the wedding, and his groomsmen didnapost say hi to me at all, one TikTok user commented, while another added: It depends. My husband didnapost even MEET half my family until the wedding day so there wasnapost that relationship between him and my family.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Itaposs getting colder, darker and weaposre about to officially enter the period of Christmas parties. So fans of McDonald’s will be pleased to hear, there is a range of suitably festive items available from November  to revive you.We visited McDonaldaposs HQ in East Finchley for a sneak peek of the menu - prepared by their in-house chefs in the test kitchen. Hereaposs what we thought. The fast-food chain is introducing two new burgers with a Christmas influence- the Festive Stack and Festive Crispy Chicken.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here I started with the Festive Stack burger This burger contains two British and Irish beef patties with red onion relish, white cheese sauce, bacon, crispy onions, red onion, lettuce, cheddar cheese in a glazed brioche-style bun. Reminiscent of the sandwich you create on Boxing Day, surrounded by leftovers, the cheese sauce is a nice touch - while the chutney jazzes up the burger. The only downside was I didnapost really notice the crispy onions - but the red onion did prove a satisfying crunch. The Festive Crispy Chicken, meanwhile, is packed with a chicken breast fillet in a crispy coating with cranberry sauce, sage and onion mayo, bacon, red onion, lettuce, cheddar cheese in a glazed poppy and sesame seed bun. This is the Christmas winner - the cranberry sauce is nice and sweet, while the sage and onion mayonnaise means that it doesnapost feel cloying. Perfect for ordering at am after drinking all the shots at the annual work Christmas do. These both retail at £. on their own or £. as part of a meal. Treat yourself, itaposs Christmas. Next up were the cheese Melt Dippers, which are made with Camembert. Iaposm a big fan of the chainaposs mozzarella sticks, so had high expectations for these, and they were met. Carby, cheesy goodness - whataposs not to love  They could have been crunchier, but I expect most people to prefer the squidge. These came with a herby ketchup, which wasnapost remarkable, but provided some tang. Four dippers cost £., but you can go all out with Cheese Melt Dippers Sharebox for £.. Next up was the Festive Pie Theyaposve taken the classic hot crispy pie and filled it with mincemeat and custard. This was a winner, but could never replace the apple-pie shaped hole in my heart, as itaposs held with such esteem. But it is a fun festival treat - perfect with a cup of coffee to fuel you while shopping for presents. This will retail at £.. We wrapped things up with the Celebrations McFlurry Itaposs the festive chocolate box of choice for many families, mixed with ice cream. Whataposs not to love  Described as soft dairy ice cream, swirled with Maltesers clusters, Galaxy chocolate drops, Caramel pieces, Mars chewy pieces and Twix biscuits, eagle-eyed fans will notice there are no Bounty pieces.Whether thataposs controversial depends on your feelings - a recent survey showedof Brits claim itaposs their least-loved chocolate.McDonaldaposs has around , restaurants in the UK.You can use its store finder tool online to locate your nearest branch.

Amy Pierpoint is no stranger to having wacky, colourful hair dos, but the interior designer got more than she bargained for, after her subtle grey-blue do turned bright turquoise, matching her own hallway.Things started to go wrong for Amy due to a tinge of yellow which was left in her hair from a previous do, causing the blue-rinse to go an entirely dferent colour than expected. I just wanted a purpley kind of Mrs Slocombe-type blue rinse - an old lady kind of blue - I didnapost want a shocking turquoise,the -year-old explained. If Iaposd seen it on someone  I would have said aposah thataposs amazingapos but it just wasnapost me, it just wasnapost right. But, it wasnapost until Amy got home that she released her vibrant new hair do was a perfect match for her eye-catching hallway wall - and she was perfectly camouflaged against it. She said: It was only when my mum dropped me off, I went into the house and I walked down my hallway that I realised my hair was exactly the same colour and I camouflaged perfectly against the wall. I really wanted to like it but in my heart I knew it had got to go. I felt embarrassed going outside, which is such a stupid thing because I wear ridiculous clothes and this blue hairaposs fine [that I currently have]. Iaposm not embarrassed by this blue hair so why was I embarrassed by that  People look at me all the time, itaposs nothing new, but I was walking around town thinking aposplease donapost look at meapos. That hair colour was a step too far, I just didnapost feel myself.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Vintage-loving Amy, who is naturally a brunette, trims her hair at home and dyes it every six weeks using Revolution Beauty Rainbow Drops - this time opting for the shade Blue Rays, which she hoped would achieve an aposold lady-styleapos blue rinse. Amy said: Iaposve always done my hair myself. Iaposm a very thrty person soI can do it myself I will do. I cut and dye my own hair so I can save money. Iaposve done it for years and itaposs something that Iaposm perfectly capable of doing. Over the years Iaposve been pretty much every colour except green but because my style is pretty much , s and s - I will only do things that could have been done in those eras. My hair was a baby pink colour, then a really light mauve, then it was more purple, then I decided to try something dferent and go for blue. Iaposd taken the colour out with bleach and then put the blue on it but I think, even though my hair was virtually white-blonde, just the tinge of yellow in my hair made it more turquoise. Despite giving it a go for a week, Amy wasnapost a fan and used a deeper colour from the Revolution Beauty range to achieve the colour she wanted. Amy said: It stayed that colour about a week and then decided I needed to sort it as Iaposd had enough. All it took was just a hint of purple and I ended up with the Mrs Slocombe blue I wanted. It wasnapost the productaposs fault, it was mine. Even though itaposs another shade of blue itaposs within my comfort zone. I love the turquoise colour in my hallway, itaposs one of my favourite colours, just not on my head. A Revolution Beauty spokesperson said: We love Amyaposs new look and definitely agree any hair colour should feel % true to who she is.

Misty MurphaposAriens, , and her husband Bryce , have become homesteaders - self sufficiency experts - since moving into a remote Canadian forest  years ago. They spent a few years learning tips and tricks from rural-living relatives before buying land and building a cob house - a natural material made of clay, sand and straw for just ,.The former chefs, who have daughters Sage, seven, and Aurora, five, are almost entirely self-sufficient, cooking their meals on a wooden stove.  They get electricity from solar  and use rain and a well for water, while most food comes from their own cows, chickens and ducks, and their vegetable patch. The garden grows all the traditional orchard fruits and produces a iety of nuts and vegetables which they harvest on a weekly basis. The pair reckon their lives cost just ,a year to fund which is , CADless than the average four person household in their province. Misty, from Dundalk, Ontario, said: From the moment we met we instantly knew we wanted to live an alternative lestyle.  Bryceaposs grandmotheraposs cottage was so peaceful and we were constantly disappointed when we had to leave and go back to the city. Iaposve always suffered with intense migraines but when we moved to the countryside they started to become less and less frequent. Six-months after moving theyaposd stopped completely and Iaposm convinced it was the noise and the city environment which had been the cause of my discomfort.  Rural living immediately made sense to us, and the idea of being completely self sufficient was really appealing. The couple met while working as chefs in Hamilton, but quickly realised they werenapost suited to living in the big city. Instead they opted to follow a more rural path and began learning about le on a homestead.  After visiting Bryceaposs grandmotheraposs cob cottage in rural Durham for  weekends in a row, they eventually moved there in . They spent three years learning how to lead the homestead lestyle, before going out on their own and buying a piece of farm land in the local area. In , the couple purchased the land for , despite it being covered in rubbish and abandoned materials which they spent weeks clearing  It took Misty and Bryce four months to build their aposcobapos home. Every summer since the move, they have expanded and improved their home. Their daughters are home-schooled by Misty, and taught a traditional syllabus with the addition of key primal skills, animal care and building techniques. The children have grown up learning some key skills which they may not have learned at school.  To earn money, Misty and Bryce run a small catering business in the local community, but with no car, they get around by cycling, walking or travelling on horseback. Bryce claims the reason their family is financially stable despite their lack of consistent income is their low cost, self sufficient lestyle. Weaposve worked out over the years that our annual living costs amount to approximately , - and thataposs with raising two kids, he said.  We try to be as self sufficient as possible, farming and harvesting all the food we eat. We do get the occasional shopping delivery to the nearest road, but thataposs only for a very select range of essential items. I think the dference with our lestyle is not so much what we do, but why we do it.  Of course we do have to acquire money, but the focus of our day is finding the most sustainable and fulfilling way to live. Whereas most people are spending the majority of their time working to afford the necessities of le, we spend our time working to acquire these necessities directly. Granted its not a le for everyone, but it works for us, and, as a family, weaposve never been happier.

Pingu was underweight and dehydrated, forcing medics to fit him with a feeding tube. Harry Singh, who spotted the penguin on the beach at Birdlings Flat, to the south of Christchurch, said he initially thought he was a soft toy - and he did not move for an hour.Mr Singh told the BBC : First I thought ita soft toy, suddenly the penguin moved his head , so I realised it was real. He was walking with his we when he spotted Pingu, and worried that he might become a target for other animals after his long journey. He said: We did not want it to end up in a dogaposs or cataposs stomach. Mr Singh put in calls to penguin experts, who were baffled to discover Pingu was so far from his natural habitat. After being nursed back to full health, it is expected that Pingu will be released onto a nearby beach, where there are no dogs allowed. It is only the third time that an Adélie penguin has been found in New Zealand, with previous occasions dating back to  and . Experts will be carrying out work to find outthe latest instance is the result of a worrying change in the oceans. Otago University zoology professor Philip Seddon told: “All species of penguin are like marine sentinels … when they’re doing badly, they’re giving us an early signal – canaries in coalmines – an early signal that things are not good.He continued: I thinkwe started getting annual arrivals of Adélie penguins, weaposd go actually, somethingaposs changed in the ocean that we need to understand. More studies will give us more understanding where penguins go, what they do, what the population trends are like - theyaposre going to tell us something about the health of that marine ecosystem in general.

horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

I recall from distant student days a symposium in Glasgow University Union at which Norman MacCaig declared: ldquoEvery poet in Scotland is a Scottish nationalist: other eminent figures of the literary scene were also present, and certainly none of them raised a dissenting voice. That was more than half a century ago but I can think of precious few Scottish writers from that day to this who have not been overt supporters of independence.The association of our national literature with the cause of independence is not, as Sheila Wallace appears to think, a recent disreputable aberration, but a central fact of the entire field, particularly in the th and st centuries. Why  does she think generations of Scottish schoolchildren have been deliberately kept in ignorance of most of it :Why Scotland is the luckiest country in the worldDerrick McClure, Aberdeen.SCOTS MUSIC IS NOT NATIONALISTICCORRESPONDENCE from John Dunlopand Sheila Wallacedescribes alarm that Scottish music, poetry and literature is somehow spoiled and exploited by \"nationalists\".Our culture had been founded in a wild amalgamation of local and international influences. I play traditional music and the number of tunes that share Irish and Scottish roots is considerable.This music is not nationalistic, rather it is very local, with styles and repertoire changing from area to area. It is also international, shared by enthusiastic players across the globe.Allan McDougall, Neilston.TIME TO LOOK AT OUTSIDE FUNDINGOPPONENTS of self-government get worked up when celebrities have their tuppence worth, but far more insidious is people living outside Scotland spending large sums to secretly influence events in Scotland, normally by extreme right-wing organisations, and the Electoral Commission needs to clamp down on anonymous third-party funding in elections and referenda.For example, the recently published expenditure for Mayrsquos Scottish elections included pound, by the anti-independence grouping Scotland Matters, who were bankrolled to the extent of pound, by the unknown Centre for Economic Education and Training, which only has a London PO Box address with no record of who is a member or who is funding it and did not register with the Electoral Commission. A further pound, donation to Scotland Matters was from a London-based former Tory researcher, so the vast bulk of its funding was from outside Scotland.The same applies to the new Scotland Office minister, and Lords peer, Malcolm Offordrsquos so-called grass roots London-based No Borders organisation that spent pound, during the  referendum campaign and received pound, from Stalbury Trustees, which is based in England and whose stated company objects is ldquothe promotion of the Conservative Party.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh.IN SEARCH OF COMPROMISEWILLIE Macleanis quite mistaken to describe my position on a second referendum as being that future voters ldquoshould never have the opportunity to cast a vote on the independence question.On the contrary, as regular readers know, I have consistently argued for a New Act of Union that provides a unilateral route to secession, subject to a referendum based on best practice where . This is my reasonable suggestion for a compromise which respects the outcome of  vote and would ensure that independence would only happenit was the settled will of a clear majority.However, the concepts of ldquoreasonable and ldquocompromise are unrecognisable to the nationalist mindset.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.LITTLE HAS CHANGED SINCE THE SNP has never really got over its defeat in the  referendum.It is certainly worth noting that in the most recent Holyrood elections the number of votes cast for the SNP amounted to ,,, whilst the Conservative Labour Liberal Democrat voters added up to ,,. In percentage terms this is roughly a ratio of .   ., which is very close to the results in the independence referendum. So one can only conclude that nothing really much has changed ndash the majority of Scots still wish to remain in the UK.The recent agreement on the part of the SNP to come to a deal with the largely unelected Scottish Greens merely leads to a greater impasse, rather than any political advantage.One could well suggest that this is just another attempt to by the SNP to try to undermine the sound economy and political leadership of these islands. Scotlands future will be far safer politically, and economically,it continues as a constituent part of the UK.Robert IG Scott, Ceres, Fe.A BARON ARGUMENTDR Angus Macmillanrefers to the fact that the Labour Party has colluded with the system associated with appointments to the House of Lords for years. Who once said \"The House of Lords must go ndash not be reformed, not be replaced, not be reborn in some nominated le after-death patronage paradise, just closed down, abolished, finished\"  Answer: Neil Kinnock in  .What is he today  Answer: Baron Kinnock of Bedwellty.That just about says it all.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.EUROPE AGAINST NUCLEAR WEAPONSRETIRED Irish Defence Force Colonel Dorcha Lee writes that ldquoBelgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey are storing US nuclear weapons, without any public concern . Polling by ICAN, the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons, in four of the five countries Col Lee references, suggests otherwise.The publics in these four countries were askedthe US tactical nuclear weapons should be removed and responded in the affirmative as follows: Belgium %, The Netherlands %, Italy % and Germany %. Figures for Turkey are not available.These polls reveal that anti-nuclear sentiment, particularly amongst the original Western European members of Nato is considerable. It is another sign of Scotlandrsquos Western European political cultural alignment in general and that Scottish anti-nuclear sentiment is not some sort of outlier. It is Brexit Britain that is the real outlier.At its August conference the SNP passed a motion by more than  votes to  endorsing the earlier decision of all SNP parliamentarians to sign the ICAN parliamentary pledge that an independent Scotland would swtly sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weaponswhich came into force at the UN in January .The TPNW has  state signatories and so far  states have ratied it, a number that will grow by the time the TPNW has its CoP hosted by the Austrian Government in Vienna in March next year, an event that many of us in the civil society dimension of the anti-nuclear movement hope to attend.Bill Ramsay, Convener, SNP CND, Glasgow.A GOOD COP FOR FIRST MINISTERI ALWAYS enjoy Alison Rowats rapier-sharp wit, but\"Mr B Johnson of London\" has indeed left the comment she imagines, that Glasgow is a \"fab boltholeup to neck in sleaze row\", Mr Johnson, with sleaze now over his head, will find it well-nigh impossible to rise above it, whether in Glasgow or anywhere  . And although hed ditched the plane on histo the climate conference, his arrival as he alighted from the train was greeted with less than enthusiasm from the reception committee it wasnt just the gap Boris Johnson had to mind.However, even more of an irritant to Mr Johnson must be the high profile Scotlands First Minister has achieved at the conference. Mr Johnson infamously told the Scottish Tories he didnt want Nicola Sturgeon \"anywhere near it\", although he had to do a U-turn on that, given that Nicola Sturgeon is First Minister of the country where the conference is taking place. Then there was the Tory MP alleging that the three objectives at COP were \"Save the planet. Save the country. And stop Sturgeon getting a photo with Biden\". That one didnt go well for Mr Johnson either.As for the overall verdict on the conference, Ms Rowat is right to sum it up as \"jury out\". But whether it has been a good COP, a bad COP, or a Cop-out, only time will tell. The problem is that the planet doesnt have time.Ruth Marr, Stirling.Read more: Labour cannot win while it rides the Lords gravy train"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13195617.jpg?type=article-full","title":"brian-cox-i-used-think-scots-nats-joke","story":"ldquoI used to think the Scots Nats were a joke party,\" he said, in an interview in tomorrows Herald Magazine.Cox had voiced Labour election broadcasts in , the year Tony Blair came to power but was appalled by Blairrsquos decision to invade Iraq.

Thinking of it still makes me laugh.\"Condolences to all the family, friends and fans.\"Rest in peace Gwyneth, it was a pleasure to know, work and learn from you.\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmAs schoolchildren across the county gear up for the annual Children In Need fundraising activities, Papdale Primary School has a special plan in store for its business manager.

As of this evening  pupils have been confirmed as COVID-positive, along with five members of staff. A further four members of staff have recorded positive lateral flow test results.As a result, the nursery has been forced to close entirely, while four primary classes will remain home.The classes to close from Monday to Wednesday are: PM, PE. Classes PE and PM are to close on Monday only at this time. Online learning will be offered to affected pupils.According to a statement released by OIC, this evening, the situation will remain under daily review andthe position changes, parents and staff will be updated.The remainder of classes at Papdale Primary School will be open on Monday as usual.James Wylie, OIC’s executive director of education, leisure and housing said: “Staff have been working tirelessly over the last week to try and ensure Papdale Primary and Nursery were able to remain open in full, however, this has now reached the point where it is simply no longer possible. There are several factors for this including staff reporting positive PCR test results, being contact traced by Public Health, and the supply teaching staff list having been exhausted.“We realise that this may cause childcare issues for working parents and that is partly why we will keep the closures to an absolute minimum and monitor and manage the situation on a daily basis, ensuring that the settings are able to reopen once it is safe to do so with the appropriate staffing levels in place. It is also vital that we keep our educational facilities open whenever possible for the learning of our children, who have already missed out on so much these past  months of the pandemic.“I, again, take this opportunity to thank our staff, parents and pupils for the way in which we all continue to manage these situations, which are challenging for everyone. We must all continue to do our bit to try and stem the transmission of the virus, which is undoubtedly here for some time to come.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

A support scheme is to be set up amid fears that the price rises will lead to an increase of people living in fuel poverty. The rise will take effect from December ,  and affects firmus customers in Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Craigavon , Limavady, Derry Londonderry, Newry and more than  other towns and villages in the surrounding areas. firmus say wholesale global gas prices have increased by % from a year ago and by % since the previous tarf review that came into effect on the st October. The change in tarf means an extra pound. per week on to the average household bill. Dr David Dobbin, Chairman of firmus energy, said: We very much regret having to increase our tarf however steep increases in global wholesale gas prices have forced our hand. This is a not a firmus issue, but a challenge faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity all of whom, sooner or later, will have to further increase their prices to meet the huge upsurges which have taken place in wholesale energy costs. We know this is an unwelcome increase which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable. We have been consulting with key stakeholders and will be introducing a support scheme to be delivered through a local charity which will offer targeted help to those most in need, especially over the winter period. The scheme will be launched in the coming weeks and will go live around the same time as the increase we announced today takes effect.

Credit: PANovember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAustin Currie was a good friend of mine since we were honours history students together at Queen’s University in the early Sixties.Austin, like me, came from a working background, and the opportunity to earn a degree opened a door to careers which were not possible to previous generations from the rural outposts like Tyrone and south Armagh.Austin from the very start had great personal charm and a warm friendliness. We came from nationalist and unionist communities, but these dferences did not matter in those innocent days when it seemed that the violence which had plagued the province in the s would never . How wrong we were.In our small history tutorials at Queen’s, Austin was never lost for a word, but like me he could have done more homework. I recall one session on American history when the tutor asked him to speak about the economic decline of the West Indian sugar plantations.Instead, Austin launched into an eloquent dissertation about the Irish potato famine, until the tutor interrupted him and said, “You are not answering my question”, to which Austin replied: “I am answering my own question.” I thought even then that Currie had some of the right qualications to be a politician. After Queen’s we went our separate ways — he to politics, and me to journalism — but we never lost respect or regard for one another. I admired his integrity, his courage and his vision as he fought for justice.

Consequently this might potentially undermine the value of such reviews.”At the Belfast Council Committee meeting, Mal O’Hara of the Green Party made a proposal supported by Sinn Fein, Alliance, the SDLP and People Before Profit.It states the council will “withdraw our corporate support for the York Street Interchange scheme, and will only agree to corporate support for the schemethe review and any new scheme arising from it can meet our climate, air quality, place making and housing ambitions for the city.” The proposal also insists any approved scheme abides by requirements in the Belfast Council document “A Bolder Vision.”Councillor O’Hara added: “I am not persuaded in any way that additional road building is the solution to congestion.”DUP Alderman Brian Kingston said Councillor O’Hara wasn’t “particularly interested in the publishing of the report” and had an “anti-road strategy.”He added: “We do need roads that allow people to get around the city, to enable our economy to thrive, and to allow people to get to work, and to get to public and private services.“So we do need an effective system to allow trade and traffic to pass through the city, and not to increase congestion and exhaust fume emissions.” He said people were told in the review their comments would not be published and it would be a “breach of confidence” to do so.Councillor O’Hara said the “anti-road” accusation against him was a “misrepresentation.” He added: “The estimated price of York Street is £ million, and that was made a long time ago. The last environmental analysis of that was in , before this city and the assembly declared a climate emergency, and before we had the code red warning from the IPCC.“£ million as a baseline – it’s obviously going to cost a lot more than that. It could be signicant in transforming this city, and I am trying to recty this disconnect from North Belfast back to the city core, and the decimation of York Street that the previous roadbuilding scheme led to.”The committee decision will go to next month’s full council meeting for ratication.Most ReadVideo: Flaming lorry drives through ColeraineUlster Rugby take down ‘insensitive’ Armistice Day tweet after criticism from fans‘Disgusting’ Enniskillen war memorial posters condemned across political ideRegister lts lid on BBC NI stars’ lucrative external workAlex KaneOpinionThe real battle for the UUP’s survival is properly under wayTop VideosPlayVideo: Flaming lorry drives through ColerainePlayVideo: Stephen Rea goes head to head with himself as bust of Irish actor revealed at Ulster MuseumPlayVideo: Bus hijacked and set alight in apparent Northern Ireland Protocol protestLatest Northern IrelandCovid- infection levels continue to fall across UKTributes paid at funeral of a ‘true giant of civil rights’ Austin CurrieDUP’s Edwin Poots explains how masks on cows could reduce methane emissionsTwo men arrested under Terrorism Act over North Antrim UDA ‘human rights abuses’Bus-burning in Newtownards ‘carried out by UVF members’ – policeLatestShelter disappointed by lack of Premier League ‘flexibility’ over kit campaignChris and Rosie Ramsey to read CBeebies bedtime storyBusinessman jailed over flight that killed footballer Emiliano SalaKiller told: You may have thought mum was worthless but to us she was everythingRecord fuel prices continue to rise,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Stock imageAmy CochraneTwitterEmailNovember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAgriculture Minister Edwin Poots has suggested putting masks on cows as a way to reduce the animal’s greenhouse gas output.Cows and other farm animals produce about % of human-induced climate emissions.A UN report released in May earlier this year said swt action to cut methane pollution would rapidly reduce the rate of global warming, while boosting health and food production.Methane, which also comes from sources including fossil fuel extraction, is a short-lived but very potent climate pollutant that is second only to carbon dioxide in driving global warming.It is generally produced when cows belch after eating.Speaking on the BBC’s Nolan Show on Friday morning Minister Poots revealed that Belfast’s Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute is currently testing a hood which you can place over a cow’s nose to try and stop methane from being released into the atmosphere.He said: “It’s like a scrubber so when the cow emits methane then it catches the methane and then that doesn’t go into the atmosphere.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up When asked where the methane goes instead, he explained that it stays in the mask.“You would fix the hood over the cow’s nose and replace the pads inside every so often,” the Agriculture Minister explained.“We hope that this will do something to help reduce some of the methane produced by the cattle herd across Northern Ireland.”Minister Poots explained that cows have a “complex system of stomachs” and after swallowing grass, it is then regurgitated, chewed, and then distributed into the other stomachs.“It is in this regurgitation process that the cow would burp and release methane,” he said.“What people don’t know is that soil is very rich in carbon, a lot of carbon is sequestered by grass, which takes it out of the atmosphere and it puts it down into the soil, so it is natural thatcow is eating a product which is carbon rich then that is what it releases again.”Most ReadVideo: Flaming lorry drives through ColeraineUlster Rugby take down ‘insensitive’ Armistice Day tweet after criticism from fans‘Disgusting’ Enniskillen war memorial posters condemned across political ideRegister lts lid on BBC NI stars’ lucrative external workAlex KaneOpinionThe real battle for the UUP’s survival is properly under wayTop VideosPlayVideo: Flaming lorry drives through ColerainePlayVideo: Stephen Rea goes head to head with himself as bust of Irish actor revealed at Ulster MuseumPlayVideo: Bus hijacked and set alight in apparent Northern Ireland Protocol protestLatest Northern IrelandTributes paid at funeral of a ‘true giant of civil rights’ Austin CurrieTwo men arrested under Terrorism Act over North Antrim UDA ‘human rights abuses’Bus-burning in Newtownards ‘carried out by UVF members’ – policeStatistics agency update shows  more Covid- related deathsFour arrests over Newtownards bus hijacking as police confirm UVF involvementLatestAdam Driver reveals he found Comic Con scary and is ‘not anxious to go again’Man jailed for  years for murdering schoolgirl in ‘wicked act of revenge’Six of the best – Gareth Bale’s stunning Wales strikesEddie Jones: England on Covid rollercoaster as Ellis Genge misses Australia gameSalisbury train services to fully resume  days after crash,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

About , customers in the area, which includes Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Coleraine, Craigavon, Londonderry and Newry, will see price hikes and it’s thought other areas may soon follow suit.Why is this happening Firmus said rising global energy costs had “forced” its hand to put prices up for the third time this year. Firmus gas prices increased by % in October and by % earlier in the year. Wholesale costs make up % of customers’ gas bills, which is why global increases have such a big effect when the companies involved say they can’t absorb the cost.How will it affect me The Consumer Council said the increase would mean the annual bill of a typical household will rise by about £ a year or £ a year for those with a prepayment meter.What has Firmus said Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Speaking to the BBC, Firmus chairman Dr David Dobbin said this is a challenge being faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity. Sooner or later, they will all have to put up their costs to meet “huge upsurges” in wholesale energy costs, he said. “We know this is an unwelcome increase, which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable.”WhatI can’t afford it It’s undoubtedly a dficult time for many consumers with several price increases coming into play this winter. Firmus said it would work with a local charity to introduce a support scheme to offer targeted help to those most in need, which would open at about the same time as the increase takes effect.High prices are likely to continue throughout the first half of next year according to the Utility Regulator — and it’s been warned the volatility could even last for between  to  months.Read MoreHot tips: Five alternative ways to heat your home as winter months close inMost ReadVideo: Flaming lorry drives through ColeraineUlster Rugby take down ‘insensitive’ Armistice Day tweet after criticism from fans‘Disgusting’ Enniskillen war memorial posters condemned across political ideRegister lts lid on BBC NI stars’ lucrative external workAlex KaneOpinionThe real battle for the UUP’s survival is properly under wayTop VideosPlayVideo: Flaming lorry drives through ColerainePlayVideo: Stephen Rea goes head to head with himself as bust of Irish actor revealed at Ulster MuseumPlayVideo: Bus hijacked and set alight in apparent Northern Ireland Protocol protestLatest Northern IrelandCovid- infection levels continue to fall across UKTributes paid at funeral of a ‘true giant of civil rights’ Austin CurrieDUP’s Edwin Poots explains how masks on cows could reduce methane emissionsTwo men arrested under Terrorism Act over North Antrim UDA ‘human rights abuses’Bus-burning in Newtownards ‘carried out by UVF members’ – policeLatestRecord fuel prices continue to riseActivists hold ‘People’s Plenary’ in Cop hall as protests expected outsideCovid- infection levels continue to fall across UKJohnson  Johnson to split into two companiesTim Southee: New Zealand not getting carried away ahead of T World Cup final,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I do have strong features, don’t I ” he said, adding: “She’s got it. I’m vry happy with how it turned out.”As a globe-trotting film star, Stephen found sitting for a sculptor more liberating than some other assignments.“I’ve sat in make-up chairs for seven hours to have vampire make-up done and werewolf stuff done,” he said. “But even that has changed now because it’s all computer generated.”The Dublin-based thespian revealed that his favourite role – which earned him an Oscar nomination in  – was in The Crying Game.“I saw it recently because they have a new print of it and I went to a screening in London withNeil Jordan and told him it was a masterpiece.“I still think it’s a wonderful story of identity how you can actually control your identity, even alter it, which is an interesting thing.”Earlier this year, Elizabeth was commissioned to sculpt a bronze bust of the late John Hume, to be installed in the gardens of the Irish Ambassador’s Residence in Washington DC. Other notable subjects include Ulster rugby legend Syd Millar.Next on her list of targets are Stephen’s fellow Irish A-listers Liam Neeson and Gabriel Byrne.Most ReadVideo: Flaming lorry drives through ColeraineUlster Rugby take down ‘insensitive’ Armistice Day tweet after criticism from fans‘Disgusting’ Enniskillen war memorial posters condemned across political ideRegister lts lid on BBC NI stars’ lucrative external workAlex KaneOpinionThe real battle for the UUP’s survival is properly under wayTop VideosPlayVideo: Flaming lorry drives through ColerainePlayVideo: Stephen Rea goes head to head with himself as bust of Irish actor revealed at Ulster MuseumPlayVideo: Bus hijacked and set alight in apparent Northern Ireland Protocol protestLatest Northern IrelandCovid- infection levels continue to fall across UKTributes paid at funeral of a ‘true giant of civil rights’ Austin CurrieDUP’s Edwin Poots explains how masks on cows could reduce methane emissionsTwo men arrested under Terrorism Act over North Antrim UDA ‘human rights abuses’Bus-burning in Newtownards ‘carried out by UVF members’ – policeLatestShelter disappointed by lack of Premier League ‘flexibility’ over kit campaignChris and Rosie Ramsey to read CBeebies bedtime storyBusinessman jailed over flight that killed footballer Emiliano SalaKiller told: You may have thought mum was worthless but to us she was everythingRecord fuel prices continue to rise,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Whoever thought this was a good idea needs to go and have a word with themselves… and furthermore posted at .am — just shocking.”He added that the fact it was removed merits an apology from Ulster RugbyWhen contacted by the Belfast , a spokesperson for Ulster Rugby said: “We would like to decline the opportunity to comment.”TUV leader Jim Allister, said: “It is important that sensitivity is shown towards Remembrance Day. It is at best off-colour to post an image like this on Remembrance Day.“It is a time for reflection on the sacrice paid for the freedoms we all enjoy, not sponsorship deals. Using a war memorial as a backdrop was also unwise.”The North Antrim MLA added: “Having said all that, the fact that the tweet was pulled suggests that the error was recognised and hopefully lessons have been learned.”In , Ulster Rugby faced a similar backlash amid allegations of a calculated insult to the war dead.Some fans and politicians were angry poppies were not worn by players during a match in Wales on Remembrance Sunday. A veterans’ charity accused Ulster Rugby of disgracing itself.At the time Ulster Rugby defended the absence of a poppy on its shirt saying that several other clubs had not worn them that weekend and pointed to its war memorial and wreath-laying service it holds each year.East Belfast DUP MLA Joanne Bunting said: “At am people were pausing to reflect on the sacrice of so many for our freedom.“The war memorial at Ravenhill reflects the fact that no community was untouched.“What happened was insensitive and ill-considered.

increase in their hourly wages and to get Covid payments.The three-day protest is expected to last until Friday, or “until we get what we want”, said Unite representative Luisa Monteiro,In a statement to the Belfast , Glen Dimplex said they are “fully committed to providing a fair rate of pay which is sustainable in a highly competitive sector”.Union reps said it is more than seven months since

manufacturing sites in the local area.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email

minimum wage.“The workforce pay claim is for a £ an hour increase with the aim of catching-up the living wage, never mind what is earned by workers at other local manufacturing sites competing for the similar skilled workers amidst a labour shortage,” she continued.Mr Moore added that the Glen Dimplex bosses “need to recognise thatthis strike proceeds all production at this site will shutdown”.Workers estimate the output on one of four heater production lines in the factory alone is worth £k a day,” he said.Management need to see that the impact on the company’s bottom-line of a prolonged strike will dwarf the costs of paying its workforce fairly,” he said.The company has moved in the past couple of days towards where we want to see in terms of a wage, but this is also about respect.The company is still failing our members in terms of back pay… in terms of their ask for a recognition payment for having to work throughout the pandemic. Our members are requesting that the company... in order to get us to a living wage, to show the workers the respect that they deserve, and pay them a decent amount of back pay and the Covid payments that they deserve, for working throughout the pandemic, keeping this factory profitable and keeping production up throughout the past couple of years.”The company has been approached for comment.A spokesperson for Glen Dimplex added the company “is grateful to the majority of its staff in Portadown for continuing to work as normal towards a consensual and sustainable outcome and appeals to Unite to re-engage in a meaningful manner with the Labour Relations Agency process that commenced earlier this week.“Glen Dimplex current base pay rates already exceed the National Living Wage and as part of the current discussions Glen Dimplex has already offered an increase that would exceed what is known as the real living wage and has addressed both requests for backpay and one-off payments.“In addition to this higher base pay, workers also benefit from an hourly bonus payment further increasing pay levels above the real living wage“Unite members who voted in favour of industrial action account for a minority of the Portadown site workforce.”Most ReadVideo: Flaming lorry drives through ColeraineUlster Rugby take down ‘insensitive’ Armistice Day tweet after criticism from fans‘Disgusting’

Marie lost her mum to the horrible disease and planned to walk  walks to raise funds to support families and those with the condition locally. googletag.cmd.push Marie is about to embark on walk number  as she gets closer to her goal. Maries fundraiserhas already raised nearly pound for Alzheimers Society. Marie said: “For any of you that know me, you will be aware that I lost my lovely wee mammy in February . “Her name was Elizabeth Diamond, known as Bertha to her friends and family. My mum had Alzheimer’s disease. She was so loving and caring to everyone, decent, kind and loved a bit of craic. She lived independently with my dad in her bungalow. “However, over a number of years, this horrible disease took everything away from the person I loved. I have to admit I used to think that Alzheimer’s was memory loss and how wrong I was. “In the early stages, mum would forget dates and words and recall short-term events. She would repeat her stories quite a lot. Then it progressed to dficulty in piecing together what she wanted to say or to follow others in conversation, she lost the ability to cook and needed more and more care. “She could remember events from a long time ago when she was younger. We then experienced mood swings, sometimes irritation over the slightest things and sometimes withdrawn. In the end times, she couldn’t remember eating, food was hot and then cold or unfamiliar to her, she would have dficulty swallowing and worst of all repeating pleas for help. “My dad passed away in May  and sometimes she remembered he was gone and other times not. It was just awful but I am grateful that she knew me till the end. “I really wanted to do something positive for those suffering from this condition and for their families. So, I am doing  walks for Dementia. Why   Because that was the age my mum was when she died so one walk for each year of her le. “Mum didn’t walk herself but she lived in both the Cityside and Waterside of Derry. I’m going to walk the two bridges-Craigavon and Foyle- because it captures the city, it’s a nice walk of seven miles with lovely scenery. “I’m no athlete and whilst this would be easy for others it’s a challenge for me.  walks at seven miles per walk is  miles. However, I also want  partners to walk with me. “They can do the walk for someone they love that is or has suffered from dementia, they can do it for charity or just to support me. I’m not tied to it being the bridges, I’m also open to doing a walk that means something to my partner on the day.” For every walk, Marie will donate pound which gives a starting total of pound for the charity. “As I said, I’m definitely not an athlete but I want to do two-three walks a week. This will take me at least six months and I started at the beginning of June. “I’m conscious of some holiday time and hopefully not butany injury means I need to cut back a bit my goal is to have it all completed before my mum’s second anniversary, in February .” If you want to join Marie on her walk, either inidually, as a group or as a relay team, contact Maire via the fundraiser Facebook page:https:www.facebook WalksForDementia  To donate, go to:https:www.justgiving fundraising -walks-for-dementiaADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Bernie Friars, Tina McElhinney, Grainne McLaughlin, Lesley Ann Curry and Joyce Logan Wilson, all familiar faces who have worked at the former EUROSPAR and served the local community for decades, were given the honour of cutting the ribbon on the newly built Waterside store. googletag.cmd.push EUROSPAR Rossdowney champions a number of local suppliers in the North West area, from in-store florist Wild Berry Boutique to Higgins  Sons Family Butchers and McDaid’s Bakery with their famous burnt buns. The supermarket has also been developed with the local shoppers’ specic missions in mind – to pick up fresh, local food-to-go for now, and groceries for later. EUROSPAR Rossdowney is also the first home of the new Nourish deli, offering a nutritious selection of bowls, wraps and smoothies throughout the day. The concept has been created by Henderson Retail to offer shoppers even more choice from their popular food-to-go counters. Mark McCammond, retail director at Henderson Group, said the store represented all that was great and good about the local area. He added: “The people of the Waterside area are what makes it, and the local links for the new EUROSPAR Rossdowney store are second to none. “Not only do we have a team that has served the local community for decades, but we also have extensive ranges of products sourced from local suppliers which keep our food miles down. “We have researched the local shopper demographic extensively, so this store has been built with what they’re looking for directly in mind – fresh, locally produced ingredients for tonight’s tea, and on-site options, made fresh in-store for now.” Store manager, Keith Wilson, has been in charge throughout the build, and said the addition of  parking spaces, a two-pump MAXOL forecourt featuring regular grades and new % carbon offset Premium fuel grades, and a host of additional services on site made it the most convenient site in town. He added: “Shoppers can expect a wide range of services in-store including the Post Office and the extended range of products available from the butchery counter, alongside the first ever Nourish deli counter and all-new Barista Bar coffee, now serving flat whites and luxury hot chocolate and all the Barista coffee favourites. “Local is at the heart of everything we do, from our North West supplier roster which features Limavady’s Milgro and Broighter Gold, Derry’s Doherty Meats, Bonds Potatoes and McDaid’s Bakery alongside Coleraine’s Scott’s Crispy Onions and our top-class butchery serve over from Higgins Family Butchers in Castlerock. “We also have The CHEF range of home-cooked, pre-prepared meals which have recently been awarded Great Taste Awards. Our staff are all friendly faces, well-known and trusted in the area and our shoppers know they will be getting the best range, choice and value in-store.”  Bernie Friars, Lesley Ann Curry, Joyce Logan-Wilson, Grainne McLaughlin, Tina McElhinney, who have over  years of EUROSPAR experience between them, declare the all-new EUROSPAR Rossdowney officially open.  Over , big brand products have been price matched to Tesco, bringing even more value at a local level. Keith continued “We were delighted to have Foyle Search and Rescue on site for our opening day where we held bucket collections for the vital work they do locally. Throughout the year, we will raise money for the NI Children’s Hospice, EUROSPAR’s charity partner Cancer Fund for Children, and the Jack  Jill Foundation. Our community outreach work is extremely important we have donated sanitising stations to the local Dale View Nursing Home, and we’ll continue to support the team at Arc Fitness who do important work around mental wellbeing and addiction. “It’s very important for us to be a hub of the local community and we look forward to supporting all these organisations and more in the future.”  Flourish with Nourish The newest food to go offering created for EUROSPAR Nourish is a range of bowls, wraps and smoothies.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Reporter: Colum Eastwood Nov   addthis, The British Government have managed over the course of the past year to do something many never thought possible – there is unity among victims and survivors and the political parties in N. Ireland and Ireland in opposition to their legacy proposals which subvert the rule of law and suppresses justice, truth and accountability.  googletag.cmd.push Current Downing Street proposals create a wholesale amnesty for those in state agencies and illegal militias responsible for the worst in the conflict. It slams shut the door to effective criminal investigations, to the already small prospect of criminal prosecutions, to inquests and to civil actions. All should stand in solidarity with victims and survivors. The scale of the amnesty is immense. A recent report said it was the worst proposed anywhere in the world, worse than the + models over recent decades in places emerging from conflict, worse than that introduced by the Pinochet military dictatorship in Chile. STAKE KNIFE IS FRONT and CENTRE Why  What is to fear  The proposals would mean that the current Jon Boucher Kenova investigation into the activities of the British agent known as Stake Kne would be closed. There are people – members or previously members of state agencies and militias - who will not want Kenova to see the light of day, want to see its work and its outcomes suppressed. Stake-kne is front and centre in the thinking behind the London approach.  The justied rage against all of this is rightly directed against London. But suppression of justice and truth is the agenda of state agencies and the illegal militias. Those in command and control of both have a common interest that less not more is known, that the spotlight fades from the brutality of what was visited on the people of Derry and the people of Ireland. UNANIMITY The opposition travel far beyond victims and survivors and political parties. The United Nations Human Rights Council has expressed grave concern over the British Governments legacy proposals and said they foreclose the pursuit of justice and accountability for the serious human rights violations committed during the Troubles and thwart victims rights to truth and to an effective remedy for the harm suffered, placing the United Kingdom in flagrant violation of its international obligations. The Council of Europe speaks out, the Dublin Government, US political leaders… the weight and range of opposition is verging on unanimous. VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS FIRST The most critical voices are those of victims, survivors and advocates. Together they speak out against these proposals. Their voices are clear and true and dignied and powerful. The victims groups I have met with reject these proposals wholeheartedly not because they want to remain in the past but because they have been denied fundamental truths about what happened to their loved ones. For years, families and victims groups have kept up the fight for truth and justice for their loved ones in their own reserved, dignied way. Earlier this year, I called on Boris Johnson to come with me to meet the Bloody Sunday families, the family of Paul Whitters and the countless loved ones of those killed by the IRA and tell them that they are not entitled to go through the justice process like everybody . He is yet to take me up on my offer. It shows that even Boris Johnson cannot look victims and families in the eye. He cannot produce the worst model of amnesty in decades anywhere and then claim that reject it as barriers to reconciliation. I have walked the same streets with victims campaigners where the British Army and paramilitaries murdered their loved ones, I have stood with them outside  Downing Street against these flagrant attempts by the British Government to close off remaining routes to truth and justice. Victims and families deserve respect and to be consulted because the only proper way to a reconciled future is to listen, understand, and engage with those our troubled past has affected most. WE ARE SECOND CLASS The British Government proposals create separate classes of cases. People across Derry will be subject to the rule of law, to criminal investigation for wrongdoing. You and me and our families and friends. But another group of people will receive special treatment because of the unorm they wore. They will not be subject to the rule of law. We will be second class citizens. In this great city, the frontline of democratic resistance to being treated as second-class, now in  it is alive and well. In addition,murder by the British Army, a state force or paramilitary happened in Newcastle, London or any other city in Britain, these proposals wouldnt even be entertained by the British government of the day, never mind being railroaded through against the wishes of those whom it will affect. WAITING As the MP for Foyle, I have raised the cases of Paul Whitters, Julie Livingstone and Paul Quinn with Boris Johnson and have called out his government at every turn when they act in bad faith on legacy. Last November, I called for a public inquiry into the murder of solicitor Pat Finucane and challenged the s that successive British Governments have gone to in an attempt to deny justice to his family including having to pursue accountability through interminable court proceedings. And still the Finucane wait and still so many other families wait for justice, truth and accountability. FOUNDATION STONE Parties here, along with Irish and British administrations, negotiated the legacy proposals contained within the Stormont House Agreement, including establishing the Historical Investigations Unit. While the SDLP wanted legacy processes to be more rigorous with more powers to get to the truth, Stormont House was the agreement. It remains the foundation stone. Nowyou wore a maroon beret or a balaclava, the Tories an others are looking the other way on your crime for political expediency. TOGETHER We have now reached a critical juncture in how we choose to stand up for victims and their families as well as truth, justice, and accountability for all. The SDLP will never allow the British government to trample over internationally recognised agreements, and more importantly, the rights and wishes of victims and families to pursue truth and justice. Victims and their families will continue their long march against unfair legacy proposals, and we will be with them every step of the way.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity.

A quarterly report from Ulster Universitys House Price Index show property price rises in the council area of Derry City  Strabane District leaping from an average of pound, in the previous quarter to pound, – a jump of . per cent. googletag.cmd.push The hike is signicantly higher than any other council area in the North with the next highest rise being in Fermanagh  Omagh with . per cent. Ards  North Downs prices rose by . per cent with Belfast only having a small rise of . per cent. The Ulster University research, which has been produced in partnership with the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and Progressive Building Society, analyses the performance of the Northern Ireland housing market during the third quarter of  . The report is premised upon , transactions and reveals an overall average house price of pound, which represents a weighted annual level of growth of . per cent between the third quarters of  and  respectively. Where quarterly movements are concerned, the Index displays an increase of . per cent relative to the second quarter of . This growth remains driven by increases within the semi-detached and detached segments of the market over the quarter. Lead Researcher, Dr Michael McCord, Reader in Real Estate, Ulster University said: “The main findings of this survey indicate a market which continues to exhibit increased trading up activity and price acceleration as a consequence of strong levels of market demand coupled with supply inelasticity. “Entering into , the market displayed strong resilience, with consecutive-quarter price inflation evident, driven by high demand and optimism. “This buoyancy has continued within this quarter, with notable structural market dynamics and challenges starting to emerge, particularly in relation to the lack of housing supply. “This, compounded with the volatile economic setting posed by the precarious inflationary environment, poses some challenges ahead for the housing market.” Ursula McAnulty, Head of Research at the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which commissions the survey, added: “The latest figures produced by Ulster University confirm the ongoing strong demand in the residential housing market during the third quarter. “The number of transactions in the sample remained well above average, and average prices continued to rise as a result. “In what is traditionally a quieter period for the housing market, that effect may ease in the final quarter of the year, but there is still some expectation of ongoing demand and price growth. “However, as the cost of living increases, the situation for both prospective and existing borrowers may become more challenging as we look ahead into .” The figures for Derry will raise a eyebrow given the widening gap between home owners in the city and those still on waiting lists for social housing. Last month, Derry City  Strabane District Council passed SDLP councillor Lilian Seenoi-Barrs motion calling for council to write to the Joint First Ministers calling on them to publish a programme for government, which includes a housing strategy.  Cllr Lillian Seenoi-Barr of the SDLP At the time, Cllr Seenoi-Barr said: “Issues around accessing housing in Derry and Strabane stretch back decades and the whole of Northern Ireland is currently in the midst of a severe housing crisis. “People are currently struggling to access social housing, prices in the rental market are spiralling out of control and many young people are unable to save a deposit to get themselves on the housing ladder. “These problems are acutely felt in Derry and Strabane which has high numbers of people presenting as homeless, on social housing waiting lists and experiencing housing stress.

Firmus Energy have announced that a . per cent rise to the gas tarf in the Ten Towns Network that will take effect on December ,  – resulting in an extra pound. per week to household bills. googletag.cmd.push Derry is part of the Ten Towns Network that also include Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Craigavon , Limavady and Newry. Firmis have claimed the rise is due the wholesale global gas prices undergoing a massive  per cent hike last year and by  per cent since the previous tarf review that came into effect last month. Dr David Dobbin, Chairman of Firmus energy, said: “We very much regret having to increase our tarf however steep increases in global wholesale gas prices have forced our hand. “This is a not a Firmus issue, but a challenge faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity all of whom, sooner or later, will have to further increase their prices to meet the huge upsurges which have taken place in wholesale energy costs. “We know this is an unwelcome increase which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable. “We have been consulting with key stakeholders and will be introducing a support scheme to be delivered through a local charity which will offer targeted help to those most in need, especially over the winter period. “The scheme will be launched in the coming weeks and will go live around the same time as the increase we announced today takes effect. If any of our customers feel that they require further support, they should contact us directly to see how we can help.” Firmus have advised that customers seeking advice on their natural gas bills or direct debit payments should contact Customer Services on:   . Telephone lines are open  hours a day, seven days a week.

Earlier this month Mr Durkan contacted both the Department for Infrastructure and the Magee College campus of Ulster University to address the problems. The department confirmed that traffic attendants will be deployed to the area and work is ongoing to extend parkin at the former Foyle College pitch area. googletag.cmd.push Mr Durkan said: “The saga of inconsiderate often dangerous parking along the Duncreggan Road has been a bugbear for many over the years and is an issue which I’ve pushed to resolve. “The area in the vicinity of Magee University is a direct route into the city centre and is extremely busy throughout the week. “Both university staff and students regularly use the Duncreggan Road for parking. However, it is clear that parking is causing a great deal of disruption for residents, motorists and pedestrians alike. “Residents have complained that some iniduals parking in the area often block the entrance to their driveways, preventing them from leaving their homes. “In addition, this is a long established residential area with a majority of elderly residents health and safety concerns have been raised that the area is completely inaccessible for emergency services during the day. “I’m pleased that steps are now being taken by the department to employ more traffic wardens to the area and that Magee are working to extend parking provision in the area. I have also asked Roads Service to consider implementing additional measures, including double yellow lines.” A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: “Occupancy figures for theCampus car park show that there has only been one day since term began that the University’s car park has been over subscribed. We are aware that some iniduals choose to park irresponsibly in the area, and we have recently advised all staff and students to park legally and considerately and reiterated that parking permits are available to provide them with an affordable means to park conveniently and safely on campus. We have recently increased car parking capacity and we also continue to work closely with the Council, PSNI and local Residents Association and we understand that they are communicating considerate parking messages to the general public who may also park in the area to travel to work.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

More than  universities in the UK were balloted by the University  College Union  with . per cent of Ulster Universitys UCU members voting for strike action. In a separate ballot askingmembers would be in favour of industrial action other than walking out on strike, . per cent of Ulster Universitys union members voted a resounding yes. googletag.cmd.push Queens University in Belfast saw resounding majorities for both ballots as well with the national UK average for all UCU members being . per cent in favour of strike action with . per cent in favour of action other than a walkout. The dispute is over pay and working conditions. The UCU have demanded a national yearly pay rise of pound for all staff as well as an end to race, gender and disability pay injustice a framework to eliminate zero-hours and other casualised contracts and meaningful action to tackle unmanageable workloads. A date for strike action for the Ulster University campuses at Magee College, Coleraine and Jordanstown has yet to be set as negotiations that may prevent a walkout are expected to take place. Cllr Shaun Harkin said: “University bosses need to take stock of the resounding vote by lecturers and staff for strike action over pay, conditions and pensions. “People Before Profit send our solidarity to lecturers and staff at  universities, including Ulster University and Queens, following their overwhelming declaration for strike action over pay, working conditions and pensions. People Before Profit fully back the UCUs demands. Wages of university staff has fallen  per cent in real terms since . “A recently published report documented a widespread workload and mental health crisis in universities. Nearly a third of staff say they feel emotionally drained from work pressure. “University bosses are acting no dferently from private sector bosses. This is about turning universities and education into factories for profit. A university shouldnt be run like a corporation focused primarily on churning out profit. “Cancellation of classes will be entirely down to the belligerence and arrogance of university bosses and their disregard for workers and students. “Cynical university bosses will look for any opportunity to ide and conquer by pitting students against staff. “It needs to be remembered that university bosses didnt lt a finger to help students or staff during the pandemic. This is why solidarity between lecturers, staff and students is key. “We encourage all students to join and support the newly formed Students Supporting Industrial Action network. Well do everything we can to back the demands of lecturers and staff. “Across every sector of society employers and government are attempting to put the burden of the pandemic onto the shoulders of workers and the least well-off. The most effective way to respond is with people power resistance and solidarity.” UCU general secretary Jo Grady added: “This result is a clear vote of no confidence in the so-called leaders of our universities, with staff telling them in no uncertain terms that they have had enough of pay and working conditions being run into the ground. “UCU members have yet again beaten the Tory anti-union laws. Alongside our pension ballot result, this means we have a big mandate to take strike action, at a time of our choosing. “It is scandalous that university vice-chancellors on overinflated salaries seem to think doing nothing on pay, casualisation and inequality is acceptable in a sector awash with money. “We truly hope that disruption can be avoided, that is what staff and students alike all want. But this is entirely in the gt of employers who simply need to end their attacks on pensions, pay and working conditions and finally demonstrate they value their staff.” Ulster University has been approached for comment.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The charity’s stores in in the city will be delighted to receive any good quality toys, in full working order and complete, as well as good quality winter jumpers, coats and other warm clothes and footwear for children, menswear and ladieswear. googletag.cmd.push In addition to pre-loved quality toys, the charity is also keen to receive donations of unused toys and games, which often prove popular in the run up to Christmas when customers are looking for presents at reasonable prices. Unused toiletries that can be used as gts for teenagers are also popular in Barnardo’s shops, as well as the usual clothing and accessory donations that the charity welcomes all year round. Paula Flood, Area Business Manager for Barnardo’s Retail in Northern Ireland said: “With preparations for Christmas getting underway, this is the time of year many people need to make space for new toys and gts, so we are asking them to keep Barnardo’s in mind and donate any of their good quality pre-loved toys, or clothes, to our charity’s shops. “It’s amazing what people unearth when they start looking in the back of cupboards and at the bottom of the toybox. “It’s a great way to clear out any toys or clothes your children and grandchildren no longer play with or wear, as well as any pre-loved clothes you are not wearing. We’re particularly keen to receive any ‘winter woolly’ type items that we can sell over the coming months. “The donated items will help to raise funds for work carried out to support local children and families who need a little bit of extra help. “We’d like to thank all of our customers and donors for their continued support, which really does make a dference to so many local children’s lives.” Any donations will be received at your local Barnardo’s store at their branches in Shipquay Street and Bishops Street, Derry.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.     Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

There can be few arguments that Glen’s maestro is the best footballer in Derry at the present time. googletag.cmd.push His growth into a leader for both club and county, and a player feared and respected in equal measure, has been remarkable. In the final two years ago, McFaul had the ball in his hands as John Joe Cleary blew the final whistle and Magherafelt celebrated beating the Watty’s by the finest of margins. On Sunday evening, McFaul stood on the Celtic Park turf with a very dferent emotion. The demons had been put to bed. A first championship was here. A dream realised. “It’s unbelievable. I remember speaking to you when we beat Slaughtneil in Owenbeg two years ago. I believed we were going to win it that year and we didn’t, we slipped up,” he said. “From that day I had nightmares. It lived with me until we heard that final whistle there and all I can say is what a feeling this is.” Malachy O’Rourke’s men were relentless and ruthless on their way to this year’s showpiece but coming up against neighbours and reigning champions Slaughtneil was always going to be the toughest challenge. “We knew it was going to be a serious battle. You’ve got Paudie Tad, Shane McGuigan, the two McKaigues, Rogers, Patsy – all them boys,” he said. “They have come down the road. We hadn’t been down that road, we hadn’t gotten over the line in a final, and we knew it was going to be a   game, but our talent shone through.  “There’s serious drive in that team. We knew we had done the work with Malachy. Other years we probably peaked too early in the league. “Malachy and Ryancame in and told us we were going to peak in October November and we did just that. We showed our class today. “We deserve it. From we were under ’s, the likes of Enda and Rooster and all them boys believed in us. We knew we had the talent, and we knew it was about sticking together. “I know a boy from Tyrone that said ‘where has this Glen minor team gone ’ but we showed today that we haven’t gone away.” St Eunan’s of Donegal will await in the preliminary round of the Ulster senior club championship. That game won’t be quite on the mind yet as the celebrations continue, but for McFaul the challenge is a welcome one. “We have nothing to lose with Ulster. Some people might say we’re favourites, but we have no right to be favourites,” he said. “On our performance today I think we probably need a wee bit more to get over the line in Ulster, but we’ll worry about that when it comes.”  WATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final  St Mary’s PS Glenview has a number of past pupils involved in Slaughtneil v Glen.

Speaking after Sunday’s decider in Celtic Park, midfielder Emmett Bradley also stressed there their focus lay. Their motivation came from within. It was always about the next game, and striving for a better performance. googletag.cmd.push Since coming on the senior club scene ’ or ’ years ago, Bradley remembers the narrative. Could they translate their underage promise into the biggest prize of all  Sunday was their answer. A big fat yes. “We had to work incredibly hard,” said Bradley of their journey. “We knew were up against it and especially today, with Slaughtneil being the dominant force in years. “AsCarville said in the speech, we were just trying to replicate them. They drove us on to keep working and keep chipping away.” The John McLaughlin and Seamus McFerran Cups passed through Maghera on those autumn Sunday nights, on their way to Slaughtneil. Now it’s Glen’s turn.  Hours after speaking to the County Derry Post, Bradley was one of entire senior and reserve squad that was paraded through Maghera main street in the back of goalkeeping coach Pearse McCallan’s lorry. Memories that will last a letime. Bradley hails the squad and how they shirked off any doubt their moment in the limelight would appear. Malachy O’Rourke and Ryan Porters get a generous namecheck for adding ‘a lot’ to Glen’s snowballing juggernaut. The players accepted any challenge put at their feet. Training was hard, yet smart. Every game was taken on its merits and as momentum spiralled to the steps of Celtic Park’s Tommy Mellon stand, Glen shot their way towards a . point average winning game across seven games. “Theboys worked really hard in terms of keeping themselves right. There were very few injuries throughout the year and that meant an awful lot.” “One thing I noticed this year was that the entire team bought in. “Whatever the team needed, anybody was willing to do whatever that was needed to get over the line. “It was fitting that it was Slaughtneil that we beat. As I said, they have been the benchmark. It is who we wanted and it was who we needed. “You started to think that yourself that you have not being tested. “There was such a focus on ourselves and how could we perform and who we could improve.

For Malachy O’Rourke, the feeling of winning silverware isn’t quite as foreign. When he took the Glen managerial post, there was only one target in his mind – to repeat the feat he managed  years previous with The Loup. googletag.cmd.push He inherited a side that knew they were close but were reeling from a  final defeat against Magherafelt and then a quarter-final exit last year at the hands of the eventual champions, Slaughtneil. The only word for their campaign leading to Sunday was dominance. But this one was the acid test. Were they now ready to make that last step  “The boys put in serious hard work from the start of the year, and I suppose we all dreamt of a day like this that we could get over the line,” said the former Monaghan manager. “When you see how much it means to so many people, it’s a great feeling. We worked hard all year and the boys really put their shoulder to the wheel. “They were determined thatthey got the chance again that they were going to grab it, and I suppose that’s what they did.” As the championship ticked on, O’Rourke’s men only became more scintillating, free-flowing and relentless. A - to - semi-final victory over The Loup sent the loudest of warning signs. They were gearing up for a battle. “We felt that the boys were going well. They were training hard and they were really focused,” he explained.  “We had a good win in the semi-final but we always felt that there was more and we knew we would have to have more because of the tremendous experience that Slaughtneil have and their ability to win games. We knew we had to put in a big performance. “We started the game very well and I suppose we never let go of that stranglehold we got at the start. It was a great performance and I’m delighted to get through it.” The men in green and gold looked sharp from the get go, holding Slaughtneil to just one point in the opening half. Leading - to - ticking into the final seconds before the break, a lovely move involving Tiarnan Flanagan and Conor Glass was finished off by Danny Tallon to the net. It was the ultimate sucker punch. “Our display in the first half maybe merited being another couple of points in front, but we kicked a couple of wides so that goal gave us that buffer that was crucial at half-time. “I suppose it meant thatwe just kept our heads in the second half and played controlled football then it was always going to be hard for them to get back into it, and that’s how it turned out.” For Glen it may turn out that county championships are like buses – you wait so long for one then suddenly many come along. The age profile of this team and the frightening levels of talent would certainly indicate it. But for their manager, there’s no complacency, be it the upcoming Ulster campaign or the years to come. “Derry football is very strong and you can never look too far ahead.

For Malachy O’Rourke, the feeling of winning silverware isn’t quite as foreign. When he took the Glen managerial post, there was only one target in his mind – to repeat the feat he managed  years previous with The Loup. googletag.cmd.push He inherited a side that knew they were close but were reeling from a  final defeat against Magherafelt and then a quarter-final exit last year at the hands of the eventual champions, Slaughtneil. The only word for their campaign leading to Sunday was dominance. But this one was the acid test. Were they now ready to make that last step  “The boys put in serious hard work from the start of the year, and I suppose we all dreamt of a day like this that we could get over the line,” said the former Monaghan manager. “When you see how much it means to so many people, it’s a great feeling. We worked hard all year and the boys really put their shoulder to the wheel. “They were determined thatthey got the chance again that they were going to grab it, and I suppose that’s what they did.” As the championship ticked on, O’Rourke’s men only became more scintillating, free-flowing and relentless. A - to - semi-final victory over The Loup sent the loudest of warning signs. They were gearing up for a battle. “We felt that the boys were going well. They were training hard and they were really focused,” he explained.  “We had a good win in the semi-final but we always felt that there was more and we knew we would have to have more because of the tremendous experience that Slaughtneil have and their ability to win games. We knew we had to put in a big performance. “We started the game very well and I suppose we never let go of that stranglehold we got at the start. It was a great performance and I’m delighted to get through it.” The men in green and gold looked sharp from the get go, holding Slaughtneil to just one point in the opening half. Leading - to - ticking into the final seconds before the break, a lovely move involving Tiarnan Flanagan and Conor Glass was finished off by Danny Tallon to the net. It was the ultimate sucker punch. “Our display in the first half maybe merited being another couple of points in front, but we kicked a couple of wides so that goal gave us that buffer that was crucial at half-time. “I suppose it meant thatwe just kept our heads in the second half and played controlled football then it was always going to be hard for them to get back into it, and that’s how it turned out.” For Glen it may turn out that county championships are like buses – you wait so long for one then suddenly many come along. The age profile of this team and the frightening levels of talent would certainly indicate it. But for their manager, there’s no complacency, be it the upcoming Ulster campaign or the years to come. “Derry football is very strong and you can never look too far ahead. I’m just delighted to get through today and delighted to get the first championship for the club. “A lot will depend on the next couple of weeks and how the boys get on. We’ll not be putting any handbrake on them for the immediate future – we’ll let them enjoy it because that’s a big part of football as well. “We’ll assess things at the end of the week and see how we’re going, but we’ll enjoy this one.”  WATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final  St Mary’s PS Glenview has a number of past pupils involved in Slaughtneil v Glen.

There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here. What next, I hear you ask, well there is a group that meets around a table and weighs up the options for the best albums, I’d like to think they do this in a fair manner and once they reach a consensus then the world, who will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath, will get their answer The same is not true for the single, that is voted for by the public, you, and that’s why those bands were urging you to vote recently. The public vote is now closed so I suppose they know who’s won it by now but they’re not letting on. Rascals.

Here are  to choose from....enjoy! Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. googletag.cmd.push Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him. We get immense performances from both. The subject matter might be hard to take but its compelling and gripping stuff that will stay in your head for days after. Dog Soldiers: Monday, Film @ . A group of soldiers on routine training in the Scottish highlands find themselves under siege from a pack of beasts that should not exist. Neil Marshalls debut film is awesome. Hilarious, horric, quotable, disgusting and damn scary. A rare horror comedy that gets its blend just right. All this and we get a wicked cast too with Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, Liam Cunningham and Darren Morfitt whos just deadly as Spoon. All The Kings Men: Tuesday, Great! Movies Action @ .am Wille Stark. A real salt of the earth fellow. Liked by all. Well...... Hes a politician, a self taught kind of guy. Hes a decent man, at least he was once, back when he hadnt sold his soul. A deserved Best Picture winner back in , this portrait of the rise and fall of a famous face mixes politics and noir to brilliant effect.Broderick Crawfordand Merceded McCambridge both put in first rate performances. Journeys End: Wednesday, BBC Two @ .pm France. . The trenches of Aisne. A young soldier called Raleigh once who once believed in the importance of war sits surrounded by his comrades in a filthy, rat infested trench as the German army only metres away get ready to attack their front lines. A powerful watch that shows us bullets make no distinctions when it comes to class and social status. Asa Butterfield, Paul Bettany and Sam Clafin do strong work. Nebraska: Thursday, Film @ .am A father and son called Woody and David are taking a trip from Montana to Nebraska to claim a prize. Woody is slowly losing his memory to dementia and David is dragged into the mess. Alexander Paynes comedy drama is a beautully written and crafted look at the complexities of family relationships. Plus it has a couple of wicked belly laughs hidden away. Bruce Dern, Will Forte and especially June Squibb are all on fire. Paths Of Glory: Thursday, BBC @ .pm The men of B-company refuse to make a suicidal run at a German hill during World War . Their general is embarrassed by his perceived failure and sets out to make someone pay. Stanley Kubricks masterful anti war film is an enraging watch, one that shows the toll military le can have on humanity even when the fighting is over. Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax has never been better while George Macready as General Mireau will make you despair. Sam Whiskey: Friday, TG @ .pm Her husband is dead and Laura has a problem. The gold he stole is sitting in a boat at the bottom of the Colorado river and she needs someone to find it andit to its rightful place. Unfortunately she hires the rogue Sam Whiskey for the job. A charming. amiable western is just what you need for a Friday evening and this one led by Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson is just the ticket. Youll instantly guess how its going to end but it will keep you smiling throughout. American Mary: Friday, The Horror Channel @ .pm A broke medical student discovers an unusual way to make extra money and finds herself in some very very dark places as a result. This  dark drama horror film starring Katherine Isabelle is a highly effective piece of work. Be warned though, it should probably only be watched by those with a strong constitution butyou can go with it you discover a unique little story that will open your eyes to a whole other world. The Belly Of The Whale: Friday, RTEacute One @ .pm Joe and Ronald. Two loners in a miserable, run down seaside town in Donegal. One has come home after a long time and the other is already there scratching out a miserable existence. They come together with a plan but theres someone venal in their way. A dark dark dark Irish comedy from  that went under the radar at the time but its still worth your time. Michael Smiley, Peter Coonan and Pat Shortt do nice work as three men youd cross four fields to avoid.

The area will also be power washed.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange.New safety railings are to be installed outside  Church Street, while a mural will be painted on one of the gable walls at the entrance to the car park at this part of the town.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Plans have also been outlined to provide new festive lighting on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.The draft plan confirms a proposal to appoint a quantity surveyor to oversee the substantial investment with hopes that the work can start as soon as the document secures approval from the steering group.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed the opportunity business and property owners are being given to revitalise what he described as a key part of the town.ldquoThe proposed Church Street investment is welcome news in a part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses whose links with Downpatrick stretch back over several generations, he said.ldquoThe draft plan provides a vision for the future and business owners welcome the signicant investment which will considerably help Church Street which has missed out on funding for some considerable time.Cllr Curran said the revitalisation scheme provided a firm  on which to build for the future and he hoped that business and property owners will be encouraged to spend some of their own money on their respective properties to make them even better.He is also keen to see progress on the Irish Street scheme which has not made the progress many would have hoped by this stage.Cllr Curran added: ldquoRedeveloping the former police base site and neighbouring properties will be a game-changer and act as a catalyst to secure more investment, increasing footfall which will benefit existing traders.ldquoDownpatrick is a county town and its status warrants not only a vibrant retail hub, but a place where all buildings look smart and welcoming.ldquoSignicant sums of money have been invested in other town centre streets and I am delighted that it is now Church Streetrsquos turn to benefit from some much-needed, but very welcome investment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin make history  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN were crowned junior champions for the first time in their  year history after a pulsating contest with Dundrum concluded in a three-point victory at Pairc Esler on Friday night.Despite a commendable second half surge from John Clarkersquos Dundrum men, the lsquoFin showed their experience in the competition and managed to cling on to achieve intermediate status for next yearrsquos campaign.Dundrum began on the offence straight from the start, winning the throw-in and immediately attacking the opposition.This set the tone for what would be a highly paced and energetic contest, as Aughlisnafinrsquos Oran Flanagan fouled Dundrumrsquos Michael McGrattan for a free within the opening minute.However, what should have been a straight forward conversion was missed by Cormac Venney.Breannain McComiskey immediately made Venney rue his miss, as the Aughlisnafin man kicked over the bar following good build-up play from Shea Croskery for the opening score of the final.The lsquoFin kept their foot on the pedal and won the following kick-out, with Flanagan making up for his earlier foul to convert a point from play.Referee Conor Curran was kept busy throughout the game and first brandished his yellow card just four minutes in to Aughlisnafinrsquos Noel Travers after a sloppy high tackle.Following patient build up play, Croskery added his sidersquos third point of the game, with Dundrum now desperate to get on the board.It was clear nerves were playing a part in the early stages, as Venney failed to convert another free wide, this time dragging his shot right of the posts.With Aughlisnafin piling the pressure on the Dundrum defence the ball was worked back to lsquokeeper Walsh who played a fist pass out to team-mate Thomas McShane  metres from goal.However, disaster struck as the Dundrum man fumbled the ball in the danger area, allowing Flanagan to pick up the scraps and bury the ball into the back of the net to give The lsquoFin a six point lead less than ten minutes in.Michael McGrattan tried to answer for Dundrum but saw his effort drt wide before custodian Walsh finally got his side off the mark with a converted free.McComiskey replied sharply, notching his second point by kicking over the black spot from open play, although Venney did answer this with a point of his own that he desperately needed just before the water-break.At the conclusion of the opening quarter, Aughlisnafin were by far the dominant side and led - to -.On the restart Dundrum managed to find their groove and make up for earlier mistakes courtesy of successive points from Venney and McGrattan.However, Aughlisnafin would soon hit their opponents with a damaging blow as Tiernan Noadersquos high ball over the top found lsquoFin forward Adam Garland, who converted his sweetly struck shot into the top left corner for the second goal of the game after  minutes.Noade won a turnover from the resultant kick-out, but saw his effort sail wide before McGrattan replied with a point for Dundrum after winning an inidual battle with Aughlisnafin defender Sean Fitzsimmons.The contest was beginning to ebb and flow with both sets of supporters making their voices heard, as Garland dummied his man, but missed the target.Despite Noade pulling his shot wide a minute later, Aughlisnafinrsquos high balls over the top were clearly causing Dundrum all sorts of bother as their defence struggled to maintain the pressing forward line.Garland kicked over a free to give his side a - score line as Dundrum prepared to introduce substitute Odhran McKibbin to the pitch.Perhaps overeager to impress, McKibbin received a yellow card immediately following a late tackle, as referee Curran continued to show efficient officiating beyond his years.Soon after, McComiskey registered his third point of the match, but once again, Dundrum showed why they made it to the final.After overturning the ball in midfield, the ball worked its way to Dundrum captain Aidan Fegan, who played a lovely pass over the top to McGrattan.The forward found himself in acres of space and struck the ball with conviction past lsquoFin lsquokeeper Morgan Croskery and into the net.Garland replied with a free just before half time as the score read Aughlisnafin - Dundrum -.The lsquoFin began the quicker following the restart after a McComiskey lsquorsquo floated into Garland, who pointed over for the first score of the half.A series of wides took up the next five minutes of the game before McComiskey became the latest player to enter Conor Curranrsquos book, receiving a yellow for a high tackle.Travers then pulled his effort wide before his side won the resultant kick-out and forced a fantastic save from Dundrumrsquos Walsh, who stopped a certain goal.Walsh found himself at the opposite end of the pitch a minute later to kick over a fantastic free, which spurred team-mate Venney on to convert one himself in the following passage of play.This was Venneyrsquos third time raising the white flag and the last notable piece of action before the second water-break as Dundrum trailed by four.The last quarter was nothing short of dramatic, as both sets of players were clearly beginning to fatigue and yet still managed to throw everything at eachother.Dundrum really set the scene for a nail-biting last  minutes when they passed the ball neatly from one end of the pitch to the other before skipper Fegan found David McComiskey with only lsquokeeper Croskery to beat.Dundrumrsquos McComiskey duly converted make it a one-point game and now the atmosphere was beginning to reach fever pitch.John Hurley saw his chance sail wide for Dundrum before Garland kicked over a free to double his sidersquos lead.McGrattan continued to battle, winning a free out of nothing, before Walsh stepped up to send the ball over the bar.Shea Croskery received a yellow card in between two wide balls from Dundrum, as they resulted to kicking from range in the final five minutes.Walsh was forced to make another eye-catching save, this time preventing substitute Ruairi Croskery from converting.Garland managed to kick over a point a minute later to add to his impressive personal tally before Flanagan saw his long range effort split the posts to give Aughlisnafin a comfortable three point margin.With just seconds on the clock, Dundrum knew it was now or never and with the last free of the night attempted a short pass to allow an opportunity for a strike on goal.However, Shea Croskery was on hand to block the shot as Curranrsquos whistle sounded for the final time to signal it would be Dolen Croskeryrsquos men who would lt the trophy.Aughlisnafin: M Croskery J Matthews, S Fitzsimmons, S Willoughby O OrsquoToole, B McComiskey , N Travers D Steele , O FlanaganS

Tyrella passed the stringent tests for the seventh successive year.Announcing the disappointing news for Newcastle, Environment Minister, Sam Foster, said the failure of the three beaches was due to sewage dischargers, which he added highlights the problems caused by the lack of investment in sewerage services.However, the Water Service yesterday stressed that it was unlikely the discovery was due to the failure of the multi-million pound sewage treatment plant which was built at the townrsquos harbour in the s.A Water Service spokesman said there has been no failure at the sewage plant since  and it is therefore questionable that it is the source of the problem.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Development Association will be unveiling its latest regeneration scheme at the end of the month.The official ceremony will be performed by former Down councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, who will be joined by a number of people from the town and representatives from the International Fund for Ireland.Work on the High Street project started in January and was completed in September and has transformed the area, with the ambitious pound, project including four ground floor shops, two first floor apartments and a cottage.The cottage has recently been sold and the four retail units are currently available for rental with Association officials confident they can secure tenants.Construction work began at the start of the year and the project team behind the scheme are confident the scheme will greatly enhance this area of Killyleagh which is close to the townrsquos historic castle.CASTLWELLAN mdash Elderly people in Castlwellan are being disturbed by children running through their gardens, according to the local SDLP branch.During a recent meeting of the Castlewellan and Kilcoo branch, the chairman, John Duggan, said he was concerned that some older residents were being bothered by a number of young people.Mr Duggan pointed out that Castlewellan was an excellent place to live but said there was an absolute need for children to pay courtesy to their elders within the neighbourhood.ldquoWhat makes a good community spirit is the ability to have respect for others within the community.

Catherine OrsquoConnor was in fineform and led the EDAC ladies in style.Her aim was top ten and she managed that with ease coming eighth in . for the three miles.

Both distances started at the Mary Peters Track and then headed off into the forest and then along the towpath.There were over  in the K and  in the K. East Down had two runners both doing the K, Sharon Madine and Rachel Madine .Despite her birthday celebrations the night before, Sharon looked fresh as she set off with the lead pack and she was more than able to stick with the pace throughout.While she didnrsquot particularly relish the hill at the start or the climb to the finish, she appreciated the scenery en route.Her efforts placed her third female at the finish and it is worth noting that her time of . was only a few seconds off second place.Rachel equally enjoyed both the route and the race and was pleased to come well up the field in nd place .For Rachel though, this was only part one of her weekend commitments.The annual event organised by Atlas Running on behalf of the Ballynahinch British Legion took place on Sunday morning with a K route along the back roads of the town.Even though she had already raced the day before, Rachel Madine felt that she couldnrsquot let this race go by without taking part as it is right on her doorstep.In fact she could be considered a regular as this is her third time enteringThe  odd runners who turned up were delighted to be greeted with pleasant, bright weather as last year they had to endure torrential rain and high winds.Despite the hilly course, the race was won in a speedy . by Lawrence OrsquoHara of North Belfast.

A good weekendrsquos work for her.It was cross country all the way for the EDAC juniors last weekend but one option was closer to home in Ballyclare while the other necessitated a long drive to Donegal.The home birds were running in the U- race prior to the McConnell Shield cross country in the Six Mile Water Park. It may only have been a mile but it was a tough mile.Matthew Taylor actually ran more than a mile as he arrived late thinking he was in the next race on the program and performed the quickest vest change and number putting on ever seen.He just made it to the back of the pack as the whistle blew. Undeterred he dug in and made his way through the small pack and was barely in his stride when he realised that it was time to sprint for the finish line.He couldnrsquot believe his luck when he was then handed a medal for second boy. Talk about a whirlwind experience - maybe the lack of time to consider what lay ahead was a good thing.Even though he had no time to greet them at the start, he was able to congratulate the two other EDAC runners at the end.Amelia Spick was taking on her first cross country ever and seemed to enjoy the race. Her new spikes are now duly christened and hopefully she willfor another shot at this discipline.She ran an even pace as advised and finished sixth girl and ninth overall. Ky Murray was two places behind and closing in the latter stages.Her lightning sprint brought her within five seconds of Amelia and she was placed eighth girl overall.The juniors then took on the role of supporters, cheering on the adults which was much appreciated encouragement. It is this element of whole club camaraderie that makes cross country so special.Further afield then were the Robinson brothers who had travelled to Stranorlar in Donegal for the NI and Ulster XC Championships .Despite some rain early on in Ballyclare, the athletes raced in dry, almost sunny conditions and there was very little mud to slow them down, but Oliver and Alex were not so lucky.The rain the night before made the course very boggy and although the rainbows on the day suggested it might clear, this was just a tease. Even during the dry spells the biting wind made conditions tough for the runners.Alex was first up running a distance of two kilometres in the U- race. He started safely and quickly became part of the leading pack on the course two loops around two fields.On the second lap he led the breakaway pack and looked comfortable as they disappeared into the second field.When he emerged he had ped to fth and was running with just one shoe having lost the other in the deep mud. The last m metres were heroic as he battled to hold his place only being overtaken in the last m.He was so disappointed with the outcome and on reflection said he should have ditched his shoe sooner instead of losing speed trying to keep it on.A hard lesson to learn but Alex showed his grit and has been rewarded with selection as an inidual into the U- Ulster and NI team for the All-Irelands in Gowran, Kilkenny at the start of December.He was placed sixth out of  runners in a time of ., only  seconds behind the winner.

Enough is enough, it is time to see these projects delivered to improve the lives of local workers and families.With the approach of winter and worsening road conditions due to weather and darker evenings, Cllr Mason said visibility will become poorer.ldquoWe need to see urgent action from the Minister to address the concerns of the local community to ensure our roads are safe and up to satisfactory standard before winter hits, she contended.ldquoWinter gritting is a huge cause for concern for many in our local rural communities and the Minister needs to deliver a more effective solution to winter gritting on our rural roads with priority for those in more isolated areas who fear another winter stuck in their homes, the councillor continued.ldquoMany farmers who rely on milk collection lorries arriving daily and accessing feed supplies for their animals, need the certainty that their services and routine will not be disrupted. Those who work as frontline staff such as the emergency services and domiciliary care workers must have a safe passage to and from peoplersquos homes, while childcare services and rural schools must be able to operate smoothly.ldquoWe cannot allow ordinary people to suffer and a management plan must be implemented to ensure gritting is carried out throughout the winter period, she added, confirming that she has written to Mrs Mallon to raise her concerns.A DfI spokesman said Mrs Mallon ldquocompletely rejects these unfounded assertions and will continue to work equitably across all council areas, including South Down, to improve the condition of the road network.ldquoThe Minister is fully aware of the condition of roads in South Down and will continue to work for all communities to deliver the infrastructure they need, he said.ldquoThe fact that the Minister has increased the funding for the rural roads fund by % and allocated poundm mdash a % increase on last yearrsquos budget mdash specically for rural roads across the North, including South Down, is a clear demonstration of this commitment to rural communities. This funding is not impacted by current legal challenges.The spokesman explained that as a result of challenges to awarding resurfacing contracts earlier this year, ious schemes which the Department had intended to progress during the current financial year have been delayed in four council areas, including Newry Mourne and Down.But he confirmed the Department is taking forward a new procurement strategy and hopes to be in position to go to tender shortly and to have new term contracts in place next January to continue resurfacing programmes in these areas, including in South Down.ldquoSignicant programmes of work have been delivered across all areas in  , in particular on rural roads and while capacity to reallocate resurfacing budgets across areas is limited, every effort is being made to maximise spend across all areas, said the spokesman.ldquoIn relation to the Ballynahinch bypass, Minister Mallon provided an opening allocation of pound.m for land costs and scheme development in -. The next steps are procurement and progression to construction.ldquoProgression to construction will, however, depend on budget allocations made to the Department in future years. Subject to funding being made available, it is estimated that it would take around  months to the start of construction from any decision to move to procurement, and a further  months to construct the scheme.The spokesman explained that as part of planning for the winter gritting programme, the Department ensures that adequate staff are available, all winter service equipment is in satisfactory working order and that there are adequate supplies of salt.He added: ldquoWhile the Department generally salts the main through routes which carry more than , vehicles per day, in exceptional circumstances, roads with dficult topography carrying between , and , vehicles daily will also be salted.ldquoGrit piles are also available for use by the public on a self-help basis on selected routes not included on the salting schedule and arrangements are in place to enlist the help of private contractors and local farmers to assist in efforts to clear blocked roads in rural areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_smell.jpg","title":"Multi agency  response call on foul smell  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has called for a multi-agency response to two issues of concern in the Dundrum area.Northern Ireland Water, the Department for Infrastructure and Rivers Agency have been asked to address recent damage caused by flood water at the Moneycarragh River, with the utility company and Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos environmental health department asked to investigate the cause of foul smelling liquid seeping from land close to Dam Lane in the village.The appeal for the ious agencies to work together on both issues has been made by Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis.In relation to the Moneycarragh River, the councillor has called for the waterway to be ldquoed to its natural state, with the appeal coming after recent flooding which led to a burst pipe resulting in a number of consumers in the area left without supply.In June, Cllr Lewis raised concerns of local farmers with NI Water after a concrete floor was installed on the floor of the river, directly under Bennettrsquos bridge which runs over it.ldquoThe work prevented water from pooling, which subsequently forced floodwater to erode stone walls and the river bank which exposed a water supply the pipe which was damaged by rocks and it burst, he added.Cllr Lewis claimed rising floodwater has also undermined the integrity of the bridge and widened the river banks which exposed the water supply pipe.ldquoPreviously, farmers were able to drive machinery down the natural land slope to collect water from the river for animals and farm use, but this access has been altered so much that a sizeable dip has been left on the river bank.Cllr Lewis said the damage was ldquopredictable and claimed that the manipulation of the riverrsquos natural flow has, over time, distorted its integrity, warning that erosion which will eventually cause the collapse of the supporting walls at the bridge and adjoining roadway.He has asked NI Water and roads officials to urgently join forces to address the issue andthe river bed to its natural state.Turning to Dam Lane, Cllr Lewis says he hopes local afgghghuthority environmental health officials and NI Water will be able to address the issue.ldquoI recently received numerous complaints regarding a foul smelling fluid which has been seeping onto the pavement at this part of the village. There are suggestions that fluid is coming from a nearby drain or sewer, he explained.Cllr Lewis said that while he is aware that there is a sewage treatment plant nearby, there are no suggestions that the spillage came from it.He added: ldquoIt is in everyonersquos interest to identy what is casing this issue and to recty it as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_kathy.jpg","title":"Newcastle woman Kathy to meet Sir David Attenborough at event  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE woman will be rubbing shoulders with Sir David Attenborough at a virtual event which will explore ways of ensuring a better future.Kathy Black is taking part in the Festival of Discovery, which begins tomorrow and ends on Saturday.Also joining her in the event, which is being run by the Eden Project, will be comedian John Bishop, best-selling author Ben Miller and BBC gardening presenter Mark Lane.Al of them will be taking part in inspiring sessions about eco-friendly initiatives taking place across the UK.Kathy, who runs Unit T in Newcastle, will be sharing the story of how she and a team of volunteers responded to their local arearsquos needs by opening a sustainable community kitchen during the pandemic.Built from re-purposed materials and located in the heart of the town, Unit T distributes home-grown produce, local goods and food near its sell-by date.As well as providing a vital and sustainable service for the community, Unit T have inspired and involved young people to live within their means and connect with each other and the natural world.The three-day Festival of Discovery is jam-packed with speakers,  and workshops.Tracey Robbins, Head of UK Delivery at Eden Project Communities, said: ldquoWersquore absolutely thrilled to be inviting Kathy to the Festival of Discovery.ldquoHere at Eden Project Communities, we know that there are thousands of amazing people doing their bit to protect the planet by joining forces with their communities and seeing the amazing things that can happen when we work together.ldquoWe canrsquot wait to hear some of their stories and hope that everyone attending will come away feeling inspired and motivated to get together to protect our planet.The Festival of Discovery will take place online.

Dual carriageways were constructed for much of the distance between the M at Lisburnand Newry.However, from the s the southern section of the intercity road has been upgraded in stages to motorway, and completed as such in .Suddenly the northern part of the road, the A, was noticeably inferior. The route around Newry was a twisting single carriageway with a high fatality rate, and the dual carriageway sections had deadly gap junctions, in which cars have to cross the central reservation amid fast oncoming traffic to make a right turn.Much of that basic dual carriageway remains in place today.The infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has approved an upgrade scheme that will replace most of the A gap junctions with flyovers. This is welcome, but it has been a tortuously slow process, with construction not even under way some  years after the southern motorway reached the border.Part of the problem is that the Irish authorities used tolls to help fund their world-class motorways, whereas populist Stormont politicians are almost always reluctant to ask the public to help pay for services.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLast week I joined my fellow Labour MP Ruth Jones, along with Vale of Glamorgan Member of the Senedd Jane Hutt and others, to speak at the s Women of Wales rally in Cardf Bay.The group continues to campaign for justice on their pensions, calling for fair and fast compensation from the UK Government, following the summer finding by the Parliamentary  Health Service Ombudsman that the Department for Work and Pensions should have given more notice of their decision to raise the womenrsquos state pension age.I met group members outside the Senedd, many of whom have faced great hardship as a result of the DWPrsquos actions, and I will continue to support them in their fight for justice.Irsquove recently heard from many constituents about sewage pollution. It is shocking that the UK is ranked th out of  European countries for coastal water quality and only % of waterways meet good ecological status.As a regular open water swimmer myself and someone who loves our beautul rivers, lakes and coastlines, Irsquom deeply alarmed at the ongoing revelations about sewage discharge and other pollution incidents.After UK Conservative MPs tried to block efforts to improve the situation via an amendment to the Environment Bill, the House of Lords emphatically voted to send back the amendment to end the routine discharge of raw sewage into rivers. Unsurprisingly the Government then voted to weaken that amendment.They are simply in the wrong place environmentally and politically ndash which is deeply concerning in the week of COP. We need bolder, more urgent actionwe are to address the climate and nature crisis.While the regulation of water and sewers is generally reserved to the UK Government, here in Wales there are powers to regulate undertakers whose areas are wholly or mainly in Wales ndash and Irsquom pleased the Welsh Government is committed to tackling pollution by using these powers.This year marks  years of Remembrance as we know it, as the Royal British Legionmarks its centenary..removeAs we approach Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday, it was an honour to plant a stake in the first Parliamentary Constituency Garden of Remembrance, to remember all those from Cardf South and Penarth who have served and paid the ultimate sacrice.It brought to mind the huge sacrices of our armed forces across the years and to this day.

The rough clftop path between bushes resembled a river after previous heavy rainfall and paddling their way along it, a deviation into fields for a quick stop for morning refreshments as overhead there were traces of blue in between the clouds.Crossing a sticky muddy ploughed field brought them to the dismantled railway line where at last the sun made an appearance and following Fort Road and crossing the busy Lavernock Road, a gate led them into Cosmeston Lakes Country Park beside the Medieval Village.A lush green meadow above the Sully Brook brought them to a stile leading into the Community Orchard, planted by volunteers in  and then through a gate into Cogan Wood, where squirrels were bounding and delicately prancing along the ground seeking food before scurrying up into the trees. Reaching Mile Road they continued towards Old Cogan Hall Farm to enter the churchyard of St Peterrsquos where lunch was taken whilst soaking up the sunshine that felt more like May than November.Refreshed they walked on through what had been the deserted medieval settlement of Old Cogan which relates to the th century when the church was built. It appears buildings were set within gardens on either side of a sunken lane and there was a village pond or a well with a mill and leat set to the south of the village..removeA narrow track brought them into woodland at the rear of Myrtle Close to hop across the Sully Brook into the lovely open green space of St Cyres Park with deep blue skies overhead. Then onto pavements taking them through Penarth town by way of Glyndwr Road, Elfed Avenue and across Redlands Road, through Mountjoy Crescent and more open parkland to the lovely upgraded Golden Gates Park and past the Grade II listed St Josephrsquos Church, which took seven years to build as work was interrupted by the Great War.By lane to reach Dingle Road and across the railway footbridge just as a train was approaching and then across the A Windsor Road into Windsor Lane, across Plassey Street to Plassey Square open space and along Harbour View Road to Queen Street.

The land was then taken by King Henry VII and leased out to local well to do families like the Herbertrsquos, Windsorrsquos and Lewis families.This area to the north of Penarth is known as The Bowery and was a poor area without access to education, doctors or a good standard of living.

The Irish making the journey by boat often arrived starving and disease riddenthe journey had taken longer than expected. Whilst to the south of Penarth, it was a dferent story as the middle and upper class residents were better dressed, had moral values and enjoyed wealth and all the other things their counterparts in the north of the town lacked. A lane between houses built into the hillside at the rear of Paget Road brought them to Steep Street for the short walk back to their start, this time with sunny views across Cardf Bay and beyond.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

A support scheme is to be set up amid fears that the price rises will lead to an increase of people living in fuel poverty. The rise will take effect from December ,  and affects firmus customers in Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Craigavon , Limavady, Derry Londonderry, Newry and more than  other towns and villages in the surrounding areas. firmus say wholesale global gas prices have increased by % from a year ago and by % since the previous tarf review that came into effect on the st October. The change in tarf means an extra pound. per week on to the average household bill. Dr David Dobbin, Chairman of firmus energy, said: We very much regret having to increase our tarf however steep increases in global wholesale gas prices have forced our hand. This is a not a firmus issue, but a challenge faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity all of whom, sooner or later, will have to further increase their prices to meet the huge upsurges which have taken place in wholesale energy costs. We know this is an unwelcome increase which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable. We have been consulting with key stakeholders and will be introducing a support scheme to be delivered through a local charity which will offer targeted help to those most in need, especially over the winter period. The scheme will be launched in the coming weeks and will go live around the same time as the increase we announced today takes effect. If any of our customers feel that they require further support, they should contact us directly to see how we can help.
