This deal today shows I was right to be concerned.\u0027Once again, there appears to be extremely little in this New Zealand trade deal to benefit British farmers. \u0027UK farm businesses face significantly higher costs of production than farmers in New Zealand, and margins are likely to tighten further in the face of rising input costs, higher energy bills and labour shortages. \u0027The Government is now asking British farmers to go toe-to-toe with some of the most export-orientated farmers in the world, without the serious, long-term and properly funded investment in UK agriculture that can enable us to do so the sort of strategic investment in farming and exports that the New Zealand government has made in recent decades.\u0027Ms Batters said there is an \u0027urgent need\u0027 for ministers to deliver a \u0027coherent approach\u0027 across all of Whitehall to boost UK farming\u0027s productivity. She said the Government\u0027s domestic policy is still \u0027woefully sparse\u0027 on how \u0027farmers will be supported to become competitive food producers at a time when food security is an increasingly important concern\u0027. Under the trade deal, New Zealand will be granted more access to the UK market for lamb exports.The deal will see all quotas on lamb lifted after 15 years, but before that there will be a quota of 35,000 tonnes for the first four years, then 50,000 additional tonnes thereafter.However, the extra quota will only be accessible once the existing quota that the country has under World Trade Organisation rules of 114,000 tonnes is filled to 90 per cent, and officials insisted that as it stands New Zealand currently only uses half of that. They also stressed there are safeguards in place to protect UK farming. "},{"url":null,"title":"Man wins giant vegetable prize GRAVE","story":"Share this article Mr Layman also passed on the skills to his son, now 43, who has won competitions with a 20kg (44lbs) beetroot and a 4kg (8lbs) parsnip. Today Tyrone is trying to inspire a new generation of vegetable growers to keep the legacy going.Speaking about entering his father into the competition after his death, Tyrone said: \u0027Dad always grew leeks.\u0027At the time of his passing we were growing some big ones together.

Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne When Jackson Lennon (20) transitioned from female to male in an all-girls Dublin Catholic secondary school, he received great support from teachers and friends. However, he also says he confronted opposition from some quarters when he asked to dress a way that was consistent with his gender identity.“The school was strict about uniforms, and everyone had to wear long skirts. They called me out of class a lot,” says Lennon.“I was very close to one of my teachers and he really fought for me. A few teachers were like that, but he was a teacher representative on the board of management. He was a lovely, lovely man and he saw that I was very unhappy, that I was struggling,” Lennon says.“Their only complaint was that I got to wear warm, fluffy socks when they had to wear tights through winter. But that became a joke. Nobody cared what I wore in the end.“My mam stood by me the whole time, taking time off work because she didn’t want me to stop going to school. She wanted me to be happy and comfortable at school. Eventually, I was allowed to wear tracksuit pants, but they looked awful with the rest of the uniform. So, my mam brought me to the shop and we got proper trousers.”Lennon says inidual teachers responded differently: some were happy to use his preferred name others were not. Some were sensitive and supportive, others came across as petty and unkind. He feels more could have been done by management, such as a training workshop on transgender students for staff.“They made out like they were protecting me, that I’d get bullied if I stuck out like a sore thumb,” he says.Lennon’s school did not respond to requests for comment.OutlierHow to respond to transgender students is an issue many Irish schools are only beginning to grapple with. Ireland is an outlier in its tendency to separate boys and girls in education. Apart from Muslim countries, Ireland has one of the highest instances of single-sex schooling in the world. This mode of organising young people proves problematic for those who don’t fall easily into one of two traditional gender categories.Change is happening, albeit unevenly. We’re more used to seeing many schoolgirls wearing trousers, a seemingly gender-neutral option. Inside school buildings, some students have the option of gender-neutral toilets and changing facilities, but not all.Contributors to a 2020 qualitative research project undertaken by University of Limerick’s school of education and Transgender Equality Network Ireland (Teni) recount instances of bullying and intimidation in single-sex toilets.Esther, the parent of a trans boy, explained how the 15-year-old was subjected to non-physical bullying because he used the male changing room. “I think they’d thrown his stuff on the floor. I was just so upset about that.” Another child reports being physically assaulted in a single-sex toilet.PE lessons can prove problematic in both mixed and single-sex schools. Research shows many transgender students reported that discrimination prevented them from participating in sports fully and safely.A further study carried out by Aoife Neary and Ruari-Santiago McBride reveals the limited pre-service and in-service training for school staff around gender ersity. Staff in the study said this left them feeling anxious and ill-prepared to support their transitioning students. A minority of students confided in a staff member only to be met with an invalidating response. One child, Shane, interviewed for the study, explained that even after his parents’ intervention, teachers continued to name him incorrectly, causing considerable distress.PanicAnother child, Esme, recounting a similar experience, reported having panic attacks which led to non-attendance, impacting on her education and development. The study includes examples of indirect bullying and transphobia among staff, in line with international findings.However, staff are also described as “helpful” and “compassionate” in the report, particularly when school leaders play a key role in educating and training the school community appropriately. Simple steps such as apologising for an error in pronoun usage make a significant difference to children’s wellbeing.Dr Malie Coyne, a clinical psychologist, says the type of school really matters.“I know of transgender children who have moved school because there was little inclusivity in their previous school,” she says.“A gendered uniform is extremely difficult for these children. Having to wear a skirt when you identify as a boy can be humiliating.Coyne says it is crucially important to the wellbeing of a young person that his or her gender identity is treated with dignity, respect and fairness.“Sometimes the biggest challenge can be for the child to accept it themselves. You put that on top of being a teenager when the brain is under construction and your hormones are flaring, and your body is changing, and you’ve got this fear of your body developing.“It’s no surprise that their mental health can be impacted, which is the reason we need to support children on their journeys of identity. They have every right to be themselves.”VoiceParents’ representatives say consultation should happen in schools so everybody has a voice. Áine Lynch of the National Parents Council Primary says: “This isn’t just about gender, it’s also about cultural inclusivity. Practical decisions must be taken to reflect differences within the school community. These consultations need to happen frequently so that nobody is left out.”John Curtis of the Joint Managerial Board, which supports most voluntary secondary schools, says uniforms rarely pose a problem in the sector.“Most of the schools we work with are single-sex. Uniforms can play an important role in providing a level playing field.“Nobody is looking over their shoulder at who has or hasn’t got the latest runners, everyone is the same. If any inidual issues arise, they are dealt with and sorted out at local level. We have excellent relationships with all parties involved.”Changing times: How some schools are adapting their policiesToilets: Newly-built schools now have the option of gender-neutral toilets. Instead of traditional boys’ and girls’ toilets with urinals or cubicles in closed-off rooms, the new design is based on private cubicles that open into a public or common washbasin area.Uniforms: More schools are moving to provide a variation in uniform policy (trousers, skirts, tracksuits, etc). Single-sex schools are increasingly offering gender-neutral options, such as trousers in all-girls’ schools.Pronouns: Schools are advised to discuss with students and their parents how they should refer to a student and day-to-day use of pronouns.Official registers: Schools may change the name and gender of students on official databases with a gender recognition certificate, while the State Examinations Commission deals with cases inidually."},{"url":null,"title":"four step covid 19 plan drafted to see ireland out of pandemic","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Prof Mary Horgan at the unveiling of a portrait of Prof Horgan, 142nd president (and first female president) of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, in Dublin on Monday. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill  The Government has discussed a four-step plan for living with Covid-19 which would see an emergency protocol established if a new variant of concern threatens public health. The Cabinet Covid-19 subcommittee met on Monday afternoon and heard an upbeat assessment from public-health officials about the current trajectory of the virus. Ministers also discussed the plan for tackling Covid-19 up until this winter and beyond.Sources said there will be four elements to the plan. The first involves an immediate phase in which a continuing focus is placed on meeting the current Covid-19 demands in terms of hospital care, vaccinations and testing and trace.The second part of the plan involves a transition phase that will see PCR testing and vaccinations scaled back to a significant degree, with the dismantling of a workforce of thousands in vaccination centres, test and trace and labs. A stock of antigen tests will likely be kept by the health service. One senior source said it is hoped that many of these staff can be reabsorbed into the health service or that some would consider new positions within the Health Service Executive. Annual vaccineThe third part of the plan will look at a longer-term way of living with Covid-19 in the years to come. This will likely see the public offered a yearly vaccine, possibly in the winter, although the National Immunisation Advisory Committee has yet to give advice to Government on a fourth dose. It is expected that advice will be received in a matter of weeks. Under the fourth part in the plan, an emergency protocol will be set up which will see a rapid increase in vaccination stocks in case of the emergence of a variant of concern. Work is advanced on a system for quickly ramping up the workforce capacity as well as lab capacity and testing and tracing should an emergency situation arise in the coming months and years. Discussions are also still ongoing on setting up a successor to the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) which has wound down. It is likely that a smaller multidisciplinary group will be set up to monitor the situation for the remainder of the year, with experts from science, medicine and behavioural economics to feature. The deputy chief medical officer Ronan Glynn updated Ministers on the current trajectory of the virus around the country. Sources said the assessment was upbeat overall. Ministers were told that the trajectory of the disease is stable and that the underlying indicators are still good while severe illness is low.There was also a conversation on the Omicron subvariant. “The view is that it is more transmissible, but there is no evidence yet to say that it is more severe,” a source said. There is also ongoing concern about outbreaks in nursing homes.Earlier, Taoiseach Micheál Martin unveiled a portrait of Nphet member Prof Mary Horgan, the first female president of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in its 368-year history. An infectious diseases consultant in Cork University Hospital, Prof Horgan also led the State’s expert advisory group on antigen testing.Another 2,277 PCR-confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported in the State on Monday, while another 3,642 people have registered a positive antigen test through the HSE portal, the Nphet said. As of 8am on Monday, 610 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised, of whom 47 were in ICU. One Government figure said on Monday that about half of the 610 had been admitted to hospital because of Covid-19, while the other half were found to have Covid-19 after being admitted for other reasons.

More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"we have a lot of stories to tell inside nigeria s thriving literary scene","story":"Writers and organisers take to the stage at the annual Lagos Book and Art Festival. Photograph: Sally HaydenIn January the New York Times declared that “2021 was the year for African literature”. “African authors took the literary world by storm in 2021,” read an Al Jazeera headline.It is true that African writers last year won the Nobel Prize for Literature, the Booker Prize, the Camões Prize for Literature, the Prix Goncourt and Hennessy Book Award, among many others. But in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, a literary scene is nothing new.The year in economic capital Lagos is dotted with festivals, including the Lagos International Poetry Festival, which was founded in 2015, usually runs in October, and last year included a one-million-naira (€2,140) winner-takes-all poetry slam.There is also the now nine-year-old Aké Arts and Book Festival, which was founded by Lola Shoneyin, the author of the highly successful The Secret Lives of Baba Segi’s Wives. The hundreds of speakers have included Nigerian-American author Teju Cole Caine Prize for African Writing winner E C Osondu and 26-year-old Nigerian novelist Nnamdi Ehirim.At the most recent iteration of the annual Lagos Book and Art Festival, which has run since 1999, dozens of people sat in a hall to watch discussions which were also broadcast on Zoom. The electricity periodically cut, shutting off the live feed as well as the lights, but the festival continued.Writers read from their recent work, which included ruminations on the Covid-19 pandemic, the Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria’s northeast, and urban police brutality. There was writing about religion, Rastafarianism, and the use of totems as charms. In attendance was Taiwo Ajai-Lycett, an 80-year-old actor and the first editor of Africa Woman magazine, and to whom the 2021 festival was dedicated.There were talks about how authors can “not sell out” and how young writers can be supported in getting into the industry. There were also discussions about whether Nigerian writers should prioritise writing in Pidgin – which is spoken by roughly 50 million people in Nigeria, with versions in Ghana, Liberia and Sierra Leone – rather than English, condemned by some as the language of the coloniser.“We have to find language that will pull the crowd more than English. English is a bastard language,” exclaimed writer Femi Morgan, whose poetry collection, The Year of Fire, was released last year.As in most countries in the world, he later said, life as a writer in Nigeria is not easy financially people do it because it’s their passion. “It’s a long road and you have to consistently push yourself, and when you are done writing you go away and shamelessly sell. The way I sell my poetry my friends are ashamed of me, and I still make losses, but I’m happy doing what I do.”‘A girl with blue eyes’Over the last two decades, domestic concerns about a lack of a reading culture in Nigeria have prompted nationwide drives, such as the government-backed 2010 Bring Back the Book campaign, or Get Nigeria Reading Again, which was launched a year before Nigeria’s fifth largest city, Port Harcourt, took over as Unesco World Book Capital City in 2014.Environmentalist Sola Alamutu uses the Lagos Book and Art Festival to run sessions with schoolchildren focused on promoting literacy. The children’s book author, who runs the organisation Children and the Environment and is nicknamed “the green queen”, said she invites celebrities to speak about the importance of books in their lives.Alamutu says there are challenges in encouraging a love of literature among young Nigerians. “Technology has taken over, children want to go to the movies, look at their phone, just entertain themselves, they don’t want anything too serious. Another thing is that books are expensive and they’re not easily available economically for children...There are still a lot of people who don’t have access to books.”Having a larger number of Nigerian writers helps, she said, because the books children read have historically had little relation to their own lives. “I know a girl who wrote a book about a girl with blue eyes. I don’t know any Nigerian with blue eyes. She was obviously influenced by the books she had read and those books were foreign books...I feel that there should be books from people from different parts of the world.”‘A lot to write about’One of the most well-known bookshops in Lagos is The Jazzhole, which serves as a coffee shop and record store, as well as being packed with new and secondhand books. The walls are lined with work by writers from Pulitzer Prize winner Toni Morrison and Booker Prize winner Salman Rushdie to Zimbabwean author NoViolet Bulawayo, Ethiopian-American writer Dinaw Mengestu and British debut novelist Hafsa Zayyan, who has a Nigerian father.“There’s a lot of substance, a lot of elements, a lot of things to write about,” Tejuoso says about Nigeria. “We have a lot of stories to tell.”His wife, Tundun, says many local writers now self-publish. “It seems important for young writers to write about who they are, what their society is about.”Writing can cause clear cultural shifts, she says. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s work in particular influenced how a lot of women style their hair, and the pride they feel over keeping it natural rather than getting weaves or treating it with chemicals, something the protagonist in Adichie’s much-lauded 2013 novel Americanah talks about. “Black women are now embracing themselves more,” said Tundun.Adichie (44) is the author of numerous books. Her TedX speech, “we should all be feminists”, was sampled by US singer and superstar Beyoncé. Another Adichie Ted talk given in 2009 – “The Danger of a Single Story”, in which she talks about the “incomplete” stories that are told about Africa, which leads to an international impression that it is only “a continent full of catastrophes” – was viewed more than 30 million times.Many of Nigeria’s more recent internationally successful authors are graduates of the Farafina Creative Writing Workshop, which Adichie facilitated for about a decade. They include 34-year-old Ayobami Adebayo, whose debut novel Stay With Me – which deals with polygamy and the pressure on women to have children – was shortlisted for the Baileys Prize and won the Prix Les Afriques Umar Turaki, whose pandemic-related novel Such a Beautiful Thing to Behold comes out in May and Eloghosa Osunde, winner of the Paris Review’s $10,000 2021 Plimpton Prize, whose debut Vagabonds! – a book about “the queer, the poor, the displaced, the footloose and rogue spirits” – will be published in March.‘More resilient’“In the early 1960s, with European colonialism ending all over Africa, Nigeria was at the centre of a new African literary renaissance,” Adichie wrote in 2019. “But cultural production dipped with the military dictatorships of the 1990s, when little fiction was published. Today there is another renaissance, and it feels to me more resilient, more erse, and with less of an obligation to overt politics.”Young Nigerian writers are tackling serious topics, from LGBT+ and transgender rights, as 34-year-old Akwaeke Emezi did in The Death of Vivek Oji to Islamic extremism, like 39-year-old Elnathan John’s Born on a Tuesday but they are also behind everything from sci-fi to memoir to crime.The Booker Prize-longlisted Sunday Times bestseller My Sister the Serial Killer, the debut novel by Nigerian-British writer Oyinkan Braithwaite (33), is set in Lagos, with details about the corrupt police, the crushing rain and the never-ending traffic jams, but the focus of her story is the relationship between two sisters, who could largely have been born anywhere.Braithwaite was a featured spoken word artist in Nigeria’s 2014 Eko Poetry Slam. Her second book, a novella set in Covid-19 times called The Baby is Mine, saw a playboy get locked down with his late uncle’s aunt and mistress, both of whom claim ownership over a newborn baby.While the future of Nigerian writing seems secure, the bookselling industry is less so. The cost of buying hard copies is an impediment for many potential customers, especially given fluctuating exchange rates and the economic impact of the pandemic, said The Jazzhole’s co-owner Tejuoso.“There are a lot of readers but right now, maybe not a lot of buyers. Why buy if you can download or read online? For the younger ones that is more so.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"we must stop him now kyiv emerges from curfew determined to halt putin s advance","story":"A selection of Ukraine citizens - among them: students, computer programmers and actors - speak to reporters from The New York Times as they prepare to take up arms to fight against the Russian invasion.

There were maybe 100 people in each shelter, including lots of children, so we couldn’t take pets down there,” she says.“I couldn’t leave them behind, so the office was ideal. There’s even a small yard for Ace. It also meant several of us could be together and support each other, and we managed to get enough supplies. It’s scary to be alone in the flat at a time like this, just communicating with people on social media,” she explains.“The office building has thick walls so we felt safe there and didn’t have to go down into the metro,” Hanich adds, at time when many thousands of people in Kyiv and Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, are spending long hours underground in station passageways.Air-raid sirens wailed several times over Kyiv in the hours after curfew was lifted, but no one ran for cover in the nearly deserted streets and parks.City outskirtsMost of the booms of missile and artillery strikes are rolling in from the outskirts of Kyiv, where Ukrainian troops and volunteers of the rapidly growing territorial defence force managed to halt Russia’s invasion force about 30km from the city centre.It is not clear how long the defenders of Kyiv and Ukraine’s other main cities can hold out against the heft of Russia’s army, air force and navy, which are being supported by the military of Kremlin ally Belarus, which is just 140km north of the Ukrainian capital.Kyiv also fears that before Russia declared war last week it sent operatives into Ukraine with orders to wreak bloody havoc in major cities and to catch or kill its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and other prominent figures.Hastily erected concrete barriers now force drivers to slow down and slalom past the security service headquarters in the historic heart of Kyiv, and heavy pavement planters, some still holding trees, are strewn across a nearby street as obstacles to traffic.There are now many more guns on the streets, in the hands of soldiers and security service personnel but also wielded by civilian volunteers, and sandbags block doors and windows of the Kyiv city council on the Kyiv’s central avenue.Few shops opened on Monday due to a lack of stock and staff, increasing the likelihood that people could run short of key supplies in the coming days.At the same time, Hanich and others say Ukrainians are banding together like never before to help each other.“I think this feeling of unity, solidarity and support is everywhere in Ukraine now,” she says.“Everyone is trying to keep in touch with friends and relatives, and even with people they may only have met once or twice, to check they have everything they need. I know my neighbours are checking on my flat and taking care of elderly people and children.”Analysts say Russia’s armed forces are having a tougher time in Ukraine than the country’s president, Vladimir Putin, would have expected when he announced his “special military operation” in the early hours of last Thursday.‘Putin miscalculated’Moscow’s apparent bid to replace Ukraine’s pro-western leaders will be made harder if Nato states can make good on pledges to send more weapons to Kyiv, a factor that could make Russian forces use more brutal and indiscriminate methods in a race for victory.“Putin miscalculated,” says Oleh Bespalov, a former military officer and parliamentary deputy, as he takes a break from Nordic walking around a Kyiv park.“He had a plan to cause panic and send in sabotage groups, but did not take into account that the whole world is now connected on social media. Now there is so much support for Ukraine that Putin’s plan could never work,” he argues.“He also completely misunderstood Ukrainians. He thought of them as weak and foolish. He forgot how many people given the Hero of the Soviet Union award were Ukrainian,” adds Bespalov (73).He also believes, like many people, that Putin seriously underestimated Zelenskiy, a television comic before he entered politics just three years ago, who now seems to grow in stature every time he addresses his nation and with every day that Ukraine holds out.“I’m not surprised he didn’t take the American offer of evacuation,” says Bespalov, referring to a report – now already part of Ukraine’s wartime lore – that when the US asked him if he wanted to be rescued, Zelenskiy replied: “I need ammunition, not a ride.”“I always supported him and didn’t like how the opposition disrespected him,” Bespalov says of Zelenskiy (44), who is from a Russian-speaking Jewish family yet is accused by Putin of presiding over a far-right regime that subjects ethnic Russians to “genocide”.Before striding off through the park towards a sweeping view over the Dnieper river, Bespalov says Ukrainians are determined not to be cowed by curfews or Russian aggression.“Life goes on. And if the war goes on, we will all fight,” he says.“And God forbid we let Putin go any further. We must stop him now.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Authors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsAbout 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"almost 1000 people seek compensation severe disability covid","story":"Almost 1,000 people have applied for compensation after claiming to have been left severely disabled by the coronavirus vaccine.A government scheme established in 1979 provides payments of £120,000 to anyone who suffers significant harm as the result of a jab.The tax-free settlements can also be made to the families of those who die after suffering adverse reactions to vaccines.So far a total of 920 applications have been lodged with the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme (VDPS), which if accepted would cost the Government more than £110 million.In order to qualify, the victims must have either died or be able to show they have been left 60 per cent disabled as a result of having a jab.More than 52 million Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in the UK but accurate figures on the number of related deaths are not clear.While official figures put the number of fatalities at nine, statistics from the Yellow Card Scheme - where members of the public or health professionals can report suspected side effects - suggest there have been 79 deaths.Blood clots and immune reactions reportedSome of the reported side effects suffered by those who have taken the jab include blood clots and immune reactions.But establishing a causal link between a vaccination and a health condition can be extremely difficult.Lawyers representing some claimants believe both the assessment system and the payments themselves are outdated and need reviewing.The amount of money paid out by the VDPA since it was launched in 1979 has topped £79 million.A spokesman for the NHS Business Services Authority, which took over the running of the scheme last year, said no payments had yet been made linked to the coronavirus vaccine.The spokesman said: Establishing a link between the Covid-19 vaccines and potential adverse effects has not been straightforward.The spokesman added that applications were being assessed on a case by case basis and staff were being hired to process claims as speedily as possible.More from NewsRussian convoy outside Kyiv may be 40 miles longWant to live longer?

But Yale University has a simpler solution: cold feet.Researchers enrolled 23 people with suspected Covid toes into a study but only three were found to have had the virus. The rate of Covid among those with the condition was no different than the underlying community base rate for the infections. Akiko Iwasaki, Professor of Immunobiology and Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology at Yale said the team had found a lack of association between Covid toes and a coronavirus infection. Although the team said they could not rule out an immune response from an abortive infection they said there were other explanations of how the pandemic could have triggered the rise in cases, such as people not wearing socks and shoes.Well-known phenomenon They also suggested that once ‘Covid toes’ became a well-known phenomenon, people began to attribute their chilblains to the condition. Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the authors said: “An increased incidence of chilblains has been observed during the pandemic and attributed to viral infection. Our results do not support Covid-19 as the cause of the increased chilblain incidence.”These studies better support an alternative explanation for an increase in the incidence of chilblains, possibly attributed to altered behaviour during the pandemic, for example, not wearing socks or shoes at home during quarantine, and or increased awareness due to reports of Covid toe in the media.“In support of this theory, multiple initial encounters in our cohort documented the patient’s concern for Covid toes in the history of present illness, confirming the increased awareness of this entity by patients at the time.Chilblains form after intermittent or prolonged exposure to cold or damp air. The cold air causes blood vessels near the skin\u0027s surface to tighten or constrict, leading to decreased oxygenation and inflammation in these exposed areas. Prof Iwasaki added: “While we do not understand the ultimate driver of pandemic chilblain, our data show that it happens in most cases without detectable signs of infection and immunity.”More from NewsRussian convoy outside Kyiv may be 40 miles longWant to live longer?

While most actors pronounce “SAG” to rhyme with “bag”, Dame Helen demurred.“I hate to say the word ‘sag’ at my age - it’s always S.A.G. for me,” the 76 year-old joked.Addressing her fellow actors at a ceremony in Los Angeles, Dame Helen said: “I’m simultaneously enormously proud and yet I’m riven with the understanding that I absolutely do not deserve this.“I believe you all understand: insecurity versus ego, that cocktail I believe most actors sip of an evening as they contemplate the wonderful gift they received the moment they decided to become an actor.”To laughter and applause, she said: “Lifetime achievement sounds so grand. I suppose I’m still alive, so by that measure I’m eligible. But, honestly, any achievement is the result of my mantra, which is basically, ‘Be on time and don’t be an a--’”Dame Helen also defended the acting profession, a “magnificent tribe”, saying people did not understand how selfless they are.“You know, I get really peed off when I read or hear about actors being maligned as a group. It’s so easy, isn’t it, that lazy and false assumption of vanity when, in my experience - which by now is considerable - the opposite is true. We love and admire each other’s work,” she said.Among other SAG Award winners, the mood was politically charged.Brian Cox, on stage as part of the Succession cast named best ensemble in a drama, urged support for Russian actors too scared to speak out against Vladimir Putin.He said: “The thing that has really distressed me is what’s happening in Russia to our fellow actors and actresses, and performers, writers and critics.“They are told under pain of high treason that they cannot say a word about Ukraine. And I think that is pretty awful. We should all stand together for those people in Russia who don’t like what’s going on - the artists.”There were few British winners at the ceremony. Kate Winslet was named best female actor in a miniseries for Mare of Easttown. The James Bond film, No Time To Die, won the award for best stunt ensemble.The top acting awards in film went to Will Smith, for his role as the father of Serena and Venus Williams in King Richard, and Jessica Chastain for her performance as televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker in The Eyes of Tammy Faye.The top acting prizes in television drama went to Lee Jung-jae and Jung Ho-yeon for Squid Game, the South Korean show that became Netflix’s biggest hit of last year.More from NewsRussian convoy outside Kyiv may be 40 miles longWant to live longer?

Well, he’s not a communist. Yes, he said the collapse of the Soviet Union was the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the 20th century, but if your nation went from superpower to broken gangster-state, you might think that, too – and Putin sees communism as something imposed upon Russia, not an authentic expression of its culture or destiny. He blames it for the very existence of Ukraine.In his GCSE essay “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians”, he noted that in a bid to co-opt Ukraine, the Bolsheviks expanded its borders, and when the USSR collapsed in 1991, many Russians did indeed wake up to find themselves living in new countries (though in Ukraine, many of them voted for independence). Post-Soviet Russia reached back into its past for a new identity, and one point of reference was the Orthodox church. Several of my English friends have converted to it. They admire its mysticism and its masculinity it is a compelling alternative to western churches that have become woolly and irrelevant.In Putin’s Russia, the church has opened thousands of new churches and enjoyed a new role as promoter of national identity, hand-in-glove with the Kremlin. It’s important to stress that many clerics loathe the regime and that Russia has a history of religious dissent. But one compelling symbol of Putin’s attempt to mix faith and politics is the giant statue erected next to the Kremlin of Volodymyr the Great – the 10th-century Viking ruler of Kyiv, whose conversion to Orthodoxy brought Christianity to Rus.His successor, Yaroslav the Wise, builder of the Golden Gate, laid the foundations of a proper state, and Yaroslav has appeared on a Ukraine banknote with a Ukrainian moustache and on a Russian rouble with a Muscovite beard. As historian Serhii Plokhy writes, the search for identity in both nations leads back to holy Kyiv, which gives the Ukrainians an embarrassing edge over Putin. They can be themselves without having to leave their capital. Putin has finally decided that his nation can only enjoy coherence if he occupies it, hence his infamous declaration that “Ukraine is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space.”Four years ago, the Orthodox church in Ukraine split, between those loyal to Moscow, the “new Jerusalem”, and those Ukrainians who declared institutional independence and turned instead towards old Constantinople – a development that Putin denounced, curiously, as inviting “animosity and intolerance”. Just as he calls the defenders of Ukraine Nazis, he often deploys morally-loaded language to justify actions that are transparently self-serving, the sort of duplicity that encourages Westerners to wonder if this man believes in anything at all. Is he a cynic or a fanatic?Can he not be both?Westerners have been trained to think that the primary motivations in life are money or the exercise of inidual rights, and any philosophy that isn’t drily rational is daft, mad or a con trick. We missed the threat from Osama bin Laden in part because we couldn’t process his demand that we vacate the Islamic world, just as most of us assumed Putin wouldn’t invade until last week because his pretext appeared too silly to be serious.It’s not so much that we’re entirely post-religious but rather that we have a take on religion that was shaped by the madness of the First World War – a conflict endorsed by the churches. Following that mindless slaughter, church and state generally drifted apart new currents in theology argued that a more authentic Christianity, closer to the Gospels, was antiwar, meek. Pope Francis calls this the “field-hospital church”: healer, never combatant.To many Westerners, Putin’s mob state, his assassinations and militarism, look to be the very antithesis of Christianity. Yet, as we Westerners do too often, we assume something is universally believed when in fact it is peculiar to us and our time. And we’re so sold on our self-image of absolute reasonableness that we don’t realise that some of the things we choose to do look unreasonable to others. Like Iraq. Or Afghanistan. The Russians and the Chinese regard our accusations of imperialism as hypocritical, and our insistence that they conform to liberal standards as expressions of our own religion. Having denounced Putin on Twitter, the chief of MI6 (hehim) turned his attention to promoting gay history month. This, Putin tells the Orthodox Church, is the sort of thing he is holding the line against.We need greater historical and religious literacy in the West, because even if we think we’ve moved on from our past, which we’ve not, others operate by an ancient script – as the eruption of a religiously-justified war within Europe proves. Of course, some would say that if we better understood the grievances of Russia, we’d know to leave it well alone, much as a well-trained owner knows that when a dog growls, it’s best to walk away.But to those who say, “We brought this on ourselves by humiliating and alienating Russia”, I can only reply that the war is here now, and we have to pick a side. And to those who think Putin at least stands for Christian civilisation, I cannot in a month of Sundays call what he has done a Christian act. He is Goliath, albeit in platform shoes. Ukraine is our century’s David.More from NewsRussian convoy outside Kyiv may be 40 miles longWant to live longer?

The only long-term symptom where the prevalence was significantly higher for those with a positive Covid test was the loss of taste or smell.Just one per cent of primary children and 2.7 per cent of secondary school children met the clinical criteria for long Covid – a positive test, continuous symptoms for at least 12 weeks and everyday life impacted by those symptoms.Russell Viner, professor of child and adolescent health at University College London said: These data emphasise just how common symptoms such as tiredness or headaches are in children and teenagers, regardless of whether they had Covid-19 or not.They found that almost all these symptoms occurred as frequently in those who had never had a positive test compared with those who had. These findings make it clear that research that simply counts issues or symptoms in those who have had Covid or those who haven\u0027t overstates the extent of major problems after infection.The research also highlighted that many children experienced mental health problems during the pandemic, leading experts to warn that they should not be kept away from school again.For primary school pupils, 11.1 per cent of those who had a positive Covid test had a probable mental disorder compared to 7.2 per cent of those who had not had a positive test. For secondary school pupils, 13.9 per cent who had a positive Covid test had a probable mental disorder, compared to 13.6 per cent of those without one.Of primary school pupils who suffered ongoing symptoms for 12 or more weeks – regardless of test status – nearly half had their emotional well-being affected a little or a lot. Some 37.1 per cent had their ability to stay physically active affected by symptoms, and just over a third – 34 per cent – said their education had been impacted.Keeping children in school ‘remains vital’Dr Shamez Ladhani, consultant paediatrician at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and the study\u0027s chief investigator, said: It is reassuring that the vast majority of primary and secondary school aged children surveyed since March 2020 have not experienced long Covid symptoms. These new data should be reassuring for parents, clinicians and policy-makers.Not surprisingly, the study also highlights that some primary and secondary school aged children have described symptoms of emotional, behavioural or hyperactivity conditions. As these findings show that children are at much less at risk of complications from Covid-19 than adults, keeping children in school – where mental health support is available – therefore remains vital.The study, which has been running since March 2020,  involved 134 schools and inputs from the parents of 4,870 pupils.Dr Michael Absoud, honorary reader at the department of women and children\u0027s health at King\u0027s College London, said: There was no significant difference in the numbers presenting with a \u0027probable mental disorder\u0027 between both groups, whether test positive or negative.This likely reflects the high burden of difficulties with emotional wellbeing of children, regardless of Covid-19 test positivity.More from NewsRussian convoy outside Kyiv may be 40 miles longWant to live longer?

Interior Minister adviser Anton Herashchenko said \u0027dozens\u0027 had been killed. As usual, it was Telegram social media channels that brought the news. Images and videos posted by local residents showed the rapid thudda-thudda-thudda of multiple rockets raining down on residential buildings in a northern neighbourhood of the city.Grey clouds and clusters of explosions could be seen as the missiles exploded in a pattern of multiple rocket launch-systems. Then came the close-ups of the aftermath. The smouldering ruins of a children’s clothes shop. Cars aflame in a residential block. A man sitting lifeless at the wheel of his shrapnel-holed Hyundai sedan, the airbag stained with blood from his head. Two men lying dead in the street.And an elderly woman and her severed leg, cut off by a rocket that came crashing through the window of her apartment. She died soon afterwards. This was not the first time Russia has targeted civilians in Kharkiv. Cannon shells and rockets have been slamming intermittently into the tall concrete apartment buildings in Saltivka, a working-class suburb overlooking the eastern ring road, since day one of the invasion. On Saturday night, a woman and her daughter posted a sarcastic “thank you” video to Vladimir Putin in front of their burning cottage after it was hit by shelling. “It’s just what we wanted. You’re a real Tsar and God,” they said, mocking his claim to be protecting ethnic Russians. City authorities said on Monday evening that 87 homes and apartment blocks had been destroyed since the fighting began. But on the whole, the huge Russian army sitting just outside the city has not explicitly or indiscriminately targeted civilians. Some of their operations - including a puzzling and ultimately disastrous assault by unsupported troops in light vehicles on Sunday - seem to have assumed that the local population would be supportive, and that therefore it would be wise not to alienate them.  Those tactics have so far failed to deliver, and many are reading it a deliberate signal of a change to more ruthless tactics.American intelligence officials said a few hours after the strike that Russia was now seeking to encircle the city and were employing siege tactics including “long-range fires”.The current belief is that if they can get Kharkiv and then get Mariupol, if you draw the line between those two cities, you can see that that would allow them to section off the eastern part of Ukraine,” said a senior US defence official. That could mean the kind of unrestrained violence unleashed on Grozny in the 2000s and in Aleppo in 2016. It is a prospect many in this Russian-speaking city would find unthinkable. But the Kremlin is showing growing signs of frustration in its failure to take not only Kyiv, but any other major city, and preparations are clearly underway for a more concerted assault.  Large quantities of artillery, including a TOS-1 thermobaric rocket launcher, have been seen moving south from Belgorod to the Kharkiv front in recent days. Fighter jets were seen over the city on Monday. For all its horror and criminality, Monday\u0027s attack was not sustained - it may have been a demonstration of what could be in store if resistance continues, rather than an all-out assault.  In many other neighbourhoods of this large city, life carried on - in a subdued, frightened way - as normally as possible. “We’re fine, it wasn’t anywhere near us. It’s just as usual as it has been around here,” said a resident of another eastern suburb heavily affected by fighting and shelling the previous day. “But they have totally done in our school. And looting is becoming a problem. When it started everyone went shopping and stocked up, but now those reserves are running out.”He was sceptical about the dangers of a siege. They\u0027re not going to turn this city into Grozny. They don\u0027t need that, he said, pointing out the only shells that had fallen near his house appeared to be strays. The charred remains of School Number 234, which burnt to the ground on Sunday night, have become another much-circulated symbol of the battle of Kharkiv. Some sources said it had been damaged by shelling. But the witness, who lives nearby, said it was destroyed in a gun fight after Russian soldiers who took part in Sunday’s botched attempt to storm the city holed up in the building to make their last stand. It wasn’t clear if any of them survived the battle, and troops across the city remained on high alert for any survivors who may have managed to escape capture.  If the battle for Kharkiv becomes a full-scale siege, many more buildings will burn and hundreds, if not thousands, of civilians may die. \u0027Some attacks could be war crimes\u0027Ukrainian officials initially blamed Grads, the work-horse of Russia’s indiscriminate and devastating rocket artillery units. Others insisted it was a “cluster munitions”, probably deployed by Smerch or Uragan rockets that open up to distribute sub munitions while in flight - as if that constituted some kind of special war crime. Russia has certainly used those already in Kharkiv, including in an attack on a civilian blood donation centre on Friday. We know because the blast patterns - which look like miniature mortar craters - are unmistakable, and because the empty container sections of the rockets used crash to earth about a kilometre beyond the target. They have shown up embedded in roads, gardens and playgrounds across the city. But the distinction is academic. Both weapons are indiscriminate, inaccurate, and designed to kill and maim huge numbers of people over wide areas. Amnesty International said on Friday that the Russian military had shown “blatant disregard for civilian lives by using ballistic missiles and other explosive weapons with wide area effects in densely populated areas” and that “some of these attacks may be war crimes”.Whatever happens, Kharkiv is a city readying for disaster. The last train to Poltava, crowded with people desperate to leave, was unable to leave because of shelling on Monday morning. The driver ordered women and children to lie on carriage floors. On the roads out of town, the  witnessed long queues forming at supermarkets and bank machines in Kharkiv in the morning. The  witnessed large numbers of Ukrainian troops and heavy supply lorries rolled up the still-open highways from the south and west.  The battle here may only be beginning. More from NewsRussian convoy outside Kyiv may be 40 miles longWant to live longer?

That may happen yet. The Ukrainian underdog has put up spirited resistance against a retrograde Russian military machine and President Zelensky – immortalised by the epic phrase “I need ammunition, not a ride”– has become an icon of sovereignty and freedom. The free world has been shamed into matching his heroism, ramping up sanctions and sending weapons. Its action against Russia’s central bank may be a gamechanger, potentially draining Vladimir Putin’s war chest by two thirds.Although Putin has insisted that Russia will never again see revolution, having reached its psychological “limit” for such “cataclysms”, a popular domestic revolt should not be discounted. As the economy goes into freefall, the country’s celebrities are slamming Putin’s war on Instagram. Other elite Russians – from banking tycoons to diplomats – have stuck their necks out, too, to denounce the invasion. Rumours have swirled about the wavering loyalty of members of Putin’s inner circle, including foreign minister Sergei Lavrov.  Still, it may be Xi Jinping who emerges the unlikely anti-hero, compelled to finally twist the knife. Although both China and Russia are united in their hostility to the West, the CCP believes that time is on its side. It is committed to a different gameplan – steadily bending the rules of the liberal order until it breaks, rather than smashing it outright. Beijing has so far refused to openly help Russia to bypass economic sanctions comprehensively. As Putin’s actions become more unhinged and ruthless, Xi may well double-cross the Kremlin.A Ukrainian victory would be a stunning triumph for freedom over tyranny, and show that there is life in Western values yet. Let us hope that it comes to pass. None the less, we ought to consider less positive scenarios. The first is that Putin’s military operation in Ukraine is eventually successful, albeit at astonishing cost. The Kremlin has so far committed considerably less than the full range of forces at its disposal and, despite its evident deficiencies, the Russian military retains an overwhelming combat advantage. Yesterday, we also saw the first indications of what civilians can expect in the coming days: relentless artillery and missile strikes and devastating loss of life. If Putin grows more frustrated with his lack of a tactical breakthrough, he may decide to flatten Ukraine’s resistance as he did the Syrian rebels – including, some have speculated, via the use of chemical or small nuclear weapons. A Russian victory would mark the dawn of a new world order. One in which the glory of empire rivals the sanctity of sovereignty, and sinister ideas of ethnic kinship threaten to usurp modern concepts of nationhood. Pandora’s box would be opened, emboldening China to make a bid for Taiwan and Turkey to formally take chunks out of Iraq and Cyprus. Africa faces balkanisation, as countries erupt into civil war. In an opinion column that has gone viral in China, the social media commentator Zhanhao chillingly asserts: “Many countries will disappear in the coming decades, the inevitable result of unprecedented changes this century... Now it’s alright. There is no medicine for regret. Times have changed.”Such a world would not only be feverish with conflict and empire-building, but ided along new Cold War lines. At best, Ukraine would be “Finlandised”, accepting neutral status, like Helsinki during the Cold War, in return for semi-independence. At worst, it could be partially or wholly absorbed into a Greater Russia. Russia and China would forge closer economic and geopolitical links. Xi has already eased trade restrictions and agreed to increase energy imports from Moscow. Both sides have discussed creating a financial infrastructure to rival Swift. Today, Beijing and Moscow’s mutual solidarity against the West remains largely rhetorical. It could metastasise into a malignant alliance, with the two sides joining forces, on everything from cyberwarfare to the AI arms race.This would be a shock from which the Western world would struggle to recover. But there is an even more catastrophic scenario. One that, at present, remains extremely unlikely, but which cannot be dismissed as impossible either: a direct conflict between Russia and the West. The Kremlin has already raised the temperature. Putin – who may not be of sound mind – not only put his nuclear forces on high alert at the weekend but has radically altered the rules of nuclear war over recent years, by rewriting Russia’s deterrence doctrine. This document asserts that a nuclear war is winnable for Russia, and lowered the bar for deploying atomic weapons, allowing them to be used against non-nuclear strikes.Western politicians, meanwhile, too often treat statesmanship like a social media popularity contest with little thought to the strategic implications of their actions. It is one thing sending defensive armaments to Kyiv, in an attempt to stiffen the Ukrainians’ resolve. It is quite another promising to send fighter jets that might be deemed by Russia to have an offensive purpose, or constitute a declaration of proxy war – as the EU did at the weekend. There is thus the non-negligible risk war might erupt by accident. We also underestimate at our peril the extent to which Ukraine may be a do-or-die issue for Putin. In the mind of Russia’s dictator, empire and survival are one and the same. Convinced that Moscow’s nuclear arsenal is the only thing that has prevented the West from attempting Iraq-style regime change, he is adamant that great power status is the only way that Russia can avoid domination by the West. By his gnarled logic, Ukraine is the key, for which he is willing to risk everything. A Russia without it is doomed to oblivion – diminished, encircled by enemies and slowly strangled by the kind of economic sanctions that the West does not dare level on China. If he thinks victory in Ukraine demands direct action against Kyiv’s allies, can we be sure that he wouldn’t take it?Putin’s nihilistic fanaticism, in short, could alter the course of history not just for Ukraine but the world. The West must urgently respond with less romanticism and more realism.  More from NewsRussian convoy outside Kyiv may be 40 miles longWant to live longer?

Observers went home afterwards, while the troops lived in the fallout at Christmas Island for up to a year Image: MirrorpixopinionByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  Feb |commentsSeventy years ago this October, Britain detonated its first atomic bomb. The  further nuclear weapon trials ious governments conducted over decades are the reason why, today, Vladimir Putin probably isnapost going to irradiate the UK by teatime. And for the past  years, the servicemen who delivered our nuclear deterrent have been saying they got cancer as a result. That their wives miscarried repeatedly. That children were born with defects - deformities, poor plumbing, extra teeth.To every complaint, each government said the same: there is no evidence. Until Thursday morning, when, just as Putin rolled his tanks into Ukraine, officials published an update to a government study into the health of the nuclear test veterans.  Read the full story of Britainaposs nuclear tests at DAMNED And for the first time it said they were right. They are more likely to die and get cancer. Seven decades after developing a weapon always intended to be physically and genetically devastating to any living thing exposed to it, government scientists admitted that a long-term detrimental health effect associated with participation in the tests cannot be completely ruled out.It took a day to digest the -page report, packed with statistical tables, but the figure which jumped out was that test veterans were . times more likely to die from chronic myeloid leukaemia, a type of bone cancer that, the report says, is radiation-inducible. A further  pages of supplementary material establishes % of the crew of HMS Diana, a warship ordered twice to sail through fallout, had died, almost all from tumours. They show that RAF ground crew who washed down planes that had flown through the mushroom clouds were  times more likely to die from leukaemia. Read moreAnd, perhaps most devastatingly for all those governments which twisted reality and logic to deny these men the truth, suicide rates were excessive in every single decade since the tests began. But something wasnapost right. \" target\"_self\" rel\"nofollow\"This study began in , with updates in  and . They backed up the government line to such an extent veterans called them a cover-up and whitewash. The new one was ordered in , after the Mirror launched a medal campaign. The authors say the extra  years made it possible to study in more detail and with greater statistical certainty the potential lelong health impact of test participation. Yet on page , the report compares all this extra information with studies from before : reports which do not have that detail. How was it possible, we asked the researchers, to compare, when this is the first time weaposve seen it  We were told that the previous three reports were summary papers, and published alongside them at the same time were companion reports with extra data. Veterans, families, campaigners, lawyers, and war pension advocates were amazed. This was the first time they had been told the first  studies were summaries, and that there was anything extra. We asked when and where these companion reports were published. We were told they all have ISBN numbers, and were available from government agencies. And they were mentioned in the summaries.With the latest study, all  have now been put online. So we had a look at the first, which was only ever available previously in paper format. It was  pages long, and published in the British Medical Journal on January , . Nowhere within it does it state that there is extra detail in a companion report.What there is, is a footnote. It could be identied as the right reference only because it mentions a code also used on the front page of the companion report. This report could be found onlyyou already had it. This footnote is referenced in the paper just twice, and says merely that the companion report describes methodology and verication checks. There is no mention, whatsoever, of it containing DATA . But this extra information is eye-opening. Spread across  pages, it shows test veterans are . times more likely to die from leukaemia, . times more likely to die from bladder cancer, and raised rates of suicide. And thereaposs a table showing  test veterans dead from chronic myeloid leukaemia, compared to none in the control group, a statistically-signicant figure with a low rate of probability, which means men at the nuclear tests were  TIMES more likely to get a radiation-inducible bone cancer than anyone  in the population.A call to the Stationery Office established that not one copy of this companion report had even been published, not once in  years.  It is entirely possible, therefore, that you are one of the first people in the world to ever see what the British state has known for most of your le: that men ordered to take part in experiments weaponising radiation were more likely to die as a result.Despite knowing that, the state fought every war pension claim and court case. It issued denials to every Daily Mirror story. It sent ministers to the Despatch Box to say there was no evidence. It did it all using millions of pounds of taxpayersapos money - your money.Thousands of test veterans have died, uncompensated and unrecognised, because no-one told them about the companion reports. Hundreds of thousands of children have been born to parents who ask a doctor why, and the doctor just shrugs, because this data was hidden in the footnotes. Decades have rolled slowly by while whole families of men who served their country went in and out of hospital, lost jobs, lost faith, and grieved for those who took their own lives. Ministers were briefed by advisers, who read the reportaposs front page which blames smoking and says that, overall there was no detectable effect on health from the tests. Editors and defence reporters in a once-angry media listened to briefings from the MoD, and shrugged the story away. Read more Even veterans and lawyers, who pored over these documents, had no reason to think there was proof within them that radiation-linked bone cancer could be linked to explosions of plutonium isotopes that have been considered toxic and bone-seeking almost since their discovery. Yet here it is, hidden in the open, unpublished but publishable, something that has never existed in physical form and which can be seen only to those whoaposve seen it already. It takes a special level of deviousness to cover something up while at the same time covering your own arse to effectively hide something in a microdot, so that you can always say it was published at the time.It could be argued that the passage of time has made the test veteran data clearer, and the figures worse. As some of these illnesses are more common with age, there is a clearer comparison with the control group. But it is indisputable that at least those  men who died from radiogenic bone cancer within  years of the tests could have had a war pension from the moment they fell ill. Their widows,they were married, could have had a pension too they could have had faith. Instead they were denied even a medal by a state which puts itself above the people it serves.It would have cost us two things: a fraction of the money spent fighting the veterans, and the pride of an Establishment which is simply unable to admit it ever did wrong. Both would have been worth paying, and weaposd have a finer country for it. One which, perhaps, that would never have let a despot who puts radiation in a pot of tea be in a position to invade anywhere.

But he could lose his Motability car before the case is even heard by a judgeCameron Mitchell and mum Nicola Clulow, who has launched a court challenge over a DWP ruleByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsA man who can’t walk or speak fears losing his adapted car midway through a High Court battle over his disability benefits. Cameron Mitchell, , from Carlisle, suffers frequent seizures and muscle spasms and is fed through a tube, according to his lawyers Leigh Day.But his Personal Independence Payment, and his mothers’ Carer’s Allowance, were stopped because he spent  days in hospital to June last year. PIP is worth up to £. a week to help with the costs of being disabled. But it is only paid for the first  days of a stay in a care home, hospital or prison. Cameron’s mum Nicola Clulow was given permission last week to fight a High Court judicial review against the -day rule, which her lawyers say breaches human rights law on discrimination. But while the battle is ongoing, the family have faced demands tohis PIP-funded Motability car.  While the Department for Work and Pensionsagreed to stop clawing back overpayments for at least six months, the mobility element of his PIP - used to fund the car - was still clawed back in late . They were initially asked tothe Motability car by this Thursday. After the Mirror intervened, Nicola was told the date had been extended to June . But that would still be before the High Court hearing in Cameron’s case, which is currently due on June . Lawyers say Cameron is spending half his week in a care home and half in hospital and needs the car to get between the two. His mum Nicola said: “Heaposs  years old and has had to spend days and nights for months watching very sick people who often donapost survive. “Despite his lack of communication, itaposs clear to everyone that he was switching off from the world, was depressed and just had no interest in le.“Contact with the outside world and the ability to go home to be with family are crucial for him. “To go out, and especially to go home, Cameron requires a great deal of equipment to go with him and this would be impossible without his Motability car.“Having been called on  February  by Motability to say his vehicle must be ed on Thursday  March was one of the most dficult and upsetting situations we have faced.“It means that Cameron will once again have to simply stay looking at the four walls of the Intensive Care unit and not get home.”DWP officials argue the -day limit is a long-standing rule that stops people being funded twice at the same time, by the NHS and the benefit system.But Nicolaaposs case is backed by evidence from Mencap, Carers UK and Marie Curie.She argues that even though Cameron was in hospital, she still needed to provide essential care - including spotting when a seizure was imminent, communicating with him and helping him move around.Leigh Day solicitor Carolin Ott said: “We are very pleased that the court has granted our client permission for a judicial review of the hospitalisation rule which has suspended his PIP and his mother’s Carer’s Allowance. “But [we] are deeply concerned by the detrimental impact of the enforcement of the rule whilst Cameron awaits his day in court.“Cameron is a young man with profound and multiple learning disabilitiesand like many others with PMLD is dependent on input from his known carers.“In circumstances where the NHS alone can’t cover his care needs, his PIP should have never been suspended in the first place.” A Motability spokesperson said: “Should the DWP decide to suspend a customer’s allowance due to hospitalisation, Motability Operations will make contact with the customer to understand the nature of suspension. “The Scheme is only able to supply cars, powered wheelchairs or scooters to those in receipt of a qualying allowance. “Motability Operations have been supporting the Clulow family, however given the exceptional nature of this case and the ongoing legal review, Motability Operations will be contacting Mrs Clulow to discuss what further support they may be able to offer given the family’s current inidual circumstances.” A DWP spokesperson said: “We do not comment on live litigation.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSDepartment for Work and PensionsCameron MitchellHospitalsCare homesHuman rightsNursing homes\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Government is introducing the requirement to protect patients from botched non-surgical cosmetic procedures.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said “far too many people have been left emotionally and physically scarred” when things have gone wrong.The plan will come in an amendment to the Health and Care Bill being tabled tomorrow. The Government believes pressure from social media has contributed to a surge in young adults wanting cosmetic surgery. Mr Javid said: “While most of those in the aesthetics industry follow good practice when it comes to patient safety, far too many people have been left emotionally and physically scarred after botched cosmetic procedures.  “I am committed to protecting patient safety by making it an offence for someone to perform these cosmetic procedures without a licence. “We’re doing all we can to protect patients from potential harm, but I urge anyone considering a cosmetic procedure to take the time to think about the impact on both their physical and mental health and ensure they are using a reputable, safe and qualied practitioner.”The Health and Care Bill has been controversial with unions warning it will be a major reorganisation that will cement the role of the private sector in the NHS.The Government stands accused of a “power grab” as the new bill hands the Health Secretary powers over the day to day running of the NHS. Currently it sets general funding and salary structures but operational decisions are made independently by the NHS leadership.Health Minister Maria Caulfield said the spread of images online via social media has led to a rise in demand for botox and fillers. She added that there had been a subsequent increase in people suffering the consequences of badly-performed procedures. She said: “While these can be administered safely, we are seeing an unacceptable rise in people being left physically and mentally scarred from poorly performed procedures. “Today’s amendment is the next step on the road to effective regulation of non-surgical cosmetic procedures in England.” A public consultation will first be launched to representation from patients and interested parties. It follows new legislation making it illegal to give such treatments to under-s, and banning adverts - including social media - for cosmetic procedures which target people in that age group.

The former Cabinet minister was forced to resign last year after leaked CCTV showed him in a clinch with adviser Gina Coladangelo in his Whitehall office. The footage was taken on May  , when indoor social gatherings of people from dferent households were banned under law and guidance urged people to stay two metres apart and avoid face to face contact.Mr Hancock initially clung onto his job and Boris Johnson was criticised for failing to sack him. But the following day he resigned after admitting he had broken his own Covid guidance. In a y interview with the Diary of a CEO podcast, Mr Hancock said he fell in love and it all happened quite quickly - but insisted he did not break the law. Clad in a navy polo neck, the senior Tory spoke atabout the affair, which brought an abrupt end to his Cabinet career. He said: We fell in love and thataposs something that was completely outside of my control. Of course I regret the pain thataposs caused and the very, very public nature - anybody who has been through this knows how dficult it is, how painful it is. Mr Hancock said he fell in love with Ms Coladangelo - whom he has known since his student days - while they were working together at the Department for Health and Social Care. He left his we and children to start a relationship with Ms Coladangelo, who was also married with children. The West Suffolk MP said: It all happened quite quickly, It actually happened after the rules were lted, but the guidance was still in place. So I’m not trying to claim that, I hold no bitterness about this because I broke the rules, I fess up, I broke the guidance.” He went on: “I resigned because I broke the social distancing guidelines by then. They weren’t actually rules. They weren’t the law. But that’s not the point. The point is they were the guidelines that I’d been proposing. And that happened because I fell in love with somebody.”  Mr Hancock admitted to breaking his own guidance when he dramatically quit his Cabinet post last year.In his letter to Boris Johnson at the time, he wrote: We have worked so hard as a country to fight the pandemic. The last thing I would want is for my private le to distract attention from the single-minded focus that is leading us out of this crisis.I want to reiterate my apology for breaking the guidance, and apologise to my family and loved ones for putting them through this. I also need be with my children at this time.In a video posted on Twitter at the time, Mr Hancock admitted he had to go, saying: I understand the enormous sacrices that everybody in this country has made, you have made.And those of us who make these rules have got to stick by them and thataposs why Iaposve got to resign. Mr Hancock was also grilled on his handling of the pandemic - and said he would still have taken the job evenheaposd known Covid was coming. “When the really bad stuff happens and you’re in the job, you got to stand up and be counted,” he said. The senior Tory admitted ministers knew that some of the measures they took during the pandemic were very damaging. “The costs of action are huge, the cost of inaction are also huge,” he said. “So we knew when we were sitting around the cabinet table making these decisions that the balance between these two was an enormous unknown. So with an unprecedented virus with very little data, we were essentially doing these things that we knew weaposre going to be very damaging.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusMatthew Hancock MP\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mr Malthouse was accused of ignoring women as he can go home without looking over his shoulder while many women canapost. A senior official told the Mirror it was quite ironic the Government were launching a campaign to protect violence against women and girls as MPs blocked a bill to make misogyny a hate crime. MPs voted  to  with a majority , to remove the Lords amendment which had aimed to make misogyny a hate crime. The Policing Minister said a communications campaign called “Enough” to encourage bystanders and peers to report such behaviour to the police.  The campaign launch tonight was received with mixed reviews from leading campaigners, charities and activists working to end violence against women and girls, the Mirror understands.Weeks before MPs voted on the amendments, Home Secretary Priti Patel is understood to have written to MPs demanding they back her bill as too many criminals were getting off with light sentences.Lucy Allan MP for Telford, was the only Conservative MP to vote against scrapping the amendment, to make misogyny a hate crime. MPs shared compelling accounts of abuse and harassment in the Commons. Caroline Noakes told MPs: If weaposre going to go to the Law Commissionaposs recommendations around misogyny and the complications theyaposve highlighted, we should also be looking at public sexual harassment. This feels like a missed opportunity. It absolutely matters. If weaposre going to start tackling the cultures that underpin male violence to women. Siobhan Baillie Tory MP for Stroud supported Ms Noakes and added: We have to recognise the calls for these changes are from young girls experiencing really tough times everywhere.  Labour MP Stella Creasy said police forces had found it helpful to record data on sex or gender acting as a motivating factor for crimes, including on recognising patterns of behaviour. “Many women will have experienced sexual harassment. They’ll have experienced abuse online, offline in our daily lives to such an extent it infuses what we do. “The flinch when you come out of a tube station to make sure there’s nobody behind you, carrying your keys in your hand, worrying about what your daughter is wearing, hoping that your son isn’t one of those people who does it.” Ms Creasy also said: “The problem for the minister is he says he listens to women, he knows women, he understands this area. Buthe understands at all he should listen to the suffragettes who told us it was deeds, not words that matter.  And all we’ve heard tonight is words. Buthe continues to ignore women,he continues to say that he understands the challenge, to blame them for not coming forward and report things … he’s right to shake and thrash his head, but he can probably go home without looking over his shoulder. Many of us can’t.” In the same session, the Government voted against plans to make it easier to prosecute landlords who take sex for rent from vulnerable Brits. The Mirror revealed the Government would block the amendment passing through which Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper blasted as sickening Shadow Home Office minister Sarah Jones said: “I would urge the House to consider two amendments in this grouping which the Government is tonight rejecting which would make a real dference to women’s lives.”The controversial Bill was torn apart by peers, including the proposals from the Government designed to combat the protest tactics adopted by groups including Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyLiberal DemocratsHome OfficePriti PatelKit MalthouseSarah JonesCrimeDomestic violencePoliticsHate crime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ukraine will prove the fatal, final mistake by a fascistic gangster who egotistically believed his own invincible propaganda after strategic triumphs in Crimea and Syria, and the  Trump and Brexit blows delivered to the US and UK. Vlad the Invader’s twitchy finger on the nuclear trigger and the offer of Potemkin negotiations are both signs even he fears this is an impending personal Armageddon. This is fuelled by brave Ukrainians fighting heroically and Russians courageously protesting “No to War”, which is inspiring resistance around the world. Supplying anti-tank, helicopter and aircraft missiles strengthens defenders and weakens attackers already suffering punishing losses. Britain, the rest of Europe and the US finally uniting over economic and cultural sanctions will eventually bankrupt the Putin machine and perhaps drive a deep wedge between the tyrant and his billionaire cronies who enjoy opulent luxury wherever they please.  And China abstaining instead of vetoing a UN Security Council motion by the US condemning the brutal invasion emphasised Putin’s isolation, as a new ally quickly distanced itself from an ageing, deranged dictator. The bloody conflict could still belong: reducing Ukrainian neighbourhoods to rubble, inflicting unbearable heartache and costing countless lives. What is becoming clearer, however, is that Putin is also likely to be one of the victims. But let’s not buy charlatan Boris Johnson’s propaganda that he is suddenly an international statesman, a Prime Minister orchestrating the resistance. Johnson let Putin walk all over him and Britain, with oligarchs smirking unconcerned whenever ruling Conservatives, reliant on Russian-linked money, talked tough then acted soft.Charismatic, cool-headed, defiant Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelensky is what a real leader looks and sounds like. Germany’s centre-Left Olaf Scholz is also rising to the occasion, standing up to Putin at considerable financial expense. A European Union that Johnson ripped Britain from as part of a career move was firmer on sanctions until shamed Johnson started running to catch up. Locking out Ukrainian refugees fleeing terror unless they apply to be fruit pickers is disgraceful and inhuman, when Poland, Romania and Hungary open their borders. Why not seize the spacious British properties of Russian oligarchs to house Putin’s casualties  I’ve watched and known Johnson for longer than the  years Putin has misruled Russia. So I’m aware of the cynicism of the great charlatan. From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times. The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK  world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis.You can sign up here.  The first casualty of war is Partygate, with Johnson relieved that the shells and missiles are effectively providing a smokescreen. If he’s hit by a fine, the PM will pray it is today. Now wouldn’t be the moment to remove a lawbreaker in Downing Street, his apologists will argue. They’d be wrong, of course. Chamberlain was dumped by MPs to be replaced by Churchill during the Second World War then, before Japan finally surrendered, the country swapped Churchill for Attlee. Labour leader Keir Starmer will inevitably receive less airtime than the PM but should have calculated that he must be constructively critical rather than mercilessly pummelling the Tory rogue. War in Europe might save Johnsonnot an invaded country or Putin.

It was pretty terrying throughout my whole pregnancy not knowingthat was going to be the outcome again, she said. Hoping for the best but knowing thereaposs always a possibility that things might not go as planned.Recalling her first scan, Odalis said she had to go in alone while Antonio, , waited outside due to Covid restrictions.She said: I was just so scared that they were going to tell me aposoh, thereaposs no heartbeatapos so I was so anxious the whole time I was texting Antonio like aposIaposm so scaredapos. The doctor comes in and Iaposm trying to mentally prepare myself for anything and when she found the first baby and the heartbeat I was crying with so much happiness. And then she started going back and forth and I was wondering why - my mind just went to the worst-case scenario because of the traumatic experience that we had. Thataposs when she told me that she had found another baby that also had a heartbeat. I was just crying with happiness. I felt like the first baby that we had lost was in the room with me and saying it was going to be ok.  She claims the doctor then told her something remarkable - that her babies werenapost technically twins and had been conceived five days apart. The mum-of-two said her due date was set in the middle - two days after one baby would have been  weeks and two days before the other one would have been  weeks. And on  August , babies Lilio and Imelda arrived safely, weighing lbs oz and lbs oz respectively. Odalis said: I feel like itaposs some sort of miracle that I experienced this double pregnancy. Because of our first experience, it made everything during this pregnancy feel so much more special and magical.  Just how easy I was able to conceive, and knowing that I had two babies, I just felt like there was so much light after such a dark place. It was the best surprise ever. It was a really beautul moment to finally be able to hold them in my arms. The full-time mum said the girls are a blessing - but admits the pair look so similar, she and Antonio sometimes mix them up. In fact, the duo look so alike that Odalis says she tells people they are twins rather than explaining how they were conceived.Theyaposre technically not even identical but everyone thinks that they are. They definitely look a lot alike, she said.Antonio will have a baby for an hour and be like aposoh Liloapos this and that and Iaposm like aposyou have Imeldaapos and he will be like aposwhat apos and Iaposm just there laughing because he was like aposoh my God for a whole hour I thought I had Liloapos.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PregnancyMiscarriageTwins\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Agata Casey, of Southend-on-Sea, said she made the decision to stock up on supplies to send to Ukrainian refugees at the Polish border after seeing messages on social media about a nearby restaurant collecting donations. The -year-old mother of two said she went to her local Aldi with a friend on Sunday afternoon to purchase sanitary pads, wet wipes and nappies to take in as donations.Ms Casey, a dental hygienist, told The Mail Online the pair had been careful to leave stock behind for other people. However, upon attempting to pay for their items, she claims they were told they were not allowed to buy “all of the stock”. In response, Aldi claimed they offered to bulk order stock for Ms Casey to collect in two days’ time. A spokesperson attributed the workers’ reactions to Ms Casey’s haul to their store policy to try to allow customers to buy “as much stock as possible” - but to ensure there is “enough stock for other shoppers”. Ms Casey and her friend were only allowed to buy £. worth of items, she said, while the remaining stock they had intended to buy was ed to the shelves. Footage captured by Ms Casey’s friend allegedly shows an Aldi worker putting nappies back into a trolley to put back on shelves due to “shortages” in the UK. Ms Casey said the incident made her feel like a “rat” who was “looting” for wanting to buy donations for Ukrainian refugees. She said: “I was asked like a rat to put this back on the shelves because I am looting Aldi in Southend for Ukrainian people and how dare I. This is how it felt.”The inspiration to buy the items for Ukrainian refugees came from a Facebook post on page Polacy W Southend-on-Sea, she said.The appeal said a lorry would be travelling to Poland on Saturday filled with stock to help refugees. It urged people to drop off donations at Polish restaurant Domowe obiady U Babci, such as long-le food, blankets and hygiene items. She had wanted to do what she could to help during the “biggest crisis of our letime”, she said. Ms Casey added that her parents, who live in Kraków, were taking in refugees in a bid to help.  She and her friend had been conscious about leaving some stock behind for other people, Ms Casey said. The mum claimed they only bought several packs of nappies in a handful of sizes. However, she said she could sense “tension” around her from customers and staff after they loaded up the trolley. As the pair were queueing for the till, Ms Casey said there had been an announcement calling a manager. She initially thought something had happened with the cashier and she would have to move queues, but then realised it was because of her purchase. She claims she was then told by the manager that she could not buy the amount of stock they had selected and would have tosome to the shelves. Explaining her confusion over the debacle, Ms Casey said it wasn’t as though there was a shortage, as there had been during periods of the pandemic. Determined to gather more stock, Ms Casey said she went to Lidl afterwards, where she was told she was allowed to buy nappies in larger quantities. She also went to Farmlands to pick up long-le food supplies and encountered no issues with buying large quantities of groceries.Ms Casey said the experience left her wanting to “cry”, and said she was just trying to do “everything” she could to help the Ukrainian refugees fleeing the country amid Russia ’s invasion.She said: “I just felt unwelcome, I just felt like crying in the middle of that shop.

I joined HMRC as an adminis­trative assistant in  – never in a million years would I have thought I’d still be here  years later. But I worked with people I really admired and made good friends. When I started out it was all about admin tasks like filing and sending the brown envelopes people hate. But I was quickly promoted and I learned so much. In March  I was promoted to my current role as customs fraud lead in the Fraud Investigation Service [FIS]. I only manage four people and we’re never going to be glamorous – there are no dawn raids or exciting seizures. The aim is for our team to use our knowledge to lead the FIS to serious customs fraud. I was lucky enough before the pandemic to be part of a team that travelled to Namibia, Madagascar and Tanzania to share how HMRC approaches customs risk. We were presenting to each country and listening to the experiences of their tax authorities. For me it was an amazing opportunity to see how our counterparts work. I’m also customs race lead in Wales. In the past couple of years I’ve really centred my attention on ensuring equality of opportunity for colleagues. In Cardf we’ve set up mentoring, coaching and sponsorship with help from senior leaders. It’s about  per cent of my job and it’s completely changed my le. I’ve had a lot of support from others and I thought maybe I can support others.aposMy job is just so rewardingapos I was originally planning to study politics at Newcastle, but one day I decided to have a quick browse on the Civil Service apprenticeship website. I’d always wanted to work in government and it seemed such an incredible opportunity. I applied on a bit of a whim and went through the interview rounds, and then did a presentation on why more young people need to get involved in politics – but I never thought I’d get in. At first it was a bit of an overwhelming experience, going into these great buildings. You can’t believe you’re in this position, seeing all these really senior people in this massive government office. It took time to get my head around that, getting off the Tube every day with Big Ben behind me. I’m just a normal person! Now I’ve been working here for three months and it’s been great – although it feels like a lot longer because I’ve learned so much. Being in the centre of the Cabinet Office I get involved in lots of dferent areas, so I’m in the community and engagement team for the central GCS team, working on internal newsletters as well as helping run the social media channels. I get paid a full-time salary and still spend  per cent of my time studying. Before taking the apprenticeship I was worried about not making friends like you do in university. But I am part of a large cohort of apprentices and so have had lots of opportunities to socialise with them. I think about  per cent of apprentices go on to get a job. After this I’d like to do something in climate communications, maybe for another COP [Conference of the Parties]. The apprenticeship is  months and so there’s always the option to go back to universityyou decide that it’s not for you.But I think the vast majority of people decide that it is for them. I think it’s really magical. It’s just so rewarding, knowing that every day you’re working to hopefully benefit people, working to help make changes and save lives. aposNo two days are the sameapos When I tell people I’m a civil servant – in particular for HMRC – I get lots of jokes about being lazy, having nothing to do and can I do anything about their VAT s. I never go into specics about my actual role because I am fairly sure it would leave people baffled, but hopefully my career to date shows the Civil Service can be an incredibly rewarding place to work. I joined the Civil Service in  as a frontline manager for contact-centre advisers dealing with the introduction of tax credits, and also worked in HR for four years. After nearly  years, I gained my G promotion to a senior project manager working on delivering IT projects across the entirety of HMRC. This was followed by a brief secondment to the Northern Ireland Office as a senior policy adviser on EU Exit. I then came back to HMRC and moved across into my current role in January. There’s the opportunity to move into dferent professions, and the plethora of jobs available mean that you can continue to grow and learn from each role. No two days are the same and the people I work with are fantastic.aposIt’s very family friendlyapos One thing that I’ve been pleasantly surprised by is how supportive and inclusive the Civil Service is. Being a working mum to Henry, six, and four-year-old Harriet, I think it’s really important to have some flexibility and bring your whole self to work. It’s very family friendly. I work  hours over a four-day week. My managers were very supportive of my request to work Monday to Thursday. My little girl has some signicant health issues, so having that flexibility is so important to me. Tech is usually male dominated in the private sector, but it’s been a refreshing surprise to find that the balance is much better in the Civil Service. Two female staff above me also do a four-day week, so there’s the opportunity to look at that career trajectory. Here in the government financethere’s a good gender balance, lots of ersity and dferent skill sets that people bring to the team. I think it definitely reflects the people in the country we serve, which is exactly what it should do. The civil service is very good at looking at people’s transferable skills rather than overlooking youyou haven’t worked in the same job before. For me, I like doing a role that adds value in society and I’ll hopefully have a career where I can succeed and get promoted. As a working mother, that’s absolutely possible here. Training opportunities are a real strong point, too – from courses to mentoring. I work hard, but I like having the balance and flexibility. That’s worth more to me than pound notes would be. The Civil Service is a unique organisation and you get to be involved in things that make a dference to people around the country. It’s really quite special.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON HMRCThe TreasuryNorthern Ireland OfficeEducationPensionsSchoolsTaxCivil servantsPublic servicesBenefitsTax CreditsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"couple deliver baby second time","story":"Couple deliver own baby for second time after road works block way to hospitalDominic Lister, , leapt into action when his we Natalie, , went into labour in their campervan but it wasnt their first rodeo - he had already helped her give birth at home three years beforeDominic Lister, Natalie Lister, son Elliot Lister, and baby Alice Lister with their camper van Dominic had already helped deliver Elliot so when Alice was born on the side of the A he knew what to do Image: Tom Maddick   SWNSByAdam DuttonJoe Smith:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments A couple delivered their own child by the side of the road after roadworks forced them to pull over on the way to hospital. Dominic Lister, , leapt into action when his we Natalie, , went into labour in their campervan, but it wasnapost their first rodeo - he had already helped her give birth at home three years before.The funeral director calmly helped deliver his daughter Alice, who was born weighing lb oz, in the middle of the A near Nottingham on February . Dominic had done the same Natalie gave birth to their lb oz baby son Elliot at their home in Bingham without medical help in . The dad-of-two, who has worked in the funeral business for  years, said it was special bringing le into the world given it was the opposite of his usual day job.He added: Itaposs certainly very dferent to my day job. Itaposs the opposite to what I do really but I think being a funeral director actually helped with staying calm. My daily role involves me being calm and reassuring. It takes many years of experience. But helping deliver my own child is not something that I ever expected to have to do. To have done it twice is very special. Iaposve been the first person in the world, for a brief moment, to have held them. Teaching assistant Natalie added: It will be such a nice story to tell the children when they grow up, itaposs unique but definitely not what we planned. He certainly upped the dficulty this time. We were in the dark, in the cold outside, both trying not to panic and there was just nowhere to go. But sometimes needs must, and it was four blokes and an RAC man, and you just have to get on with what you have got to do.  The coupleaposs latest drama came after they tried to make it to Nottinghamaposs Queenaposs Medical Centre when Natalieaposs waters broke at around pm. But they faced ersions and roadworks which meant they were left with no choice but to pull over at around .pm before Alice arrived  minutes later. Several workmen and an RAC recovery driver came to the aid of the pair, while Natalie gave birth to Alice in the back of the vehicle. Dominic explained: It was Monday evening, and we were at home. Nat was sat on the sofa and started having a few twinges. Jokingly I said: aposAre you sure this time apos About pm in the evening, Natalie comes in and tells me that her waters have gone so I put everything in the campervan as it was at the end of the drive. We set off to hospital but a road was closed and we were erted as a lorry in front of me went along at what felt like mph.  We go onto the A and that was coned off. We stopped and I was talking to the workmen. She opened the door and she said the baby was coming now. I thought aposoh no, here we go againapos. It was just a case of keep calm and carry on. An RAC truck pulled up and put his warning lights on to make sure we could be seen while the workmen were calling the ambulance team. But there wasnapost enough time. The delivery was smooth and it was just a case of keeping Natalie and the baby as warm as possible.  I upped the dficulty by doing it in the middle of the A. I wonapost be doing it again though, this is the last one. The staff at the hospital jokingly askedI wanted a job as a midwe - but I said I think delivering two is more than enough. Dominic had helped Natalie give birth to their first child Ethan, now two, at home while a  operator talked him through what to do. He added: With Elliot, Nat started having little twinges about   in the morning. I was at home and we thought aposthataposs it, heaposs coming.apos It got to am and then we realised he was on his way.  I rang the hospital and they knew we were coming. I put all the stuff in the car and came back inside. As we got to the doorstep, she said this is happening now. I rang an ambulance and explained the situation. It happened very quickly. The gentleman at the ambulance control centre talked me through what to do. Knowing the ambulance was on the way was good. He arrived at :am and two minutes later the crew arrived. I was a little bit in shock and I never dreamed Iaposd have to do it again.

The wood machinist from Milton Keynes started building the creepy enclosures four years ago and is in the process of building more for all  spiders to have their own terrying homes. Steve said: I watch nothing but horror movies so thought to bring the two together it mixes my two passions.  The enclosures are more the obsession now than the spiders, to be honest. The thing with spiders is that some of them are really quite boring and you never see them. So, I figured thatyou built something really cool, you still have something to look at. My favourite enclosure is the Friday the th one, I think itaposs because itaposs one of my favourite horrors. Iaposm doing the American Werewolf in London, at the minute, itaposs a classic!  The list goes on, whenever Iaposm out people are telling me that I need to do this one, and I need to do that one. Usually when Iaposm finishing one, I have the next two, three, four planned already. Iaposve done a lot of s classics, The Evil Dead, Hellraiser, Elm Street, the Alien films, Michael Myers Halloween. Itaposs quite cool, when youaposre sitting down watching a film in the living room and all the lights are off, itaposs eerie.  As a father of an autistic son, Steve has managed to raise over £ for charity after auctioning some of his enclosures at spider shows in the UK. He said: Iaposve sold a couple for charity work that I do. I build some and auction them off at charities. My little boy has autism, so I did a big thing last year where we did loads of raffles and built an enclosure. They have spider shows here in the UK and we auctioned off an enclosure at one of the shows which was quite cool.  The enclosures do take some time with some taking a couple of months to build. Steve was introduced to the world of spiders after a work colleague revealed his collection. However, Steve still remains fearful of house spiders. Steve said: I got into it through a mate that I worked with. Before I met the guy and went around to his house to see them, I had no interest, and I had a fear of them as well. But theyaposre not like normal house spiders, normal house spiders freak me out which is weird. And knowing that half of the tarantulas I have would rather bite me than do anything  harmful. If one bit you would likely inflict a pain comparable to that resulting from a bee or wasp sting. You would only really have issues If youaposre allergic to bee stings. They are venomous but very mild. After  years Iaposve not been bit yet, a couple of nearlyaposs but Iaposm very careful. Itaposs an obsession!

Two-year-old Hufflepuff managed to eat his way through part of the unforgiving fabric when his owner turned her back for just minutes to tend to her foster horse. The bitzer, fondly known as Cockieshitpookie, suffered severe trauma to his intestines and had to undergo a four hour surgery to remove the tablecloth. After spending  days in intensive care with specialist drugs and round the clock nursing care, Hufflepuff racked up £, in vets bills. Thankfully, his insurance covers £, - but his owner has been left with £, to try to cover through her state pension.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Owner Sue Penda opened her own animal rescue centre in Cornwall more than  years ago, where she cared for and rehomed hundreds of dogs before retiring in .Her friend, Donna Burgess said: Iaposve never known her not be doing something to help somebody. Dogs, horses or cats,they need help, shelter or treatment, sheaposs there for them. She is a responsible owner. All her animals are insured but  gave her the most awful run of poor luck. She nursed and lost three of her dogs to cancer in less than  months. With two of them going beyond their insurance cover, Sue funded their treatment from savings and selling her vehicle. Donna, from, Redruth, Cornwall, has set up a GoFundMe page to support Sue through the costs and help save Hufflepuffaposs le as he prepares for yet another surgery.  The -year-old added: Part of his duodenum couldnapost recover, so he needed another very delicate surgery to remove  inch of his gut and then a third surgery as he developed scar tissue which caused another blockage. A lot of people would have given up but not Sue. It will be years before Sue is clear of the remaining debt, using nothing but her state pension to repay the cost. I would dearly love to raise as much as possible to help towards Hufflepuffaposs vet bill and I would be deeply gratefulyou felt able to contribute. All monies will go directly to his veterinary cost. Sue and Donna have thanked their veterinary team for the awesome treatment they have provided Hufflepuff with throughout his time in their care. He thinks he is jointly owned by all the staff, who all gave much of their time, care and love free of charge,said Donna.

Mountains of donations could be seen piled inside, waiting to be organised by volunteers. One tweet from Basia Cummings said: “The Polish community of south London collecting supplies for Ukrainian refugees. “Overwhelmed with donations. Sorters needed: White Eagle Club, Balham.” Another go get involved was actor Ben Lamb who said it was “amazing” how many had turned out to support those most in need. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting posted: “Am always so proud of our community. “The White Eagle Club on Balham High Road needs more volunteers every day to assist with sorting through the generous donations.”  The venue said the most needed items include batteries, torches, clothing, shoes, nappies, dry sanitary clothes, thermal clothing, gloves, and painkillers. Other necessities are duvets, blankets, sleeping bags and pillows.It comes as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugeesupdated its estimate on the number of refugees that have left Ukraine, saying the total stands at more than , a figure that continues to rise.The UNHCR said humanitarian needs are “multiplying and spreading by the hour”. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putinaposs troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nationaposs army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous.On Sunday, February , Ukraineaposs health minister reported that at least  Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than , wounded. On Monday, February , President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said , Russian soldiers had been killed so far. He added that  Ukrainian children have been killed and  wounded over the past four days. These claims have not yet been independently veried but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed  civilian casualties in Ukraine, including  deaths, after three days of clashes, a UN report showed on Monday.It said the fighting had triggered severe humanitarian consequences and that casualties could be considerably higher.Meanwhile, UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said on Monday that at least  civilians in Ukraine have been killed since Russia launched its invasion last Thursday, with a further  injured, but the real figure is feared to be considerably higher. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, said: Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher. The agency said it is sending stock of core relief items to Moldova, including blankets, sleeping mats, family tents, winterisation kits, sleeping bags, water jerrycans, baby kits, solar lamps and other items for at least , people. “UNHCR has launched a Ukraine Emergency Appeal to help with relief efforts, because our relief work relies on donations and the needs on the ground are immense,” it said. “All donations can be made through our UK charity partner – UK for UNHCR. “We are receiving many calls from the UK public offering support and we are hugely grateful to those who have already donated or have already been in contact with us here in the UK offering to host refugees in their home.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON United Nations High Commissioner for RefugeesPublic servicesRussia Ukraine warDaily Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The trust said it is investigating a formal complaintHetty Blakey and baby Poppy Image: Hetty Blakey   BPM MediaByLauren DavidsonReporterGraeme Murray:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsA mum says she was told to terminate her pregnancy after her daughter was thought to have Downaposs Syndrome.Mum Hetty Blakey gave birthday to Poppy in November, but says she feels let down by Lincolnshire hospitals over her daughteraposs care.She also claims she was told to consider changing her address to be closer to specialist care for her. The trust has confirmed it is investigating a formal complaint and is liaising with Poppyaposs family. Along with feeling pressured into terminating her pregnancy, Hetty also claims he was told by a heart consultant that she could not see her daughter, who was at risk of heart failure. She says Poppy was given the wrong immunisations, leaving her daughter bleeding from her behind and spending time in AE.Hetty had her initial  week scan at Lincoln County Hospital. She told GrimsbyLive: From the scan, we were given a leaflet on abortion and told that it didnapost look good, and that with the amount of [nuchal translucency] fluid, there was a chance that the baby had something very severe. They handed me a scan picture and lulled me into this really depressed place of, aposThis babyaposs not going to liveapos. That was before any diagnosis was made. It was just purely off of a scan. All babies have this fluid at the back of their neck, and in a baby that doesnapost have any chromosome abnormalities, the measurement would usually be between one and two millimetres. But a baby that has a chromosome abnormality, their measurement would normally be above three. So because the thickness was so high - in our case it was .mm - that was enough for us to be handed an abortion leaflet. The couple then sought private healthcare at the Harley Street Hospital in London, and Hetty underwent CVS , a procedure which detects foetal abnormalities. It was there that she was told her unborn baby had Downaposs Syndrome.She continued: [The baby] looked perfectly healthy and they didnapost feel there was a reason to medically terminate the baby at all. Hetty said that in the first week after hearing the news, she felt like her baby was gone. She said: I had feelings of embarrassment, shame, and I thought that I was going to be laughed at.Me and my partner were really upset, but it mustaposve taken about seven days for us to snap out of it and get things organised, and just fall in love with the pregnancy again.Hetty said that she would have made the decision to terminate the pregnancy had she followed the advice given at Lincoln Hospital and not sought a second opinion. She continued: I wouldaposve aborted Poppy based on the information I was given at Lincoln Hospital. They made it feel like it was the most fair thing to do. It was not a case of, aposShe might have something wrong with her, but it could be OKapos, there was no happiness to it. It was just very much a case of, prepare yourself. I felt really hurt and disregarded. I drove on a bypass absolutely hysterical, alone, because my partner was in London that day. But I was incredibly suicidal. After that day, they never contacted me again. I was not even called to seeI was OK, she claimed. Poppy was nearly not here as a result of their advice. It was after the diagnosis that the expecting couple decided to move to Kirmington, on the outskirts of Grimsby, and their care was transferred to the Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital.Hetty also suffered with polyhydramnios, a rare condition in which there is an excessive amount of amniotic fluid. A heart defect in her unborn baby was also detected, something which occurs in around half of all Downaposs Syndrome babies - along with duodenal atresia, a condition in which the stomach is not attached to the bowel. At this point, we were classed as a very high-risk pregnancy and Grimsby could no longer deliver Poppy, Hetty said. The couple were referred to two dferent hospitals: Leeds Childrenaposs Hospital for Poppyaposs heart defect, and Sheffield Childrenaposs Hospital for Poppyaposs duodenal atresia. They were also sent to Scunthorpe General Hospital for foetal medicine. At  weeks pregnant, Hetty had to choose between giving birth at Grimsby hospital and being taken in an ambulance two-and-a-half hours away to Leeds, or move where for the remainder of her pregnancy. She said: [Going in an ambulance] ran the risk of,anything happened with Poppy, she wouldnapost have the specialist care right there, and there wouldnapost be anyone who could work on her heart immediately. So we had to basically up and move. Hetty looked online and found a hospital in London which specialises in unborn babies with Downaposs Syndrome.  She said: I was told at  weeks that the baby could come at any time, and I was told that I needed to move to London and needed to move there quick. The couple were told they had to be within walking distance of the hospital, and say they were forced to spend £, on hotels that were close by because the care Hetty and Poppy needed was not available in Lincolnshire. They eventually found an apartment across the road from St Thomasapos Hospital, where Harriett had to lay in bed for five weeks as a result of her polyhydramnios until Poppy was born. Poppy was born via emergency C-section, and Harriett said that had she not been at a hospital with specialist care available, she does not believe her daughter wouldaposve survived.  Returning home to Grimsby after Poppy underwent two surgeries, the family had been told that St Thomasapos Hospital in London would now be sharing the responsibility of Poppyaposs care with the Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital. Hetty says the care Poppy has received at Grimsby Hospital has left her feeling neglected. She said: We asked Grimsby hospitalthey could scan Poppyaposs heart as she had an open duct which couldaposve led to immediate heart failure. We were told that the consultant couldnapost see us. Hetty also claimed that Poppy was also given the wrong immunisations at Grimsbyaposs hospital. Any baby thataposs had operations on their intestines or bowels should not have something called the rotavirus immunisation. That causes sickness and diarrhoea. Poppy shouldnapost have had it, and Grimsby hospital administered it. Two days later, I was at Sheffield AE with Poppy because she was bleeding from her behind. Everything weaposd just gone through was potentially undone by Grimsby hospital, because then Sheffield were talking about a potential third surgery to correct her bowels again. For a mum whoaposs just got her baby out of the intensive care unit, it was incredibly frightening. I feel a huge amount of neglect and I feel harassed and bullied by Grimsby hospital. Iaposve had letters through the post telling me that I havenapost engaged in their services because Iaposve said to them that at the moment, as Poppy has a heart defect, the hip and ear tests they want to do arenapost important. Sheaposs seen by the top cardiologist in London and yet Grimsby hospital feel that they have to put their ten pence in all the time. Iaposm getting letters telling me how to care for my child when Iaposve been left to do this all by myself. Poppy is now awaiting open heart surgery. Hetty said: Poppy is a remarkable little girl. Melanie Sharp, deputy chief nurse at Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby said: “We are fully aware of these concerns and currently we are investigating as a formal complaint.

Some said the spaces aposhave always been annoyingapos, but others askedthe parking slots were supposed to be used sideways. PlymouthLive reports that it asked Cornwall Council about the spaces but it failed to respond. The title said: We asked Cornwall Council, but after no response we went to check out the spaces ourselves and can confirm that the width is too small to fit a car sideways too. The remainder of the car park has full-sized spaces, but they are along the wall and are are smaller than the others. Some people joked that parking wardens may give you a ticket for not staying in the lines. Another added: Does this mean you only have to pay half the parking fee  But others pointed out the smaller spaces might be used for motorbikes and smart cars. Readers of Cornwall Live were bemused by the spaces, with some offering ideas on how to fix the situation. One user wrote: “Parking charges should reflect the space occupied by a vehicle. The larger the vehicle, the higher the rate. “This would encourage people to drive smaller cars around towns to park while the aposCha tractorsapos would have to pay much more. Another said: “They probably forgot to bring a measuring tape.” Cornwall Council, says drivers can use the car park for £. per week, but this doesn’t guarantee a space - even a tiny one. It doesn’t appear to offer a discountthe motorist can only fit half their car in a space.The authority does stat, however, that motorcycles can park for free, which one poster suggested was to why the spaces are so small. And its website states the spaces should be designated. According to the British Parking Association off-street bays should be . metres wide by . metres long. It adds: These dimensions are neither minimum nor written in tablets of stone, and may be revised to suit your particular needs, but remember that good access and wider bays aids efficient use of the parking area, Some car parks are now designed with a thick coloured outline around the bays, an area to enable better access.

Michelle Hosking, , is now the subject of a gross misconduct investigation and has been temporarily dismissed from her duties as a health and safety adviser at Bournville Village Trust, where she has worked for  months. The single mum-of-two allegedly switched before colleagues, who accused her of propositioning them for sex and suddenly becoming mental and possessed.But Michelle insists she was spiked, claiming she discovered a visible pinprick and developed a huge bruise after the work do on December  in Birmingham city centre, Birmingham Live reports.After losing hours of her memory from the party, Michelle reported the spiking incident to West Midlands Police and attended hospital the following day. But three days later, the mum was suspended from her role as the Trust launched an ongoing probe and said it took the allegations of spiking and misconduct very seriously. Michelle said: I used to love working for them but the way they have treated me is horrendous. I can understand how these other girls are feeling because you donapost expect it to happen to you and when it does, no oneaposs there for you and the people that do [the injecting] donapost understand what happens behind the scenes. Iaposm a single mum Iaposve got two children, Iaposve got a mortgage to pay. If the spiking is for laughs, itaposs for laughs but itaposs not for the people that are involved in it. I keep having to ring up and ask the question to my employer and they say itaposs still under investigation. Itaposs nearly three months now and obviously the mental health impacts of that as well as everything that happened before, itaposs horrendous. Michelle can remember eating her starter and having a glass of wine before three more apostinyapos drinks. She then claims she lost four hours after she was spiked walking from the Old Joint Stock pub to the main venue, the Clayton Hotel. She said: I do believe I was spiked by injection. Unfortunately my employers have taken a very dim view of it and Iaposve been suspended on full pay ever since. I remember eating my starter then Iaposve lost four hours, she continued. I just donapost remember. The witness statements say that I was being aggressive, waving my arms around, I was possessed, I was mental, I was psychotic and I have no recollection of this at all. Itaposs almost like a switch was flicked, itaposs gone. Thereaposs nothing there at all, I have no recollection at all. They said I was acting crazy, mental, possessed. Allegedly, obviously I donapost remember any of this, allegedly I punched a colleague, I propositioned a few people for sexual relations, I was in a relationship at the time so I canapost understand why that would happen.  Michelleaposs next memory is getting home at .pm, when she rang colleagues in a confusion over what had taken place and why she was back at her house so early on into the festivities. She said: Something wasnapost quite right, I rang a couple of colleagues and said: aposWhat happened apos A couple of colleagues brought me home in a taxi. Michelle described the following months as horrendous as she claimed colleagues had been told not to speak to her, leaving her completely and utterly isolated. The last three months have been awful. I havenapost heard from my line manager since the December  when he suspended me, no duty of care was carried out. Itaposs been horrendous. I had a massive bruise on my thigh. You can see the pin prick marking my leg in the photo. On Tuesday afterwards, I went to the hospital as my sister said she didnapost like how the bruise was spreading. Michelle has hit out at the offenders using needles to spike revellers as she spoke of the impact on her mental health. She said: I donapost think people understand the actual impact that something like that can have. Iaposm just a normal mum, I take my kids to school and go to work and then this happens and your whole world implodes but people donapost understand itaposs really hard. It has really affected my mental health. I was on antidepressants for anxiety before this, so the fact that Iaposve had no communication is just exacerbating everything. The last time I spoke to them was two weeks today at the disciplinary hearing. They did actually apologise to me for not providing me with that care. I donapost know whataposs going on, no one has rang me. Bournville Village Trust said it takes both reports that a colleague has been harmed and accusations of misconduct very seriously as it said investigations take time to complete. The Trust said it could not comment on the inidual circumstances, but aposoffer support and regular contactapos through investigations. Helen Harvey, director of people and performance at Bournville Village Trust, said: “The health and safety of our colleagues is very important to us and any reports that a colleague has been harmed in any way are taken very seriously and treated sensitively. We also take accusations of misconduct extremely seriously and they are investigated thoroughly and carefully to ensure colleagues are treated with fairness and respect. This means that investigations can take time to complete whilst all evidence is gathered and reviewed. During an investigation, colleagues are offered support and regular contact throughout. As our investigation process is confidential we are unable to comment on inidual cases.” West Midlands Police said in a statement: Our investigation into this crime closed after all lines of enquiry were exhausted. If new information is received that would help us identy the person responsible, we are ready to reopen the case.

And Princess Charlotteaposs mum Kate once remarked that her only daughter is the boss of the Cambridge household. So itaposs no surprise that in the few public appearances that sheaposs made, her strong personality has really shone through.And one of those times came when she was greeting royal fans alongside her mum at Sandringham on Christmas Day .When Charlotte emerged from church at Sandringham on that day, she was presented with a beautul bunch of white roses by a well-wisher.  Royal aides are then usually passed the flowers to carry so the royal can keep their hands free and talk to other well-wishers. But it appeared that Charlotte had clearly taken a liking to the blooms and wasnapost ready to give them up. So when an aide offered to carry them, she shook her head and refused to let them go. She then clutched the flowers as she walked back to Sandringham House with the rest of the royals.

It’s that strength of character that will stand her in good stead when she’s older. And it seems that when she is older, her dad Prince William will take the throne making him King and her mum Kate Queen. And when this happens it seems that Charlotte will be in line for a unique royal title - even grander than her current one.That title is Princess Royal, which is traditionally bestowed on the eldest daughter of the monarch. The title was first introduced to mimic the French royal title of Madame Royale back in the s. The current Princess Royal is the Queen’s only daughter Princess Anne, who was given the title in .However, royal expert and author of Prince Harry :The Inside Story, Duncan Larcombe, told TownandCountrymag: “The title of Princess Royal is traditionally bestowed on the eldest daughter of the monarch.It is a title that remains for le, so Princess Charlotte will have to wait at least until the death of the current Princess Royal.

Her opinions on the Russian leader will undoubtedly have got even worse since his government launched their assault on Ukraine on Thursday.Tensions between Britain and Russia have escalated and Buckingham Palace are braced for the worst case scenario. In the event of bomb ever hitting the UK, aposOperation Candidapos would be rolled out as a possible nuclear escape which would ensure the Royal Family are safe and secure.The Queen has met Putin on a number of occasions - with their most eventful meeting coming during his state visit to the UK in . Putin is known for his bad, or perhaps intentionally tardy, timekeeping and he made the Palace nervous by keeping The Queen waiting for  minutes. Get the newsyou want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Later on, a dogaposs reaction to Putin allegedly prompted The Queen to break royal protocol and take a brutal swipe at the Russian President. According to David Blunkett, who was Home Secretary at the time, his guide dog reacted defensively towards Putin.Mr Blunkett told the BBC : The only time I met Vladimir Putin was back in  on an official visit and my then dog barked very loudly.I did apologise to the Queen who was obviously hosting. I don’t think I am giving anything away when I said, aposSorry your Majesty about the dog barking.apos She said, aposDogs have interesting instincts, don’t they apos The alleged remark would be a break from royal protocol as The Queen must usually remain strictly neutral with respect to political matters.Back in June , The Queen was seated away from Putin during a D-Day commemoration event in France. The pair gathered with world leaders at Chateau de Benouville in Normandy, which was awkwardly just months after Prince Charles was alleged to have compared Putinaposs rule to the Nazi regime. The tension was seemingly laid bare when everyone went to pose for a group photo. The Queen was helped down a set of steps by then US President Barack Obama and New Zealandaposs Governor-General Jerry Mateparae. But observes pointed out that Putin, who was stood close to them but not looking in their direction, did not bother to help the elderly monarch. In , Russia remarkably slammed the Queen for downing gin, wine and champagne every day in a aposfake newsapos propaganda blast against the UK. Senator Aleksey Pushkov, an ally of Putin, said the monarch treats drinking like a ceremony while Prime Minster Theresa May has a brandy habit.According to the Sun, Pushkov told Staterun TV: Before dinner she [Her Majesty] drinks a cocktail made from gin and another based on wine, with ice and lemon. After the meal, she has a glass of wine with a bar of chocolate. She also drinks dry Martini. At the end of the day, she likes to drink cool champagne.At the time, senior Tory MP Bernard Jenkin said the aposabsurdapos comments were aimed at undermining Britainaposs claim Russia tried to kill ex-spy Sergei Skripal and Yulia Skripal. The Queen clearly has an interest in Putin, as President Joe Biden revealed she asked him about the Russian leader in June last year. During his visit to the UK to attend the G summit in Cornwall, President Biden and his we Jill had a chat with the -year-old monarch over tea at Windsor Castle. Mr Biden said they talked about a range of topics and the Queen asked him about his relationship with Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, and Putin. This was potentially the second time that President Biden had broken royal protoclo by revealing their private conversations. The president told reporters: She wanted to know what the two leaders that I - the one Iaposm about to meet with, Mr Putin, and she wanted to know about Xi Jinping. The Queen certainly wonapost be speaking with Putin any time soon - but the Palace are making preparations for a worst case scenarioWorld War  breaks out.It is understood that Russia holds around , nuclear weapons, with the US not far behind with ,, and the Daily Star reported that plans are already in place should the very worst happen. A declassied document revealed the Queen and her close family members would either take refuge on a super yacht or be placed in a secret bunker. The document, known as Operation Candid, revealed Her Majesty and her loved ones would disperse to country houses away from London. Known residences, such as Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House, would not be used and they would be hidden in lochs in Scotland. Where there was sufficient time, the royal family would be evacuated to sea, with the Royal Yacht Britannia earmarked to keep them safe. But itaposs been  years since the plan was first devised so the current status is unknown. The royal yacht was decommissioned in , meaning another vessel would need to be used - potentially a submarine.

Putin raised the awful spectre of nuclear confrontation because he’s losing, or at least not winning as easily as he expected. His calamitous miscalculation in invading Ukraine is backfiring badly now, and the world is uniting against him. He faces a battle at home too, as anti-war protests swell in Moscow and other cities. The pressure on Putin must be intensied, never relaxed, until he has withdrawn the last of his forces from the country he attacked.  And then he must face judgement. He must be held to account for an unforgivable assault that will cost many lives on both sides, including civilians. Many more are being forced to flee their homes in terror. Britain has sent military equipment and is picking up speed on sanctions but much more can be done to help Ukraine. Oligarchs close to Putin must be pursued relentlessly.

But last year, she appeared to reveal how she really felt about former Health Secretary Matt Hancock during a meeting with Boris Johnson. Mr Hancock, who has just given an interview on the Diary of a CEO podcast, was at the time leading the UKaposs response to the Covid- pandemic.That pandemic had forced the Queen and the Prime Minister to hold their weekly meetings over the phone rather than in person for over a year.And at their first in-person audience in  months last June, a camera captured their opening remarks.  After exchanging brief pleasantries with Mr Johnson, the monarch said: “I’ve just been talking to your Secretary of State for Health, poor man…” “He came for privy council,” she said. “..he’s full of, er…” Mr Johnson interjected, to suggest Mr Hancock was full of “beans.” But the Queen appeared to say either “promises or confidence. “He thinks things are getting better,” she said.

Click here to sign up .Mr Johnson replied: “Well, er, they are.” Just days after that exchange Mr Hancock resigned after leaked CCTV showed him in a clinch with adviser Gina Coladangelo in his Whitehall office. The footage was taken on May  , when indoor social gatherings of people from dferent households were banned under law and guidance urged people to stay two metres apart and avoid face to face contact.  Mr Hancock initially clung on to his job and Mr Johnson was criticised for failing to sack him. But the following day he resigned after admitting he had broken his own Covid guidance. In a y interview with the Diary of a CEO podcast, Mr Hancock said he fell in love with Ms Coladangelo - whom he has known since his student days - while they were working together at the Department for Health and Social Care.He left his we and children to start a relationship with Ms Coladangelo, who was also married with children. The West Suffolk MP said: It all happened quite quickly, It actually happened after the rules were lted, but the guidance was still in place. So I’m not trying to claim that, I hold no bitterness about this because I broke the rules, I fess up, I broke the guidance.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Royal FamilyQueenMatthew Hancock MP\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Last Prophet in Islam.The Church of England school has since said they are “investigating” the incident after a photo of the presentation was shared on social media, Bedfordshire Live reports.Not only is the image completely incorrect, but drawings and pictures of the Prophet Muhammad are deeply offensive to Muslims. The incident has been met with outrage in the local Muslim community, who called on the school to properly explain how it could have happened.  On the school website headteacher Elizabeth Furber says she aims to “create an environment that encourages every member of our community to live well together.”One shocked person said: “Imagine how children are learning  Their minds are sponges that soak up what they’re taught!“All the teacher had to do was a description of MuhammadThere are no pictures of him, only description! They added: “If a qualied teacher is going to teach R.E then they should be well informed and educated at degree level to teach this subject properly. “How can a R.E teacher put a photo of Osamin Bin Laden  say that’s prophet Muhammad   @asadunstable Unacceptable!” The school, which teaches children aged -, has since released a y statement apologising and saying the teacher concerned has been suspended while the incident is investigated. In a statement, they said: We are fully aware of a totally inappropriate resource that was used by a teacher during an RS lesson. All Saints Academy recognises the deep hurt and distress that has been caused to the Muslim community, and many other people of faith, by the totally inappropriate images that were used as part of a recent RS lesson. “Not only was it offensive to attempt to portray an image of the prophet Muhammad, but the image that was used was that of Osama Bin Laden, a terrorist leader, which further added to the deep insult. The academy reiterates its unreserved and sincere apology for the distress this episode has caused. In terms of actions taken, we are happy to share the following information. Upon learning about this incident from a concerned student, the member of staff was immediately suspended by the principal pending a detailed and swt investigation which will follow the academy’s disciplinary procedures. “It would be against the terms of that procedure either to identy the inidual concerned or to comment any further until the final outcome is determined. Apart from investigating the actual incident, we will also commission a wider review of the circumstances surrounding the case to determine how this inidual came to act in such an inappropriate and upsetting way. For purposes of transparency, this review will be conducted by an external person who has no connection with the academy. Finally, having now established very useful links with members of the Muslim community in Luton, we would hope to work together to gain a better understanding of religious and cultural matters that impact on all our lives and will help us to be better educators. The Church of England school in Central Bedfordshire is sponsored by the Diocese of St Albans.

Kaya said: Iaposve had people asking me to shave my hair off, Iaposve had invites to peopleaposs weddings which is a bit strange. These people have never met me. There are food fetishes, where people want me to pour beans on myself, thereaposs a giant fetish where people want me to pretend that Iaposm a giant and Iaposm squashing them. So in that, I use the camera angle on the floor to make me look bigger and like use a little Lego man that they pretend is them.It doesnapost feel strange at all anymore. Nothing surprises me anymore, itaposs just normal for me now.In March , she had , subscribers and had earned £, in the year from March , Leeds Live reports.Her reach has exploded since then, as she got into TikTok to find new ways to bring in subscribers and fans, and now has almost , people signed up. While most of these are paying subscribers, in the past she said has given out free subscriptions to give back, such as to health workers during the pandemic and more recently to disabled people.  Kaya had her best performing month ever in January , when she made £, in just a month. Even a bad month, she said, means an income of around £,. Kaya said: Itaposs just going from strength to strength. Iaposm still surprising myself all the time and itaposs been four years. Iaposve been able to travel the world, which was my lelong dream. Iaposve been able to help my family, put through my sister through education, help my brother buy a house, help my parentsthey need it. Iaposve always said that Iaposll stop when the money stops but it doesnapost stop - it just gets better. When I first started people did not know what OnlyFans was. But it was the pandemic that made things soar. Now everyone knows someone who uses it. I donapost think thereaposs competition though. Thereaposs enough money out there for us all and youaposve just got to go and take it. I do want to put some more roots down now though and focus on the business.Kaya is now in the process of purchasing her own farm for her and her two dogs. She doesnapost regret leaving university though but advises others considering the same to think carefully. Kaya continued: Itaposs something youaposve really got to think about. I did it to earn extra money because I literally couldnapost afford to be at university and feed myself. I didnapost have help doing that. I had the highest loan but I still didnapost have enough money to pay for my rent. It depends on your situation. For other people, Iaposd say think carefullyyouaposre wanting to earn extra money at university. Obviously, youaposre at university because you want a certain career, while I went just to go university because everyone  was. This is perfect for me because I get to work for myself, travel the world, do all the work from my phone. Itaposs comfortable for me but once you do it thereaposs no going back. It has worried me in the past but because of how much Iaposve made now and the way I invest my money Iaposve kind of set myself up for le. Not everyone will have the same success as that though - Iaposve been here since early on and I think it wouldaposve been much harderIaposd started now.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Daniel, who regularly shares footage of his urban explorations on his YouTube channel, BeardedReality, noted that the property had been left to decay, and believes it was abandoned after the death of the former occupant.He said: The atmosphere was electrying, as soon as you enter the property you can tell that it has just been left with very little touched or moved by anyone. As you walk around the place you get the eerie sense of the personaposs le and how they lived which also gives you a slight insight into the previous occupant. The cobweb-covered kitchen still contained kitchen appliances and old chocolate tins, while old magazine samples and long-forgotten beauty products were discovered in the bathroom next door.  Another room contained PlayStation games, family photographs, a sewing machine, and a huge cross, giving further insight into the home it had once been. Cabinets filled with hundreds of books were found in the hallway, along with a suitcase, while the dusty living room still contained furniture and a piano, plus as a note left for the previous resident. Daniel continued: In the property, also dubbed by a few others that have explored it the ‘house of books’, the place contains easily over , books in ious locations, scattered in the upstairs hallways and shelves filled with them slowly collecting dust. Some of these books are very old and I noticed, in particular, a few very old encyclopaedias which were collectorsapos editions so this could fetch quite a high price.  Venturing upstairs, the adventurous pair noticed jars of miscellaneous items that had been left on the stairs before coming across an added extension, believed to be a childrenaposs room, with curtains and ious mouldering toys. On the landing, they found a typewriter, board games, and yet more books before heading into an en suite bedroom with mattresses and crumbling furniture, left behind medicines scattered all around. An upstairs study was so filled with books that Daniel remarked they couldaposve started their own book shop, while clothes still hung in a long-unused wardrobe. When taking a look at the area outside the property, the pair came across a closed-off garage, as well as an old white car, overgrown with shrubbery, which had presumably been left behind by the former owners. Daniel added: We were there for about an hour looking at the ious things here trying to paint a picture of the personaposs le and seeing all that was left behind. You feel a sense of sadness that all this is left especially personal photos and items but also a true thrill of seeing how someone once lived their le and what they left behind..Do you have an urban exploration story to share  We pay for stories.

But scientists believe they have solved the mystery, as a study revealed that the material in the dagger could have come from a meteorite. What do you think about King Tutaposs space dagger  Let us know in the comments... Researchers at the Chiba Institute of Technology published their findings in the journal of Meteoritics and Planetary Science. Daniela Comelli, the studyaposs main author, wrote: Meteoritic iron is clearly indicated by the presence of a high percentage of nickel. The paper suggests that the high levels of cobalt also strongly suggests an extraterrestrial origin. They also conducted research into meteorites known to have hit the earth around that time and found one that landed  miles from Alexandria contained similar levels of nickel and cobalt.

The report also reads: They were aware that these rare chunks of iron fell from the sky already in the th [Century] BCE, anticipating Western culture by more than two millennia. They described conducting an X-ray analysis of the golden handle, which revealed that it was created using an adhesive material known as lime plaster. But this material also wasnapost used by Egyptian craftsmen until much later. The analysis also revealed that the handle was made using a foreign low-temperature technique, that possibly originated from Mitanni, Anatolia. Records show that Tutankhamun’s grandfather Amenhotep III would receive gts from the King of Mitanni. However, experts also believe that it is possible that the Pharoah inherited the dagger from his father after it was passed down the generations. The dagger, which suggests a signicant mastery of ironworking in Tutankhamunaposs time, is on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.Do you have a story to sell  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

She opened it and found what seemed like hundreds of love letters written to a woman named Betty Sue. Anna was suitably curious and turned to the internet to track down Betty Sue, and the author of the letters - Vance. Soon she got a reply from a young man named Dalton Long, who confirmed that he knew the pair - as they were his grandparents. What do you think about Annaaposs discovery  Let us know in the comments... Anna, from Virginia, US, spoke to local news outlet WTVR-TV and said: There are no SMHs, OMGs or LOLs. It’s full sentences. Grammatically correct sentences. Isn’t that funny how that works.Anna said the hidden door wasnapost locked, but was fastened shut with a latch. When she pried it open, she found the letters inside and soon set about reading them.  One reads: Hi Honey. How is my Baby getting along  When we’re not together I know just the right words that I would use in telling you everything. But when we’re together all I can think of is ‘I love you.’ Vance. After sharing news of her discovery online, she soon had a message from Dalton Long, , who lived , miles away in Portland, Oregon.

So when one woman on TikTok told her tattoo artist that she wanted an inspirational message inked on her chest, she hoped the design was straightforward enough that nothing would go wrong - until it did. Jenner McGee, , shared a video in which she showed off her chest tattoo, which the Daily Star reports was supposed to include the outline of two butterflies alongside the phrase with pain comes strength.However, the tattoo artist made a detrimental spelling error and missed out the g in strength - writing it as strenth. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Jenner, who posts on TikTok under the username @jenner_jalene, captioned her video: Me, excited to get another tattoo.Guy spells strength, strenth. The poor woman also confessed she didnapost have a chance to correct her tattoo artist when he laid down the stencil because the cursive writing made it dficult for her to see the spelling error until the ink was finished. When someone in the comments askedshe noticed before she got the tattoo, she said: No, I didnapost see he missed the letter g in the cursive word strength. Others in the comments asked Jenner what she plans to do next, as she could either cover it up with a new tattoo or pay to have it removed. And she told them: Iaposm getting it fully removed. But one commenter was quick to point out that tattoo artists should ask clients to check every detail of the stencil before the ink is applied to eliminate the issue of spelling mistakes - and blamed Jenner for not being vigilant enough. They wrote: Every artist Iaposve ever worked with specically told me to check each detail and spelling of words and names before starting.

The Russian President and former KGB agent is understood to have been left humiliated after his goal to conquer his neighbours in  hours failed. Instead, his troops have been met with a plucky and brutal resistance, suffering their share of heavy losses on the ground despite moving in on Kyiv rapidly. The capital, as well as Kharkiv and Zhytomir, are under continued air strikes this evening as the first round of peace talks ended. The two sides met on the Belarusian border while invading forces clashed with opposing troops and civilians on a fth day of conflict. In a worrying sign, Russiaaposs defence ministry said its nuclear missile forces and Northern and Pacic fleets had been placed on enhanced combat duty. Click here to follow the Mirroraposs live blog on the Russia Ukraine conflict Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, has said this evening he has signed a request to join the European Union, urging members to fast track the country on board. It comes as Russia faces deepening isolation and economic turmoil as Western nations, united in condemnation of its assault, attempt to cripple it with an array of sanctions.Ukraineaposs allies also increased weapons transfers in support, with Finland agreeing to ship , assault rles and , anti-tank weapons. aposFalteringapos military strategy  While Ukraineaposs resistance appears stronger than first anticipated, evidence points towards the Kremlin troops continuing to overmatch their opponents, according to expert Professor John R. Deni.The research professor of joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinationalsecurity studies at the US Army War College’s Strategic Studies Institute, told Al Jazeera : “I think the evidence points to continued Russian overmatch of Ukraine in terms of both capabilities and capacity.US officials have reported that somewhere between  and  per cent of available Russian forces have been committed so far, meaning there is still lots of nearby Russian military power left to commit.”  However, the lack of progress has raised questions. Prof Deni added: In terms of the operations, there are some anomalies that do not make sense to me, including the inability of Russian forces to successfully and conclusively establish air dominance over Ukraine, the inability of Russian forces to retain control and exploit the capture of the Antonov International Airport outside Kyiv, and the evident dficulty Russian forces are experiencing in term of coordination. Nevertheless, it still remains widely accepted that itaposs a case ofrather when the Ukrainian capital falls to the Moscow onslaught. Peace talks  The two sides met on the Belarusian border today for the first round of peace talks. The content and exact position they are in, thus far, has not been made public but discussions did last for several hours, and included two breaks, according to reports. Negotiators are ing to Moscow and Kyiv, respectively, for consultations before further rounds. Russian delegation head, Vladimir Medinsky, said the two sides had “agreed to keep the negotiations going.”  It would appear Putinaposs endgame would be to either install a puppet government, with the country under his control, or potentially leave Zelensky in charge but with his powers largely stripped and Moscow absorbs Ukraine under something of a neo-Soviet regime. Putin has said his aim is to demilitarise and denazy his neighbours, suggesting he wants to neutralise them as a threat and take revenge for a largely misplaced wrongdoing. Deploy nuclear weapons  Putin has ordered Russiaaposs nuclear deterrent forces raise their alert status to the highest level. It is the first time nuclear weapons have been readied since the Yom Kippur war in  - though such devastating weapons have not actually been deployed since . Russia’s Defence Minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that the West had taken “unfriendly actions” towards Moscow. He also added Western sanctions were “illegitimate” and so Russia had put its nukes on “a special regime of duty” - though itaposs clear exactly what that means.Dr Matthew Harries senior research fellow at the defence think-tank Rusi told iNews : “Any use of a nuclear weapon by Putin would be ruinous for him. It could be Russia is planning a brutal escalation in Ukraine and this is a ‘keep out’ warning to the West. Or designed to show that Putin will not allow himself to be removed from office. He said there is a risk, however, of such threats being misjudged leading to escalation through brinkmanship. Putin warned last week on announcing the special military operations, before things quickly moved into full-scale invasion, that there would be unthinkable consequences for any nation standing in his way.  Dr Harries saidthe Russian leader interprets certain types of Western assistance to Ukraineaposs war effort as constituting direct military intervention this could trigger deliberate deployment of nuclear weaponry. “The risks of nuclear escalation from Russia’s invasion are real and should be taken seriously. This has been known from the outset and is a primary reason why the West is not intervening directly with military force, he added. Accept defeat  Putin knew when he invaded Ukraine that Russiaaposs military dwarfs that of his former Soviet colleagues. He also knew NATO wouldnapost send in troops to help, due to a fear of escalating a world war and because Ukraine is not a member state. While European dependence on Russian oil and gas means countries like Germany would think twice about imposing harsh sanctions. And so with that in mind, Putin appears to have aimed at a swt defeat of Ukraine while riding out any western sanctions. But that hasnapost been the case so far.  If figures coming out of Ukraine can be believed, he has already lost thousands of military personnel, and has failed to take any major cities or even comfortably forty the areas that have fallen to him. History has shown the idea of holding onto power and control in a defeated nation can prove far more dficult than actually successfully invading it. The Ukrainians have shown in their brave refusal to back down that installing a puppet government and trying to have his way, will not be an easy task should he win. If he gives up, without making any grounds in Ukraine, it will be a humiliating defeat.  He will likely be ostracised almost entirely by the West and his regime could be forced to collapse. Russia would have to continue dealing with the sanctions placed on it, without its prize, too. But in that regard it may be fairly well-placed to ride them out, according to one expert.Stanford University expert Kathryn Stoner told Politico Russia couldweather the already stf sanctions due to its strong independent back bone.She said: The Kremlin has built up a war chest of  billion in foreign reserves, among the most of any country in the world, has a low debt to GDP ratioand is banking on its good macroeconomic policy in the last decade to stand up, at least for a time, despite what the West may yet throw at them.

Retired UK special forces soldiers have volunteered for missions deep inside Ukraine to back up the countryaposs defence.It is believed ex-Paratroopers may at some point join the special forces teams in Ukraine, along with other UK military specialists. The veterans, aged between  and , have had meetings to discuss signing up for the dangerous mission, backing up Ukrainians in combat. Key to their operation is among them there are highly-trained snipers and experts in the use of anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates  Snipers will also help in taking out Russian forward air spotters and Moscow’s special forces who are guiding in airstrikes on troops and local communities. It is believed the operation is not being paid for by the British government but will be funded by a country in Europe, still to be named, via a private military company.The plan is a way of backing Ukraine militarily but without officially sending serving troops into battle against Vladimir Putin ’s forces.More than a dozen of the veterans have already arrived in Ukraine and another dozen will travel there this week.  Among them are warrant officers, sergeants and corporals who have fought all over the world but no Army officers have signed up yet. It follows Ukraine’s President Zelensky announcing an international call to arms for people to go to Ukraine and help defend his homeland. So far, according to official Ukrainian figures, his troops have killed , Russian troops in ferocious battles for cities throughout the country. The ex-SAS team have fought all over Afghanistan, Iraq and where globally.  One ex-SAS man told the Daily Mirror: “This has had to happen very quickly as the situation in Ukraine is now desperate and they need urgent help. “A lot of ex-parachute regiment colleagues are also very keen to go. Many people are very keen to go and it has had to be organised very quickly. “It is legal as none of the men going out are still serving and Ukraine has invited people to go in and help the fight militarily. “It means some of the most experienced veterans in the world will assist Ukraine and link up with Ukraine’s force headquarters. “And we do know that Putin has a great deal of respect of the SAS.”  Sources confirmed all of the SAS veterans heading for Ukraine are experts in the use of Javelin and Stinger missiles. President Zelensky appealed to people to help his country take up arms on social media. He said: The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is addressing all citizens of the world, friends of Ukraine, peace and democracy. “Anyone who wants to join the defence of Ukraine, Europe and the world can come.” Today it emerged The French Foreign Legion has given the go-ahead for its Ukrainian members toto their homeland to help defend it - along with their full battle kit.A squadron of serving SAS troops is in Poland already, helping to train Ukrainian troops in how to launch sabotage missions in an insurgency against Russia.Their aim is to teach Ukrainians how to form secret resistance units to undermine an occupying force and even assassinate collaborators and Moscow sympathisers.The British Ministry of Defence has already said no British troops will be in Ukraine to fight as this would mean Russia confronting a NATO member state directly. It is believed serving SAS teams are in the Baltic States, with one team on standby to support a joint US -UK operation to evacuate President Zelensky by helicopter. SAS soldiers have been pre-positioned across the Baltic States to support Nato partners and poised to react to any incident inside Ukraine that UK politicians decide needs urgent military intervention. Operating with an American Joint Special Operations Group the British troops are ready to airlt President Zelenskyhe asks for help and react to any other ‘humanitarian emergency’ - that may be approved by Downing Street. It comes as the UK delivers hi-tech air defence weapons to the Ukrainian military in a move to help them down Russian helicopter gunships attacking Zelensky frontline forces.  NATO countries are coordinating a massive resupply of weapons, ammunition and medical supplies to Ukraine which are being shipped in from outside Ukraine by local troops. One missile, called Starstreak is a shoulder-launched air defence weapon - designed to target helicopters and fighter aircraft. The lethal weapon which is feared by helicopter pilots can strike at ranges up to three and a half miles, locking onto aircraft and firing tungsten darts that rip through the fuselage. The delivery of thousands more missiles comes as Ukrainians say UK-supplied NLAW anti-tank weapons have been smashing Russian tanks. So far a staggering  Russian tanks have been wiped out, according to Ukrainian official figures, many of them by NLAWs.  Russia has lost  warplanes since the invasion started,  anti-personnel vehicles,  trucks and  fuel tankers, losses which have badly damaged the Russian onslaught. The package of weapons includes thousands of grenades, claymore anti-personnel devices, heavy machine guns,  mm light anti-tank weapons, high-velocity sniper rles. Britain along-with other Nato forces is also providing ‘remote military advice’ to help Ukrainian commanders direct their tactics to counter Putin’s overwhelming forces with intelligence guidance. A senior source said the Russians have a huge force of helicopters in Belarus, as well as the East which are being used to target the Ukrainians before the ground force arrives. He said : “If Zelensky presses the ‘get me’ button the SAS and US team will fly in and evacuate him. “The hope is that the Russians would agree to an air corridor for the airlt, but who knows. “In the meantime Putin’s people have overwhelming control of the skies and the Ukrainians need air defence weapons and more anti-tank weapons”.

In Jordan five years ago British ex-Paras trained up Syrian Defence Force troops to battle Islamic State in a secretive mission to pit better skilled troops against the terror group. The project went on in secret camps just over the border and was funded via a private military company to avoid the government paying for it directly.  Ukraine’s call to arms from foreigners was backed up by Ukraineaposs foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba.He said: Together we defeated Hitler, and we will defeat Putin too.British foreign secretary Liz Truss backed Brits who wanted to go to Ukraine to go. aposI do support that,apos she said.The people of Ukraine are fighting for freedom and democracy not just for Ukraine - for all of Europe.

They are Oleg Deripaska, once Russia ’s richest man but now under US sanctions, and Mikhail Fridman, worth £.bn and named by the US treasury in  as linked to Putin.The Ukraine-born Fridman and his partners own Alfa-Bank, Russia’s largest privately held bank, as well as supermarket chain X, the country’s largest, and mobile carrier Veon. The US and EU put Alfa-Bank under sanctions that restrict its ability to raise debt financing on international markets but do not go as far as the measures used to block major state lenders such as VTB from the global financial system. Both Deripaska and Fridman own properties worth tens of millions of pounds in London. Deripaska tweeted on Sunday, “Peace is the priority. Negotiations must start ASAP”, while Ukrainian-born Fridman called for an end to the “bloodshed”.Pressure is growing on other Russian billionaires to follow suit, including six worth £bn who have valuable assets in the UK.They include Cha FC owner Roman Abramovich, worth more than £bn, and Alisher Usmanov, worth more than £bn. Neither Abramovich nor Usmanov have currently faced any UK or US sanctions, while Deripaska is not currently under any UK sanctions.Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates Abramovichaposs spokesperson said on Monday that he had been asked by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution and that he has been trying to help ever since. They added: “Considering what is at stake, we would ask for your understanding as to why we have not commented on neither the situation as such nor his involvement.” Abramovich famously owns Cha and a London property portfolio reportedly worth £m alone. Most of his wealth comes from £.bn steel giant Evraz, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange.He owns two superyachts, according to the website SuperYachtFan, the m Eclipse, worth an estimated £m and last spotted in Sint Maarten in the Caribbean, and m-long Solaris, worth £m, which was yesterday docked in Barcelona.Formerly a major Arsenal shareholder but now linked to Everton, Usmanov splits his time between two UK mansions worth more than £m, in London and Surrey. His m superyacht Dilbar, worth £m, was last spotted in Hamburg nearly two months ago. He is yet to publicly comment on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The wealth of Russia’s oligarchs are under threat with the country’s economy in crisis and sanctions affecting their businesses. Several, including Suleiman Kerimov and Andrei Guriev, were among business leaders summoned to a meeting with Putin at Kremlin last week. Neither has publicly commented on the war.  Kerimov, worth £.bn, has been sanctioned by the US since  - but is not under any UK sanctions. In , companies linked to his family transferred m to Vladimir Chernukhin, husband of a major Tory party donor.Lawyers for the Chernukhins insisted that “none of the money donated to the Conservative party by Mrs Chernukhin came, or was in any way derived from, Mr Kerimov”.Kerimov’s son Said owns a string of Polyus companies based in the UK. Kerimov owns m superyacht Ice, currently in Genoa, Italy. Guriev, worth £.bn, a fertiliser tycoon, reportedly owns Witanhurst, London’s largest private home, second in size only to Buckingham Palace and worth a reported £m. Since he was named on a  US list of Russian oligarchs close to Putin, his fertiliser business Phosagro, which is listed on the London stock exchange, has paid out more than £m in idends. Guriev is not under any UK sanctions currently. The Guriev family owns nearly % of the shares in the company. Guriev’s £m superyacht called Alfa Nero was last spotted in the Bahamas. Other oligarchs with physical assets in the UK include ex-KGB officer Vladimir Yakunin, the former head of the Russian railways who was sanctioned by the US in  over the annexation of Crimea. His family have strong ties to London. One son Andrei owns a villa in Highgate, north London, bought for £.m in  through a Panamanian company. He successfully applied for British citizenship. Together with a second London property, they have been estimated as worth almost £m. Yakunin is not known to be faced with any sanctions in the UK. A second son Victor runs an investment firm based in London. Igor Shuvalov, chairman of the state development corporation VEB.RF is a powerful figure in Russia and a hardline Putin loyalist who has been named as owning two luxury London apartments bought through a Russian company for £.m. It was claimed he used his secret private jet to fly his we’s Corgi dogs around Europe - including to Britain - for competitions because first class is ‘too uncomfortable’ for them. Shuvalov said last year: “If a Russian feels any foreign pressure, he will never give up his leader. Never.” On February , the EU added three people not sanctioned in the UK to its sanctioned list, including Igor Shuvalov. The other two iniduals were Vladimir Soloviev, a Russian television presenter, and Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the Russia Today television news network.  Oleg Deripaska, once Russia’s richest man, is now worth just £.bn and was sanctioned by the US in . Deripaska launched a failed legal bid to overturn the sanctions. He allegedly tried to donate to the Conservative Party in the early s and hired former Tory minister Lord Barker to chair his En+ Group in . Deripaska reportedly owns  luxury properties around the world including three in the UK. Hamstone House, in Surrey, formerly the favourite home of the Duchess of Windsor, is currently on the market for £m. Deripaska owns it through one of his offshore companies, along with a £m Belgravia townhouse and a third property the Mirror has identied close to St James’ Palace. Deripaska’s m superyacht Clio, worth £m according to SuperYachtFan, was last seen in Sri Lanka, while a smaller vessel, the £m Elden, is in the Black Sea.  Mikhail Fridman, worth £.bn, was named by the US treasury in  as linked to Putin. But he has strong ties to Britain after buying Athlone House in North London for £million in . In a letter to his employees, Fridman wrote: “I am a businessman with responsibilities to my many thousands of employees in Russia and Ukraine. “I am convinced however that war can never be the answer. This crisis will cost lives and damage two nations who have been brothers for hundreds of years. While a solution seems frighteningly far off, I can only join those whose fervent desire is for the bloodshed to end.” It was reported on Monday that the EU is proposing new sanctions on a string of oligarchs. Bill Browder, hedge fund manager and former investor in Russia, now a political activist, told the Mirror: “I believe that the main missing piece of the sanctions program is going after the oligarchs. If we really want to give Putin a black eye, these people need to be sanctioned.” The UK Governmentaposs website only names six companies and five iniduals with new sanctions against them. The Mirror approached all companies and organisations linked to iniduals mentioned in the above article for comment.

The militia have been ordered to decapitate Zelensky’s government infor a handsome financial bonus.The scheme is part of Vladimir Putinaposs plan to try and seize Kiev, knockout the government and conquer Ukraine within  hours - a plan that has so far failed.The Ukrainian government got wind of the mission on Saturday morning, reports The Times, and mere hours later Kyiv declared a -hour aposhardapos curfew to sweep the city of saboteurs. Follow all the updates on our live blog Civilians were warned they risked being aposliquidatedaposthey stepped outside. The Times reports that a source close to The Wagner Group, which is run by one of Putinaposs closest friends, said between , and , mercenaries are operating across the whole Ukraine with the  in the capital having slid into Kyiv via Belarus.It is hoped that peace talks, set to get underway today, may begin to de-escalate the war although there are also fears Belarus could soon send troops into Ukraine, backing their long-time ally Russia. But it is not known how serious Russia are about the talks or what their demands will be five days after invading Ukraine following weeks of troop build up along the border. The Wagner Group mercenaries are in contact with the Kremlin are awaiting a signal before unleashing bloodshed on the streets, The Times says, with a hitlist that contains Zelensky and  other figures including the prime minister, the cabinet, the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir, both popular former boxing champions. After Moscow invaded last week, Zelensky addressed the nation, claiming that Russian special forces were in the capital searching for him as “target No ”.  However when he was offered the chance to flee by America he said: “I need ammunition, not a ride.” Boris Johnson has said Britain will do all it can to get more arms to the beleaguered Ukrainian military as Russian forces continue to threaten Kyiv.The Prime Minister spoke again on Sunday evening to President Zelensky who told him the next  hours would a crucial period for his country. Russian and Ukrainian forces have again been engaged in heavy fighting ahead of the widely expected assault on the capital. Earlier, Mr Johnson dismissed a dramatic announcement by Vladimir Putin that he was putting Russiaaposs nuclear forces on heightened alert as a distraction from the failure of his troops to breakthrough in Ukraine.President Putin sent shock waves through Western capitals with his instruction on Sunday to his top military leaders to put the strategic nuclear deterrent on a special regime of combat duty. The US said it was completely unacceptable while a senior US defence official was quoted as warning the Russian leader had made any miscalculation ... much, much more dangerous.

That means we must throw open our doors to Ukrainian refugeesVladimir Putin has chosen the path of war Image: Getty ImagesopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments Today we salute the bravery of the Ukrainian people as they struggle to repel the biggest invasion of their country since .Their sacrices in the name of freedom are heartbreaking, humbling, but inspiring. And it is the duty of every civilised nation to do all we can to help them.The air raid sirens wailing over Kyiv  years ago warned against Nazi attacks, not Russian ones. ButVladimir Putin objects to being compared with brutal dictator Adolf Hitler, he has only himself to blame. Like Hitler, Putin’s word cannot be trusted. Like Hitler, he promised peace while all the while being intent on war.Like Hitler, Putin cares nothing forindependence and liberty as he attempts to recreate an empire.And like Hitler, he plans to subjugate a sovereign nation with all the force and brutality at his disposal. Just as we faced down Hitler, we must face up to another dictator determined to destroy the freedoms we hold so dear. And we must do it without sleepwalking into a Third World War.  Boris Johnson compared this invasion with that of Czechoslovakia in . This time there must be no appeasement. That occupation set off a chain of events that took six years of horrying war and  million deaths to resolve. Ukraine must regain its rightful independence sooner than that but, nevertheless, we must be prepared to be in this for the long haul. Now that Putin has chosen the path of war, he has to win it, and we dread to imagine the horrors that might unleash.  That means we must throw open our doors to Ukrainian refugees who appeal to us for a safe haven and might even want to stay here. We are told such a resettlement programme is being prepared. But, as always in Whitehall, the wheels are moving despairingly slowly. Ireland has waived the need for visas for Ukrainians. The Irish will get them to safety first and worry about the paperwork later. We should follow that example. Now it is incumbent on the rest of the world to isolate Russia as the pariah state it is. Even Putin’s traditional ally, China, has shown a certain ambivalence to the tyrant’s actions.  It abstained on the UN resolution to condemn Putin for the invasion – a promising result rather than a great one. President Xi of China is the one man who might persuade Putin to withdraw and he should make every effort do so. Meanwhile, the rest of the world must put a stranghold of sanctions around the Russian state. And NATO must stand firm and resolute.  The borders of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland are the NATO red line. Putin must be left under no illusion about the lethal consequences of crossing it. Andthe Russian people are as truly opposed to this war as they appear to be, there is only one course of action open to them: to topple the man who caused it.

But by the time I was on the case, the disease was spreading closer to home # in forests near Loch Carron, Ross and Cromarty.Phytophthora, ominously meaning #plant destroyer#, is a genus of fungus-like organisms containing around  known species with a worldwide distribution.The genus, which includes the pathogens that cause potato blight and sudden oak death, has been responsible for massive crop failures, economic loss and environmental damage.Phytophthora are called #fungus-like# since they behave like fungi but dfer from them, and from all animals and plants, in several key features of their reproduction and chemical makeup.This places them in an ill-defined group of misfits called protists, which also includes amoebae, kelp and slime moulds.Phytophthora pluvialis was discovered in Oregon USA in , where it resides in soil and watercourses, and mainly infects Douglas fir.Its recognition in Cornwall during  was the first identication of this particular Phytophthora species in Europe.Thought to have arrived here on imported live plants, its spores germinate in water and can be spread, for instance, on shoes, tyres and animal paws.The pathogen infects a iety of trees, including western hemlock, Douglas fir and several pine species, causing needle shedding, shoot dieback and lesions on the branches, trunks and roots of infected trees.Forestry and Land Scotland and its policy section Scottish Forestry took rapid action # surveillance to detect infected forests, restrictions on the movement of timber and trees, and asking the public to report suspicious tree lesions.But since the European climate is ideal for P pluvialis to thrive, and its favoured trees are commonly grown here, like so many other plant pathogens, it seems likely that this one is here to stay for the long term.Forestry and Land Scotland asks foresters and the public to be vigilant for signs of Phytophthora pluvialis.Anyone who thinks they might have spotted signs of the disease should report it using the online TreeAlert system on the on www.forestresearch.gov.uk website."},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry loop sportive announced","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe popular Kilberry Loop Sportive will take place on Saturday August  this year.Organised by Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle Club and local man John Hardie, the -mile open road event starts and finishes in Tarbert.Registered as an event with British Cycling, the fun, friendly Kilberry Loop Sportive is targeted at every level of cyclist.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

route through the park but the rest of the park is in a great deal of darkness.“The lighting in the park is really appalling.”Tricia Hill, Scottish Borders Council estates surveyor, told the meeting that officers in the parks and lighting teams would not recommend installing lights in either location due to there being alternative lit routes.Ms Hill added that it has been estimated that placing bollards in Victoria Park would cost £,, with further costs of £, and £, for energy maintenance and light source replacement.For lanterns it would set the council back £,, £, and £, under those same categories, according to Ms Hill.At Tweed Green, bollards would cost around £, to install, with £, estimated for both energy maintenance and light source replacement fees.Lanterns would again be cheaper on all three fronts at £,, £, and £,, Ms Hill told members of the sub-committee.Councillors agreed that there needs to be a balance between making sure routes are safe at night and avoiding

to @ScotParlon #coronavirus.Watch live ➡️ https:t.co zWDxpMyAefrom :pm. pic LKTccbDIm— Scottish GovernmentFebruary , What did Nicola Sturgeon say today Free PCR testing to continue in ScotlandNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the healthbudget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”.remove: Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rulesNew Covid Strategic FrameworkThis weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”Covid isolation to continuePeople who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination updateVaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform websitefor more information.Vaccine Passport SchemeThe First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .Face covering restrictions to end on March The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transportwill end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Latest Covid casesToday, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegvpic WCZTIZVjw— Scottish GovernmentFebruary , The First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-.more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-announces-mystery-scottish-gig---get-tickets","story":"Gigs in Scotland has today released the newsthat Calvin Harris will be coming to Scotland.The musician will be coming to Scotland in summer , but as of yet the location has been kept secret.Those interested in attending can sign up for an exclusive pre-sale on the Ticketmaster website.Harris has not given any hint to the performance on his own social media.The show is part of a number of gigs he will be performing this year, including  exclusive shows in Ibiza.,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"\" fill\"#\"View this post on InstagramtranslateY\"translateX translateYwidth: .pxflex-grow: margin-right: pxmargin-left: px\"translateY\"translateY rotate\"\"\"translateX\"A post shared by Gigs in Scotland The DJ and producer will also be ing to Creamfields this summer.

greater employment opportunities and rising population levels.I am appealing to people throughout the region to support my Right to Food Bill proposal before the consultation closes on Wednesday February .In the wake of Ofgem#s eyewatering increase in the energy price cap last week, which will see already struggling households having to wrestle between paying for heating or paying for food, the Right to Food has never been more needed.If the SNP and the Greens hadn#t played party politics and kicked my Bill back, we could have already been working on ensuring the Right to Food is enshrined in Scots law.Instead, we are having to re-consult at a time when the country is already grappling with a cost of living crisis.On Thursday, Ofgem announced that from April the energy price cap would rise  per cent to £, – that is an extra £ households will have to find just to keep their homes warm and the lights on.Forthcoming increases to the interest rate and rises in National Insurance payments will exacerbate the situation.It is heart-breaking. I have had food bank helpers in tears saying we can#t wait another year for the Right to Food to kick in. People need help now.Food bank volunteers need assurance that the invaluable support they provide in their communities will end one day, when wages and benefits are adequate enough for proud families to be able to stop using the food banks.New statistics show rising homelessness across Scotland. Food bank use is soaring. Illnesses of the past like rickets and malnutrition have reappeared.In a rich nation like Scotland, in the st century, this is appalling. It#s Dickensian.People are struggling right now – it#s time the First Minister stops commentating on the cost of living crisis and starts doing something about it.She could start by allowing her MSPs to support my proposal."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week february 11 2022","story":"Mum Lizzie, who sent in the photograph, said: #The butterfly was a lovely surprise spotted by Hannah Molly in the woods on our way up to find a trig point on Tirfergus Hill.#If you have a photograph you would like to share, please email it to editor@campbeltowncourier or get in touch via the Courier#s Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week february 11 2022","story":"I was excited to see Seville oranges in the grocers.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up. They will also provide your lettuce seedlings with protection from birds and slugs.Good ieties to start now include cut-and-come again Salad Bowl – oak leaved, high yield with green and red ieties a cos such as Lobjoits Green – dense, crisp heads with self folding leaves or the small butterhead Tom Thumb – perfect for growing in small spaces, it matures early and has a mild taste.Prepare for spring by carrying out basic maintenance.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, this month there are signs of the approaching spring, with bulbs appearing and wildle waking up as light levels and temperatures increase.There#s plenty to do indoors this month to prepare for the season ahead.Outdoors, as the garden comes to le, it#s time to prune shrubs and climbers, such as wisteria, as well as evergreen hedges."},{"url":null,"title":"driver woes derail oban golfer bobs title bid","story":"The honorary Machrihanish Golf Club member finished tied in ninth place at the Ras al Khaimah Classic on the final leg of the DP World Tour#s Desert Swing, building on his solid performance over the same course the previous week.After carding an almost flawless opening round of  on Thursday, Robert suffered a cruel piece of bad luck before his Friday round after the face of his driver cracked during his warm up on the practise range.Speaking after carding a  on Saturday, following his  on Friday, Robert said he struggled with his replacement driver.#Unfortunately, my driver cracked on Friday morning and I#ve not got the perfect replacement but no-one does,# said the left-hander.#Off the tee, I#m trying to find my golf ball.

describes the proposals to axe music tuition as #catastrophic# and urged the council to re-consider.He wrote: #I feel it would be disastrous for the area to lose this essential musical training, not only to the local people whose lives are enriched by music, but also for the tourism on which so much of the local economy depends.#Campbeltown and the surrounding district is famed throughout the world for its traditional music and it would be very unwise even to consider implementing measures which would effectively bring this reputation to an end.#He added: #I am lending my strongest support

The mine was finally rediscovered by HMS Bicester early last week.Bad weather made it impossible for the crew of the Bicester to attach a surface riser to it and the mine was left to a Navy ing team to bring it up.Led by Lt Adrian Dann, the four-man Northern Diving Team from Faslane finally pinpointed the mine on Tuesday morning and brought it up later that day.The two-tonne mine is currently lying on the New Quay waiting to be picked up by the mine laying team from Cromby, Fe.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown churchgoers, in common with other congregations throughout the country, are being asked to sign petition forms calling for an end to public filth in television and literature.Already many people, including non-churchgoers, have appended their names to the forms which are also in several businesses in the town.The forms are headed: ‘Petition for public decency.’It states: ‘Being concerned about the effect on society – particularly on the young – and of the increasing exploitation of sex, the public portrayal of intimate or unnatural sexual behaviour and violence and brutality, we the undersigned call upon Her Majesty’s government: to note the concern of the public about this matter. to ensure that the law as regards of sanity stops this public affront and is so designed as to be an effective instrument for the maintenance of public decency.Some church congregations in the town have already begun signing the petition and others planned to follow suit in the near future.All of Campbeltown’s ministers are in agreement that the obscenities on television and in literature are going too far, and hope that the petition has the desired effect.The Reverend James W Hood, of Lorne Street Church, commented yesterday: ‘I think it is perfectly right that the church should be given the opportunity of speaking its mind.’SEVENTY YEARS AGOThe majesty and pomp of King George VI#s funeral procession through London, and later its journey to Windsor Castle, was seen and heard by people in Campbeltown and Tarbert on Friday, in the history-making experimental television broadcast.In both places, reception was remarkably clear and those who were privileged to see it saw this royal journey of dignied and poignant pageantry in a much greater detail than the vast crowds in London and Windsor.At both places, the sets, with -inch screens, were shown by radio dealers to parties of friends.Mr Anthony P MacGrory, Campbeltown town councillor and housing convener, had his set installed in the radio showroom of his firm’s shop in Main Street.At Tarbert, the set there was arranged by Mr Douglas C Smith, Electrical and Radio Engineer, Harbour Street.Earlier last month, Mr Smith informed us that he was getting surprisingly good results from the test from the Scottish television station at Kirk o’ Shotts – the Scottish station which is using only low power transmission.Scottish TV reception of this historical occasion was the previous day viewed with serious misgivings and doubts by BBC experts, who pointed out that the Kirk o’ Shotts station was not due to open until March  and that this is the first-ever television radio link up, connecting Scotland to London, through Manchester, was merely an experiment and the Scottish transmitters were still undergoing adjustment.So, until the TV programme went onto the air on Saturday, the BBC could give no guarantee that the venture would be successful.It was a great success and thousands of Scots over a wide area, from Dumfries to Aberdeen, saw clear pictures of the funeral processions.At Campbeltown and Tarbert, the pictures were almost as clear as everyone was looking at them on the cinema screen, the detail in some of the pictures being unbelievably perfect.One local businessman, who saw it, described it as ‘uncanny’.But, throughout the years, this has been the descriptive of all great inventions when they first made their impact on the public mind.It was a pity, of course, that this great moment in Scottish television progress should have been heralded in with such a sad event as the funeral of our King.Considering that Kintyre was not regarded as a good reception area and that this  miles relay was the longest ever attempted by the BBC, the result was truly amazing and will no doubt mean the booking of many orders from this part of the country.Already, Mr McGrory has been receiving enquiries from ious parts of Argyll.We were privileged to see the screening in Mr MacGrory’s premises that afternoon. The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television network, it must have been an unforgettable experience to have this outstanding London ceremonial brought hundreds of miles to before their eyes and to be taken in imagination straight to Windsor to watch the Royal coffin being carried out and upon it the Imperial State Crown, the orb and the sceptre and the white wreath of orchids, camellias and lilies of the valley from Her Majesty, the Queen Mother, also movingly clear."},{"url":null,"title":"leader february 25 2022","story":"This week#s publication of the report on the follow-up visit to Campbeltown Grammar School makes welcome

buildings, they do not meet the needs of ACHA’s current or future tenants for a iety of reasons around layout and energy efficiency.ACHA is committed,demolition is permitted, to build  high-quality family homes, built sensitively in this outstanding seafront location.In reference to the gap sites at Saddell Street and Queen Street, ACHA does plan to bring these sites back in to community use and will consult on that in the very near future.That will be consistent with what we did when we demolished properties in central Campbeltown and replaced them with  family homes at New Parliament Place, Park Square, Longrow and McCallum Street.ACHA is committed as a partner of Argyll and Bute Council to do all we can to complete the direction of travel of regeneration in central Campbeltown over the

a note of our increase in the state pension from April  .The increase is . per cent whilst, by that time, inflation is expected to be in excess of . per cent.Therefore, this published increase is actually a decrease in real terms of . per cent.This is, of course, due to the triple lock guarantee being abolished by Rishi Sunak.I was pleased, however, to be informed that upon reaching my th birthday in December this year,I am still here, I can look forward to a further increase in my state pension of  pence per week.Any suggestions as to what I should spend this welcome amount on Never mind, when the SNP and Greens obtain independence, they will be able to increase my pension from their abundant resources.Then again, all the SNP’s money trees have been blown down in the recent

Trezise said it would be the first time he had performed on Arran since staging a school show on the island more than  years ago.He also has fond memories as a child coming to Arran from Cupar in Fe

What#s inside the singing kettle # # which Artie still uses today.While this principle was always central to the action, plot lines and stage sets were built around imaginative story lines, transforming the original concept into a spectacular musical for the whole family.The Singing Kettle turned children’s theatre into an art form and the troupe#s unique performances became the bench mark for fellow professionals everywhere.They performed in hundreds of venues, from the Palladium in London to the Town Hall in Campbeltown, from the Palace Theatre in Kilmarnock to the Royal Palace in Jordan.BAFTA-award winning and decorated with MBEs for services to children’s entertainment, audiences worldwide were hooked on their madcap musical adventures flavoured with cheeky Scottish humour.Adults and children alike found themselves singing the songs together long after the performances were over.The company closed in , with the final line-up forming Fun Box and with Cilla retiring.Artie continued performing solo shows as Artie#s Tartan Tales but since the beginning of  his show is now Artie#s Singing Kettle.There is a £ one price ticket for the show, plus booking fee.

But over these last years, I have also written stories inspired by my observations and experience of le and people. It’s been a mixed bag in terms of theme and topic.Recently, at a talk to a local group, one of the members came up to me and said: “I’ve read your column for years now, with my tea and biscuits on Thursday mornings. I’m never sure what to expect, but that’s what’s kept me intrigued, it’s a bit like a lucky dip.”The most interesting stories for me are those of people I meet, and this column has given me the privilege of getting to know folk I would probably never have met otherwise. Some have become good friends, but I’d like to take this opportunity to say thank you to all those who have been in contact, shared their stories and time, shown me places or given me comments. I’ve said it before and will say it again: the ability to write every week and connect with people is a huge privilege I am very thankful for.Telling a story on Traprain Law I feel very lucky as I’m now able to give talks and have the joys of storytelling in schools and where. We have all yearned for ato ‘normality’ but of course so much has changed and what’s normal for one person isn’t for another. I know that many people can’t, or feel unable to, enjoy the relaxation of measures. I’m acutely aware of the dference in people’s experiences and circumstances our stories are dferent and the impact of the last two years will be felt for many years to come.It’s light now, the sky outside is grey and the bare branches of the nearby trees are dancing in the wind. The birds are searching for the seeds I left out for them in our small garden, and it’s almost time to wake the children to get them ready for school. In moments like this, I try to pause and soak in the magic of le. It’s not always easy to do so like most folk, I have my bag of worries, anxieties and problems, and sometimes the day ahead, with all its responsibilities, can shadow my mood.But watching the morning arrive, even on a cold, blustery February day, is a gt. Our days are our lives, and we need to pause and think about how we spend each one of them. I have learnt the importance of this as I’ve got older of letting my soul catch up with me, putting things into perspective by opening that bag of worries and seeing them for what they often are: less important than they have made me believe.Storytelling at Cuthill a few years ago So with your patience, and I hope your company, at least every now and then, I plan to continue to write this column, perhaps not for another  years, but at least for a while yet as circumstances allow. I still have new places to explore in East Lothian, a list of people to meet who have kindly agreed to share their stories, and our county is blessed with a rich heritage of history to discover.And as I always say when I do a storytelling session, I am not the only storyteller in the room, for we are all storytellers. This is The Year of Stories, a time to celebrate the stories which have made us who we are, as an inidual, as a community, as a nation.But I think it must also be a time to celebrate and indulge in the art of traditional storytelling itself, that powerful personal connection made with a telling of a tale between teller and listener heart to heart, eye to eye, mind to mind. In this age of TikTok, which is redefining attention as a -second soundbite, then the need to scroll on, I think the ancient craft of the traditional storyteller, is needed more than ever.I hear folks say: “He’s a storyteller, so he would say that!” But of course, “I’m not the only storyteller in the room” you are a storyteller too. We all have stories and tales worth sharing. And the more we share, the more we may understand each other.So I look forward to hearing and perhaps sharing more tales in the weeks, and possibly years, ahead. Perhaps your story, your tales too "},{"url":null,"title":"hygiene-ratings-every-greggs-east-lothian","story":"We have five branches nearby meaning we are never far from a steak bake or a vegan sausage roll.But with each store, there comes a dferent standard to cleanliness and hygiene. And thanks to the Food Standards Agency  we get to look at what each of the hygiene ratings is for the dferent locations. Inside a Greggs shop.

said: “The modular buildings in use as a bakery are used as an additional food preparation facility and kitchen for the existing, established Drt cafe business which is located some  metres to the west of the site.“It is a popular tourism and leisure business and, due to its success, increased food preparation facilities are required.”And they said that the new units could lead to additional jobs being created.They added that an accompanying statement from the applicant had said that the additional bakery space at the farm would “secure existing employment and require three to four new full-time equivalent positions based at the farm\".Additionally, planning officers ruled that the Ez-Riders start-up business fitted in to the tourism and leisure uses appropriate to the countryside and supported the Castleton Farm business.They said: “The use of the container units for Ez-Riders fits a farm ersication project whilst generating new tourism visitor-related business employment

address Boris Johnsons Living with Covid policy and the scrapping of all Coronavirus restrictions in England as of Thursday.This week, Nicola Sturgeon announced her Covid strategic framework also known as a roadmap out of Coronavirus restrictions.Heres what Ms Sturgeon said during her Covid briefing today.Today First Minister @NicolaSturgeon will give an update to @ScotParl on #coronavirus.Watch live ➡️ https:t.co zWDxpMyAe from :pm. pic LKTccbDImNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the health budget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”                                                                                                              : Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rules                                                                                                              This weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”People who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform website for more information.The First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transport will end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Today, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegv pic WCZTIZVjwThe First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-. more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-announces-mystery-scottish-gig---get-tickets","story":"The musician will be coming to Scotland in summer , but as of yet the location has been kept secret.Those interested in attending can sign up for an exclusive pre-sale on the Ticketmaster website.Harris has not given any hint to the performance on his own social media.The show is part of a number of gigs he will be performing this year, including  exclusive shows in Ibiza.class\"instagram-media\"data-instgrm-captioneddata-instgrm-permalink\"https:www.instagram p CaT_TVTsE_  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"data-instgrm-version\"\"style\"background: #fffborder: border-radius: pxbox-shadow:   px  rgba,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"href\"https:www.instagram p CaT_TVTsE_  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"style\"background: #ffffffline-height: padding:  text-align: centertext-decoration: nonewidth: %\"target\"_blank\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: %flex-grow: height: pxmargin-right: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: flexflex-direction: columnflex-grow: justy-content: center\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxmargin-bottom: pxwidth: px\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: block height: px margin:  auto px width: px\"width\"px\"\"px\"viewBox\"   \"version\".\"xmlns\"https:www.w.org  svg\"xmlns:xlink\"https:www.w.org  xlink\"\" fill\"#\"d\"M.,.

Sure enough , as we catch up with everyone’s favourite back street razor gang turned criminal big shots, the worst has happened to Tommyand the rest of the family. Aunt Pol, played in glorious fashion by Helen McCrory, is no more.It was not a change anyone wanted to make, but in real le, a place crueller than any fiction, McCrory died last year.

This stems from the  Harbours Act which states that any harbour may be open to all for the shipping of goods.“But in my view is this is so very dferent. Can you imagine Churchill complying with Victorian legislation and allowing a vessel owned by a hostile nation into the Flow “We have a proud maritime history in Orkney, and we should play our part and issue an immediate ban on all Russian vessels entering our harbours. This would be a peaceful but very effective act.”Councillor Sankey intends to liaise with OIC officers, his councillor colleagues and politicians early next week to see how this visit can be stopped. He says he can’t condone OIC services of any type assisting the vessel.“Whilst we may by law have to allow access, there’s no law that says our pilot boats and tugs should be used, and I’m deeply unhappy about our harbour assets helping a Russian ship under current circumstances,” adds Councillor Sankey.In a statement provided to The Orcadian on Saturday, Orkney Islands Council said the authority is an “extremely dficult position.”A spokeswoman said: ”We recognise the strength of feeling around this — feelings that we share —  but we are bound by our legal obligations to accept the vessel, until such a time as the UK Government tells us otherwise.“We have sought urgent advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who have told us that the current sanctions do not cover this operation.”We continue dialogue both with elected representatives and Government departments on this situation as we seek to clary what possible further action can be taken.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Its past policies of political neutrality have failed the test of time, and today must mark a turning point for how sport engages with society, how it stands for democracy and human rights.“A new approach, consistently applied, that rests on sport’s proclaimed values is urgently needed.”Earlier on Monday, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Ireland and the Irish FA joined the English and Welsh FAs in refusing to face Russia in an international fixture at any level.The Scottish FA send a message of support, friendship and unity to the people of Ukraine. pic hSckZTsXz— Scottish FAFebruary , The SFA and FAI also offered their support to the Ukrainian federation with regard to the organisation of matches scheduled against the team later this year.Scotland are due to host Ukraine in a World Cup play-off semi-final in March and then in the Nations League in June, with an away fixture set for September.The Republic are due to play Ukraine twice in the Nations League in June, first at Dublin’s Aviva Stadium and then at a neutral venue unless current UEFA guidance changes.Formula One’s governing body was due to hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss the future of Russian driver Nikita Mazepin.The Automobile Federation of Ukraine president Leonid Kostyuchenko has demanded the FIA bans all Russian and Belarusian drivers from competing outside of their own countries.Ukrainian tennis star Elina Svitolina heaped pressure on the sport’s governing bodies to remove Russian and Belarusian athletes from competition. vw,vw,px, px\"Elina Svitolina is Ukraine’s leading female tennis player .“We, Ukrainian players, requested to ATP, WTA and ITF to follow the recommendations of the IOC to accept Russian or Belarusian nationals only as neutral athletes, without displaying any national symbols, colours, flags or anthems,” Svitolina posted on Instagram.“Accordingly I want to announce that I will not play tomorrow in Monterrey, nor any other match against Russian or Belarusian tennis players until our organisations take this necessary decision.“I do not blame any of the Russian athletes. They are not responsible for the invasion of our motherland.“Moreover, I wish to play tribute to all the players, especially Russians and Belarusians, who bravely stated their position against the war.

Players today play for the statistics, but this is the biggest mistake they can do.“Statistics are just a bit of information that we have, but there are players that make the team play good and are not in the statistics.“Players say, ‘How many goalsI score or how many assists’… this is the problem.“These statistics never existed before.

In a statement in the chamber, the Minister said the scheme injected at least pound.m into the economy, leading to an improved level of consumer confidence and increased levels of public spending. Today, the Department published a set of management information on the Scheme covering: number of residents issued with a cardnumber and percentage of cards activatedtotal spendnumber of transactions and spend by Local Government District andlocation and spend by postcode.The Minister said: “The High Street Scheme has been a huge success and achieved exactly what it set out to do. It brought shoppers back on to the High Street and has helped and supported our local retail, hospitality and service sectors start their journey of recovery from the devastating impact of the pandemic. “I am really pleased to announce that ,, people were issued with a Spend Local card, of which ,, – or .% – were activated. This is a tremendous achievement. The scheme was designed to provide an economic boost to the local economy and to this end pound.million has been injected into the economy. “This can be clearly seen from the fact that nearly .million customers visited our local shops, restaurants, bars, cafeacutes, cinemas, hairdressers across all parts of Northern Ireland during the letime of the Scheme and over .million new transactions were made using the Spend Local card. “Of course, we know that many of these customers will have spent more than the pound on their Spend Local card. So the figure – in real terms – will be greater.” The Minister told the Assembly that the early analysis showed the benefits of the Scheme were enjoyed in all parts of Northern Ireland. He said: “Over poundmillion was spent in Belfast, over poundmillion in Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon while over poundmillion was spent in each of the following local council areas – Newry, Mourne and Down Derry and Strabane Antrim and Newtownabbey Lisburn and Castlereagh and Ards and North Down. In Mid and East Antrim, the figure was over poundmillion. In Causeway Coast and Glens and in Mid Ulster, more than poundmillion was spent, while the figure for Fermanagh and Omagh was just over pound.million.” MLAs heard how the scale of the task of delivering the High Street Scheme was unprecedented as, in a matter of weeks, his Department implemented a process which manufactured, dispatched and delivered cards to close to .million people – each card unique to each applicant, including bespoke embossed cards for the visually impaired and blind. The Minister told MLAs: “The effort was worth it. I am sure that Members will have heard the same positive messages that I have heard from businesses, but it has also been confirmed by independent analysis.” According to an Ulster Bank Survey, retail sales in Northern Ireland rose in November  for the first time in four months. The banks Chief Economist Richard Ramsey said the High Street Scheme undoubtedly contributed to the pick-up in demand. Research in December  also showed an increase in shoppers on Northern Ireland’s high streets. The figures published by the Northern Ireland Retail Consortiumshowed a boost to the number of people going into shops or businesses in October continuing in November following the introduction of the High Street Scheme. In November, the number of shoppers in Northern Ireland reached their highest point so far compared to the pre-pandemic level. The Minister said: “The people from which I was most pleased to hear were the business owners who needed the scheme to help them cope with the impact of the pandemic. On a personal level, these iniduals – shopkeepers, barbers, newsagents, publicans, cafeacute owners, the list goes on – brought it home to me why this scheme was so important.”"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast ready for 11 days of celebrations to mark st","story":"A live concert and carnival pageant among the top attractions plannedExpand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDressed up: A reveller enjoying himself on a recent St Patrick’s Day in Belfast“ FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDressed up: A reveller enjoying himself on a recent St Patrick’s Day in Belfast“Claire McNeillyTwitterEmailFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSt Patrick’s Day is back in Belfast — only bigger and better after a two-year hiatus.Indeed, the reimagined event will comprise  days of citywide celebration from March -.A live concert on March , a St Patrick’s Day carnival pageant and a traditional music trail will be among the top attractions.Belfast Lord Mayor Councillor Kate Nicholl said she’s thrilled to host the celebrations after two years of the event not taking place due to the pandemic.“It’s great to have the input of community organisations too to help make this a city-wide celebration that will appeal to a wide range of people, young and old, from all corners of our city, with plenty of free activities happening day and night across the  days,” she said.“As a UNESCO City of Music, music will play a major role this year with a Féile Trad Trail running from March  and a St Patrick’s Eve concert at Custom House Square.“The concert promises to be a real family-friendly affair this year featuring authentic homegrown talent.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “And, on St Patrick’s Day itself, I’m excited to be leading Beat Carnival’s pageant parade and am really looking forward to seeing the city come alive with colour and performances.”Read MoreWhen is Pancake Tuesday  in Northern Ireland and what is the meaning behind it Leaving on a high note: Ulster Orchestra launches search for new chief executiveShow at Lyric Theatre cut short after cast complain about behaviour of audienceCreative development funding was given by Belfast City Council to four organisations to deliver a new-look celebration that is fun and welcoming.A free family-friendly concert will take place on Wednesday March  at Custom House Square between -pm, delivered by The Duncairn Centre, supported by the Arts Council NI.The concert will feature some of the island’s brightest voices with music from popular duo Mick Flannery and Susan O’Neill, rising-star Tolü Makay and experimental folk artist Joshua Burnside.There will also be special performances from trailblazing flute and whistle player Brian Finnegan and The Duncairn Creative Collective, which brings together over  independent Irish musicians from dferent backgrounds and genres.Barry O’Kane from The Duncairn Centre said it’s “a dream come true” to perform in the city.“We look forward to representing the authentic, modern and erse society we live in, while providing an inclusive and family-friendly atmosphere where all shades of Irishness, and none, are welcome,” he said.This year’s new-look St Patrick’s Day parade by Beat Carnival will be a colourful pageant of costume, music, dance, circus and theatrical performance.David Boyd, director of Beat Carnival, said the new parade “will be a spectacle of creativity, fun and challenge proclaiming that ‘we are all Patrick’”.Feile an Phobail will also be delivering a series of events as part of this year’s St Patrick’s Day programme of activity.Its director Kevin Gamble said they would be “bringing an array of music sessions, gigs, illuminations and workshops” over  days across the city.Events include a Féile Trad Trail — which will see popular bars, restaurants, hotels and visitor spots throughout the Gaeltacht Quarter and city centre celebrate traditional Irish music.St George’s Market will also host daily traditional music performances at the market from March -.Tickets for the St Patrick’s Eve concert are free and available via www.visitbelfast from am on March .

I actually thought that the amendment when I first saw it was an early April Fool’s joke.Amendment one passed on an oral vote but it was disputed by Alliance MLA Andrew Muir who believed it was not handled appropriately.Amendment  was defeated more comprehensively.Ahead of the debate, Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey commented on the publication of the latestIPCC report.She said: “The IPCC has issued its most serious warning yet about the current and future effects of climate breakdown. Climate breakdown is not just a crisis of the future, but an ongoing crisis which is currently devastating lives across the world.“The IPCC has said we are facing ‘an atlas of human suffering’. But despite all the scientic evidence, Minister Poots has brought forward amendments to weaken Northern Ireland’s proposed climate laws.“The Minister has proposed a less ambitious target for methane – a greenhouse gas over  times more potent than carbon dioxide.“This is in direct contradiction to the UK Government’s Climate Change Committee, which has advised that methane emissions must be signicantly reduced, and that no sources of emissions can qualy for special treatment.“The Minister is also asking for a complete exemption for agriculture from our net-zero target. Agriculture is Northern Ireland’s biggest emitting sector, accounting for more than a quarter of our emissions. To completely ignore and discount agricultural emissions would be both reckless and irresponsible.“We will not get out of this crisis by pretending it’s not there. The time for denial and delay is over. It’s time for MLAs to step up and ensure strong net-zero climate legislation is passed.”A total of  amendments have been brought for the further consideration stage of Edwin Poots# bill.Northern Ireland is the only part of these islands to not yet have climate change legislation in place.Related topicsDepartment of Agriculture, Environment  Rural Affairs - Edwin PootsMore On \" class\"-as:\"Department of Agriculture, Environment  Rural Affairs - Bid to outlaw fracking in Northern Ireland welcomed by environmental campaigners PremiumLegal challenge to plans for gas storage caverns beneath Larne LoughStaffing crisis in agri-food industry is down to immigration rules, Poots told PremiumThe Weekly Political Spin: From delayed apologies and Poots# preference for steak, to Thatcher and Cromwell PremiumFreight traffic rises at NI ports as Irish truckers find rules easierMost ReadContent warning: #Show this to Putin#, six-year-old’s final moments following Russian shelling of MariupolLisburn luxury property oozing modern style includes home gymI will always love you: Laura Stalford’s poignant message to her late husband ChristopherFlashy Northern Ireland crime couple raised kids in house full of drugsSam McBrideOpinionEven while humanity grieves, those toxic trolls just have to keep on tweetingTop VideosPlayChristopher Stalford: Politicians gather for funeral of DUP MLA PlayUkrainian Ambassador compares Putin to Hitler in passionate speechPlayMother of murdered schoolgirl Jenner Cardy pens book about dealing with her daughter#s murderLatest Northern IrelandFate of tanker in Belfast uncertain after ports told Russian vessels not welcomeSome flipping fantastic recipes for Shrove TuesdayAllison MorrisOpinionJeffrey Donaldson can’t stay hidden forever… he has an election campaign to front upFour people charged in connection with death of woman and car crashUkraine war must be considered in NI’s climate change laws, MLAs toldLatestNetflix has ‘no plans’ to host channels required by Russian lawGovernment wins Commons battle to reinstate protest limits despite Tory concernsPM says Putin will ‘feel the consequences’ for Ukraine invasion as he heads eastDisney pauses film releases in Russia in response to Ukraine crisis‘I’m realising this is the new reality’: How le in Ukraine has changed,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Harland  Wolff TwitterAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe fate of a huge oil tanker in a Belfast shipyard is uncertain after the Government said UK ports should refuse access to Russian boats.The Eduard Toll docked at Harland  Wolff’s shipyard earlier this month — where it is currently being worked on — before the invasion of Ukraine.The mammoth liquefied natural gastanker is the largest to enter the shipyard in recent years, and dwarfs Harland  Wolff’s most famous vessel, the ill-fated Titanic.It is designed to operate year-round from Russia’s Yamal peninsula and to break ice up to .m thick. Harland  Wolff on Monday night said it will “continue to support the UK Government’s position”, following Transport Secretary Grant Schapps’ call for all UK ports to deny access to Russian flagged, registered or operated vessels.Mr Shapps tweeted on Monday: “Given Putin’s action in Ukraine I’ve made clear these vessels are NOT welcome here with prohibiting legislation to follow.”In a letter to UK ports, he said the maritime sector “must play our part” in sanctioning Russia over Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Russia’s assault on Ukraine is an unprovoked, premeditated attack against a sovereign democratic state. The UK Government has been clear there would be massive consequences and a severe cost for any Russian military incursion into Ukraine, and, in co-ordination with our international allies and partners, we are developing an unprecedented package of further sanctions,” he said.“The maritime sector is fundamental to international trade and we must play our part in restricting Russia’s economic interests and holding the Russian government to account.“In these circumstances the Department for Transport does not consider it appropriate for Russian vessels to continue to enter UK ports.“From this point onwards, UK ports are asked not to provide access to any ship which they have reason to believe is: owned, controlled, chartered, or operated by any person connected with Russia owned, controlled, chartered or operated by designated persons flying the Russian flag registered in Russia.“We will seek to support UK ports in identying Russian ships within scope of the above and will communicate directly with relevant ports when we identy ships bound for UK ports who fall within scope of the above.“Further detailed sanctions against Russian shipping are being developed and further details will be shared very shortly.”Harland  Wolff said in a statement to the Belfast : “We are aware of a request issued by the Department for Transport instructing UK ports not to provide access to any ship which is owned or controlled by any person connected with Russia, flying the Russian flag or registered in Russia.“Harland  Wolff has a long tradition of working with UK Government and will continue to support the UK Government’s position.”It is unclear whether the UK Government’s request only concerns incoming Russian vessels, or also those already docked or undergoing repairs.It is also unclear whether or not the Eduard Toll — which measures up at a signicant draught of .m and aof m — we be allowed to leave the Belfast dock amid the current climate.Harland  Wolff’s Belfast shipyard is the site of one of Europe’s largest heavy engineering facilities with deep-water access, and also two of Europe’s largest dry docks. The famous shipyard was saved from closure back in  after being acquired by UK-based energy company Infrastrata. Following the acquisition of Harland  Wolffin August , the firm has focused on opportunities in both ship repair and shipbuilding.Related topicsUkraineMore On Ukraine PremiumSam McBrideOpinionUkraine crisis: Nuclear conflict with Russia is too terrible to contemplate, but during Cold War we planned for ArmageddonSchoolgirl, Polina, shot dead by Russian troops among at least  children killed in Ukraine invasionDigging deep: Donations across Northern Ireland flood in for Ukraine refugees‘Our prayers are with the people of Ukraine’: Royal Moscow Ballet’s performance of Swan Lake cancelled in LondonderryNorthern Ireland will not play Russia ‘for the foreseeable future’ as Irish FA joins boycott before Fa and Uefa announce banMost ReadContent warning: #Show this to Putin#, six-year-old’s final moments following Russian shelling of MariupolLisburn luxury property oozing modern style includes home gymI will always love you: Laura Stalford’s poignant message to her late husband ChristopherFlashy Northern Ireland crime couple raised kids in house full of drugsSam McBrideOpinionEven while humanity grieves, those toxic trolls just have to keep on tweetingLatest Northern IrelandSome flipping fantastic recipes for Shrove TuesdayAllison MorrisOpinionJeffrey Donaldson can’t stay hidden forever… he has an election campaign to front upFour people charged in connection with death of woman and car crashUkraine war must be considered in NI’s climate change laws, MLAs toldDraft Budget could lead to ‘lasting damage to the justice system’LatestNetflix has ‘no plans’ to host channels required by Russian lawGovernment wins Commons battle to reinstate protest limits despite Tory concernsPM says Putin will ‘feel the consequences’ for Ukraine invasion as he heads eastDisney pauses film releases in Russia in response to Ukraine crisis‘I’m realising this is the new reality’: How le in Ukraine has changed,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Chris IsonAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailIt comes but once a year, but today is a calendar highlight for those fond of the odd treat: Shrove Tuesday.The Christian tradition dictates that Shrove Tuesday is always held the day before Ash Wednesday, or the first day of Lent, so it ies from year to year.As Easter is normally a time for fasting, the day was seen as a last chance to use up remaining ‘indulgences’, like milk and sugar.The name ‘Shrove’ Tuesday comes from the word shrive, which means absolution. It is documented that Shrove Tuesday has been celebrated in some form or fashion as far back as around , AD.In recent years ‘Pancake Tuesday’ is celebrated around the world and recipes have become more adventurous and ied, while healthy options have also gained in popularity. At the end of the day, it’s up to you what toppings and little extras tickle your fancy.The Belfastcaught up with Northern Ireland chef and healthy food enthusiast Jen Curran to get the scoop on some delicious pancake recipes for this year’s Shrove Tuesday.First up we have banana ‘Notella’ pancakes. This recipe will make seven pancakes — so it’s up to you as to how many people that will serve!Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Looking at ingredients, for the pancakes themselves you’ll need: g of gluten-free oats one teaspoon of baking powder one teaspoon of vanilla extract one tablespoon of chia seeds one cup of milk of your choiceoil to cook with and two bananas to top.For the ‘Notella’ to spread on top, you’ll need: g of roasted hazelnuts one tablespoon of melted coconut oil two tablespoons of cacao or cocoa powder two tablespoons of maple syrup and five tablespoons of boiling water .Now down to the cooking. For the ‘Notella’ spread, blitz your hazelnuts in a blender until they start to resemble nut butter, and then add in all other ingredients. If you want your spread thinner, add more water. When finished, store at room temperature.For the pancakes, mix your oats with the baking powder and chia seeds in a blender until they resemble a flour — the finer it is the better, the pancakes will hold together. Next add this to a bowl and gradually pour in one cup of milk of your choice, whisking as you go. Once all the milk is in, add the vanilla extract.Get a good non-stick pan out and add one tablespoon of coconut oil, before adding in your pancake mix. Using a quarter cup measure will give you seven pancakes.Cook the pancakes on a medium heat for a few minutes each side. If the batter gets thicker as it sets, you can add a splash of milk. Finish off with your spread and bananas and you’re good to go.Next up we have Jen’s ‘choco hazelnut stack’.You’ll need: g of roasted hazelnuts g of gluten free oats one tablespoon of chia seeds three tablespoons of cacao powder one teaspoon of baking powder two tablespoons of maple syrup a punch of salt and one and three-quarter cups of milk .For the cooking, mix your oats, g of hazelnuts, chia seeds and salt and baking powder in a blender until they resemble a flour. Once again, the finer it is the better you pancakes will hold together. Next add this to a bowl and pour in the milk gradually, whisking as you go, and once all the milk is in add the maple syrup. Roughly chop remaining g hazelnuts and also add into the batter.Now add one teaspoon of coconut oil to a non-stick pan and cook on a medium heat for a few minutes on each side. Using a quarter cup measure, this will give you seven pancakes.You can also top with banana, yoghurt, nut butter, berries or whatever tickles your taste buds.Jen said: “I think what people really want is tasty food but,you can squeeze some extra nutrients in there, why not! As long as you don’t compromise on taste and your still enjoying the meal it doesn’t hurt that it’s also good for you.“For me food should be a pleasurable experience first and foremost and Pancake Tuesday is a day to have fun. No need to take it seriously. We’ve all after flipped a bad pancake or two — myself included.”Most ReadContent warning: #Show this to Putin#, six-year-old’s final moments following Russian shelling of MariupolLisburn luxury property oozing modern style includes home gymI will always love you: Laura Stalford’s poignant message to her late husband ChristopherFlashy Northern Ireland crime couple raised kids in house full of drugsSam McBrideOpinionEven while humanity grieves, those toxic trolls just have to keep on tweetingTop VideosPlayChristopher Stalford: Politicians gather for funeral of DUP MLA PlayUkrainian Ambassador compares Putin to Hitler in passionate speechPlayMother of murdered schoolgirl Jenner Cardy pens book about dealing with her daughter#s murderLatest Northern IrelandFate of tanker in Belfast uncertain after ports told Russian vessels not welcomeAllison MorrisOpinionJeffrey Donaldson can’t stay hidden forever… he has an election campaign to front upFour people charged in connection with death of woman and car crashUkraine war must be considered in NI’s climate change laws, MLAs toldDraft Budget could lead to ‘lasting damage to the justice system’LatestRussia pressed to halt attack on Ukraine at rare UN sessionsNetflix has ‘no plans’ to host channels required by Russian lawGovernment wins Commons battle to reinstate protest limits despite Tory concernsPM says Putin will ‘feel the consequences’ for Ukraine invasion as he heads eastDisney pauses film releases in Russia in response to Ukraine crisis,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Bangor were able to stop the Hinch drag flick from the top of the circle.With Bangor on the front foot and looking to increase their lead they applied the pressure on lsquoHinch.

This was a warning sign of things to come as just moments later McCoubrey managed to put the ball into the net courtesy of the outside of his right boot after a scramble in the box.Again, Carryduff showed their resilience and still relied on their counterattacks, the latest coming from captain Conway, although his misjudged pass denied team-mate David Quigley a chance at goal.The pressure would continue to mount on the Carryduff back line and soon it was - as McCoubrey registered his second of the match mdash albeit through an unorthodox but neat finish.Celtic defender Blaine Connolly saw his effort fantastically thwarted by Carryduff lsquokeeper Leggett, who pounced to the bottom right corner of his net with a strong outstretched arm to deny further punishment.The weather began to give its input into the game as temperatures ped bitterly and the wind began to blow harshly at intervals.Although this cannot be cited as the determining factor in this contest by any stretch of the imagination, it certainly played its part when Carryduffrsquos Emmet Curran saw his through ball carried beyond its intended target.Carryduff did manufacture a rare breakaway and it looked asstriker Jonathan Wilkinson would open the away sidersquos account when a pass from midfield left him with just lsquokeeper Curran to beat.However, an impressive last-ditch tackle from defender Gary Carberry allowed the Celtic number five to hook the ball to safety, thus further frustrating the opposition.Celticrsquos Shaun Megahey saw his left-footed effort saved before Carryduffrsquos Joseph McBrien swept up the loose ball and in the last notable action of the half, Conway witnessed his lowly struck effort palmed away from danger by the Hoopsrsquo number one.As the second half kicked off, the home side showed no signs of relenting as they pushed for more goals.Conaill Kerr saw his point-blank effort superbly saved from six yards by lsquokeeper Leggett, who, despite the score line, made numerous contributions to prevent his side conceding into double figures.This over-eagerness from the hosts would cost them as they were caught short at the back, leaving Raymond Grant unmarked  yards from goal.The striker quickly picked his spot and unleashed a lovely curled effort into the top right hand corner to get his side off the mark.Unfortunately for Carryduff, this was as good as it got as Celtic replied almost immediately with McMahon grabbing his second of the matchafter rounding the lsquokeeper for an easy tap in.Things went from bad to worse for the away team when Stephen Galbraith slipped a pass into the path of team-mate Conaill Kerr, who made no mistake with his finish in the one-on-one scenario.At this point Carryduff were aiming for damage limitation but Celtic smelt blood. McMahon completed his hat-trick with an eye-catching acrobatic effort before McCoubrey, tapped in his third of the day.Hoops defender Carberry picked up a yellow card after some unsavoury words with the official and captain Michael Rice was left red-faced after midfielder Curran knocked the ball between his legs, but the home outfit didnrsquot let that deter them from their onslaught.Carberry atoned for his booking in the form of a late header from a Galbraith corner delivery to round off the scoring at -.After the match, hat-trick hero Sean McMahon gave his thoughts on his sidersquos resounding victory.ldquoIt was a good performance, he said. ldquoWe knew they only had  players so we had a good chance of winning but you have to play the  minutes and make sure you get the victory at the end of the day.ldquoWersquove put pressure on the league leaders, itrsquos good to score three goals but the main thing is to get the three points.He added: ldquoI donrsquot usually score headers so thatrsquos my pick of the goals for me.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, B Connolly, R Fitzpatrick, G Carberry, M Rice , B Treacy, C McCartan, S McMahon, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.

Caolan Murray had two great chances to win it in stoppage time, but both went begging.Mooney was denied what seemed a certain goal by a brilliant intervention by Meathrsquos Padraqic Harman, whose outstretched arm clipped the ball away just as Mooney was about to shoot to the net.Just a few moments later Mooney mdash and Down mdash suffered further agony when his fisted attempt came back off the crossbar.Even so, Down can considerate themselves fortunate to come away with a point after they failed to score during a second half when they found themselves defending desperately against a Meath side driven on by their fans and a gale force wind.The conditions were horrendous and it was a tribute to both sides that they managed to produce an entertaining game of football mdash in the first half at least.Down had the advantage of the wind in the first half and led by - to - at the break, half of their tally coming from Pat Havern who hit -.Meath must have fancied their chances as they turned around with the wind in their backs, but they couldnrsquot adapt to the terrible conditions and Down held out, surely much to the satisfaction of their manager.The home side took an early lead in the match with a free from their goalkeeper, Harry Hogan.Havern responded for Down  seconds later, but when another free opportunity presented itself for Meath three minutes later Hogan again converted to make it - to -.Successive points from Havern, who used the wind well to execute the scores, edged Down in front for the first time, but in the th minute a brilliant move involving Thomas OrsquoReilly and Jordan Morris ended with Clarke finishing brilliantly to the net for Meathrsquos opening goal.The madcap nature of the contest continued when a rare mistake by Donal Keogan gted Down possession and they took full advantage with Anthony Doherty, Havern and Jack McCartan combining to set up Andrew Gilmore for a fine goal.Gilmore stretched Downrsquos lead with a point from a mark, but again Meath knitted together an excellent move against the wind with Scully playing a neat one-two with Matt Costello before firing to the net to make it - to -.Seconds later OrsquoReilly rattled the crossbar and Jason Scully was wide from the follow-up.

The Gill brothers, Gareth and Kyle, were among the replacements.Ballynahinch used the conditions superbly to burst into a lead they would not surrender.Playing with the wind, they pinned the students back with excellent tactical kicking and after missing an early long range penalty they went for the corner following a UCC offence at the breakdown and Kyle McCall burst from the edge of the maul to score.A great kick and chase moments later led to another penalty and another maul try for McCall. Greg Hutleyrsquos superb conversion took Ballynahinch  points clear after  minutes.The second quarter yielded only a single UCC penalty. Ballynahinch were not quite as accurate as they had been earlier in the game and small errors and indiscipline allowed UCC plenty of possession. However, excellent defence and long clearing kicks meant that the Ballynahinch line was never threatened.The second half was a scrappy affair and Ballynahinch began to fall foul of the referee at the breakdown.UCC kicked a long range penalty to close the gap to six points and missed another moments later as Ballynahinch struggled to put phases together into the wind. However, they sprung to le on  minutes and battled upfield where McCall was denied another maul try for a double movement.Following this disappointment UCC won a big scrum penalty and had the chance to kick to the corner to really turn the screw but misjudged the wind and kicked the ball dead. From the resulting scrum it was the away side who were celebrating as they won a penalty to relieve the pressure and settle the nerves.As the game entered the final quarter it was an error-strewn, stop-start affair, with injury stoppages and errors denying either side the chance to stamp any authority on proceedings.A mistimed Ryan Wilson tackle earned him a yellow card on  minutes and when UCC kicked the resulting penalty to close the gap to three points UCC were probably favourites.However, Ballynahinch produced an excellent spell of forward play with their maul continuing to be a very powerful weapon.They won a penalty from a maul on halfway and went for the corner, using up vital time on the sinbin and subjecting UCC to huge pressure deep in their .A solid scrum allowed Rory Butler the chance to go for the line where UCC gave away a penalty at the breakdown. Ballynahinch piled on the pressure, carrying hard at the line and desperate UCC defence led to another penalty and a yellow card for their replacement prop.The game was now there for the taking and following another big scrum on the UCC line Ballynahinch tried to put Conor Rankin over on the blind side.Multiple phases later UCC looked to have weathered the storm when they stole the ball and kicked clear. A superb chase saw Ballynahinch caught in possession but Cairns made an excellent arcing run to scythe through the cover and head for the line.He was tackled just short but the supporting Hutley was on hand to barge over, taking a knock in the process.He recovered to slot the conversion, sending Ballynahinch  points clear going intothe last five minutes and they saw out the game in relative comfort.Celebrations lasted long into the night and Ballynahinch have now put daylight between themselves and UCC.Third from bottom UCD arrive at Ballymacarn Park on Saturday to take on a rejuvenated local outfit who now have a snf of avoiding the relegation play-off.

One sat down while the other went up to the counter and asked for a bag of coins to be changed.As the men waited in the bank a Securicor delivery van arrived and a guard began leaving money bags into the bank.As the guard left a second bag into the bank one of the robbers produced a handgun and pushed him to the floor while the other vaulted the bank counter and grabbed the bags.Both men then left the bank and raced down the alleyway beside Irwinrsquos Superfoods to the red Sierra which was waiting, with a driver, at the entrance to the supermarket car park.The car sped off and was found on Sunday abandoned in a cul-de-sac off Hillfoot Crescent.CASTLEWELLAN ndash Mill bosses this week denied they plan to close the doors on a Castlewellan factory ndash less than three years after the plant was reopened.Speculation has intensied that Castlewellan Yarns, which is based in the former Moss Lane factory on the townrsquos Dublin road, is to be shut.The company is a ision of Linfield Group of textile-companies but a spokesman when asked about possible closure said this week: ldquoThat is not the situation at the moment. The Castlewellan plant was set up to do a specic job. It is having to compete head-on in a dficult world market at this time of depression.ldquoThere has been short-time working and we have operated at  per cent of capacity. Castlewellan is totally dependent on an upturn in the general linen market.The Linfield Group announced in  that it intended to commence production in Castlewellan. It said then it hoped to create up to  jobs in a poundm investment. However, employment levels have failed to reach this mark and the Ulster linen trade generally is currently experiencing one of it biggest slumps for a number of years.ARDGLASS ndash An assurance has been given that the long-awaited improvement package for Ardglass harbour will go ahead, despite a sizeable increase in cost projections.The chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Authority, Mr Ronan Fitzsimons, has said he is confident the work on the scheme will proceed, even though it is expected to cost substantially more than the Governmentrsquos pound.m budget.Work on the project, which involves extending the main pier by  metres and providing rock armouring at the back of the harbour wall, was expected to begin next month.But trawlermen, who have been campaigning more than  years for the scheme, were startled when it emerged late last week that tenders received were vastly above original estimations.It has been claimed that some of the tenders are up to pound, over the initial budget.Mr Fitzsimons said yesterday there would be a delay in the start date but denied rumours that the scheme is being put on ice indefinitely.ldquoThe start will have to be put back but there is no question of the project being ped, he remarked.STRANGFORD ndash The proposal to build a tidal barrage across Strangford Lough has been killed off ldquoonce and for all.Stormont Minister Richard Needham axed the plan because of the damage such a barrage would have caused to the sensitive environment of Strangford Lough.The announcement has been welcomed by environmentalists who described the Ministerrsquos attitude to the Lough as ldquovery positive and encouraging.Mr Needham made his announcement at the annual conference of the Royal Society for the Protection of birds and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy in Newcastle on Saturday.Opening the conference in the Slieve Donard Hotel, Mr Needham said the barrage proposal would no longer be merely shelved but would be dropped completely.ldquoIn the early rsquos there was a proposal to construct a barrage across the Narrows to allow the generation of electricity using tidal power, explained Mr Needham. ldquoAt that time, the proposal was examined from many viewpoints. On economic grounds it just did not measure up, and so it was shelved.ldquoThere is no doubt that the creation of a barrage would severely and irretrievably damaged the superb wildle of the Lough, altering the tidal regime, ruining feeding grounds, and in the process reducing muchthe scenic quality, said the Minister.KILLYLEAGH ndash A government minister is to be asked by Down councillors tomorrow to lt the embargo on marina development at Killyleagh.A deputation of councillors is hoping to persuade Economy Minister, Mr Richard Needham, to allow a marina development on the shores of Strangford Lough.The Minister will be told of the fears that Killyleagh is being turned into a ghost town because of substantial job losses in its industrial base ndash and the belief that a marina could hold out hope of a revival.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor. Mr Sam Osbourne, said ldquowhile we are meeting the Minister about the decision last August to refuse three separate applications for a marina, it goes much wider than that. There is a need for an overall plan for this town.ldquoThe whole place is badly run down and has probably never been at a lower ebb. Killyleagh is a ghost town now.

Improved disabled access is also part of the investment plan which will result in a number of paths being widened.Council officials say the planned improvements are essential for local people who are increasingly using the trails as part of their daily routine and commute.Since the start of the Covid pandemic, there has been a major increase in the number of people walking along the banks of the Quoile with this set to increase over the spring and summer.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason and Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Gareth Sharvin are delighted with the master plan and the benefit that it will provide for the town, its residents and visitors.Cllr Mason said due to Covid- restrictions, many areas across the district have experienced an increased use of outdoor spaces.ldquoThis has been so important for the health and wellbeing of residents and visitors to our area, she continued.ldquoThe Quoile in particular has been extremely busy with families and friends using the location for running, walking, cycling or simply meeting up with each other. The need for good quality outdoor space has never been as important.Cllr Hanlon said she was ldquoexcited to see the first phase of the local authorityrsquos Covid recovery scheme being rolled out.ldquoI am pleased the work will include enhancing boardwalks and paths at Jane Shore with improved disability access in particular at the gates which will be of particular interest to local anglers who have lobbied for better access, she said.ldquoThis work is vital in enhancing the tourist and heritage offerings we have locally and create better linkages to the town centre.Cllr Sharvin said the joint local authority and government department investment will signicantly improve access along the Janes Shore area and help disabled anglers in particular who have highlighted with him the challenges they face of accessing the walkway.ldquoThe planned improvements will enable everyone to enjoy the uniqueness of the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset, he said.Cllr Sharvin said work to resurface the footpath, replace wooden fencing and walking boards, in tandem with the provision of new accessibility gates and cutting back trees and hedging will make a major dference.He said the foliage will be cut back next month and when that is completed, it is hoped that work on the other planned improvements will get underway.The Quoile Angling Club is holding its annual meeting in Murphyrsquos bar, Downpatrick, on March  at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Preservation order put on hold pending planning application  ","story":"A DECISION to make a preservation order to protect trees at the centre of the Exploris Ropebridge car park project in Portaferry has been put on hold.The Department of Infrastructureconfirmed this week that it will wait for the outcome of a planning application before it decides what to do with the trees that local people are campaigning to save.Ards and North Down Borough Council lodged a planning application with its own planning department last December  to gain permission to build an extended car and coach on its own land near the popular visitor venue.The project has been controversial since local conservationists discovered last year that in order to build the car-park, nine mature protected trees would need to be removed.It was later confirmed that the council did not have the authority to remove the trees under a permitted development and needed to apply for planning permission for the car-park which should have been competed by next month.The Portaferry Stop The Trees campaign gathered more than , names in opposition to the trees cull and even offered the council an alternative design which would have saved the trees but resulted in less parking spaces. The design was rejected by the council.The campaign started last May when contractors turned up with equipment and portacabins and marked the trees for felling.Local resident Lily Devlin noticed the development and started the campaign, first rallying support via her Facebook page, and then starting an online petition.Speaking on behalf of the Save the Trees Campaign group, Cathie McKimm said: ldquoThe council got this wrong from the beginning.ldquoWe now have a situation where the council are applying for planning permission for a project they have already appointed contractors for and the project has increased by almost % in cost.ldquoIn bringing in experts to late at a huge cost to the ratepayer to fix the many mistakes theyrsquove made, including failing to include a drainage system in a flood risk area, the council are now having to contribute more than pound, to this scheme and growing, whereas before they were only contributing approximately pound, for the same scheme. ldquoGiven all the conflicts of interest that the council now have we do not believe they can assess this planning application objectively, and believe that the Department of Infrastructure needs to call it in and conduct a full investigation about how this has been handled.A council spokesman confirmed that a planning application for the project would follow regulations which apply to all councils throughout Northern Ireland in making its decision.He said: ldquoThe council will let matters follow due process, mindful of the procedures put in place by the Department for such planning applications.He also confirmed that the project, which was planned as a local tourism boost, had increased in costs.ldquoThe council has applied for and obtained funding of pound, towards the project.

Daffodils are peaking out of the ground, the weather is softening, and the feast of St Brigidrsquos Day , February , has passed.This can mean only one thing ndash lambs! In fact, lambs have been born in our practice since before Christmas. But the majority will be coming to a field near you over the next few weeks.Now, modern flocks have a lot of sheep in them. Indeed, there are about five million sheep in Ireland overall. Thatrsquos one for every man, woman and child.Our domestic sheepis descended from a primitive European ancestor, today found mainly in Corsica. In the past it was common for sheep to havejust one lamb. But today, thanks to better feeding, shelter and shepherding, it is possible for sheep to have twins, triplets and even quads!This abundance can come with problems though. Whata sheep doesnrsquot have enough milk to feed this many lambs  Well, farmers have come up with a number of solutions.The first is lsquopet lambsrsquo. These lambs are hand reared. They are fed with a bottle using condensed milk from commercial suppliers. Or the milk can be taken from another ewe who is producing a lot.As anyone with a baby will tell you, this solution is labour intensive and will keep the shepherd working around the clock. But they are dedicated, and they do it! It is not always sustainable in the long run. Another solution is fostering.Lamb fostering is where a ewe adopts the lamb from another ewe. The reasons for fostering can be manold. A lack of milk is one of the major reasons. The ewe may not want to take on another lamb, not recognising it as her own, but shepherds have adapted one of naturersquos many wonders to encourage it to happen.They use a technique called olfactory imprinting. Have you ever wondered how a ewe can recognise her own lamb in a flock of hundreds  One reason is that, just after birth, the ewe learns the smell of her newborn. This is what olfactory imprinting means.Shepherds can take advantage of this amazing process by rubbing some of the birthing fluid of the newborn lamb into the wool of the lamb to be fostered. The ewe will then accept the lamb as one of her own, and feed and care for it. The lives of many lambs are saved in this way.So when you next look at the fields of Lecale, check out the sheep and seeyou can tell them apart. Evenyou canrsquot, their mums can!.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ulster Aviation Society left ‘dismayed’ over council at Festival of Flight decision  ","story":"THE decision by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to cancel this summerrsquos international Festival of Flight in Newcastle was taken without consulting one of its key partners, it has emerged.Last weekrsquos decision to pull the plug on the event mdash which was last held in  mdash was taken in secret during a meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Tourist and Regeneration Committee.It is understood that no contact was made with the Ulster Aviation Society which has played a major role since the inaugural festival and described its disappointment at the cancellation decision.Regularly attracting in the region of , people to the resort in the summer, the flagship tourist event has been a major success for over a decade.Council officials say that due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the pandemic, organising this yearrsquos event would not be possible.Some councillors believe that given the local authorityrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades in Downpatrick and Newry are set to go ahead next month and with the further easing of Covid regulations, some form of airshow could have been organised for Newcastle this summer.This week, Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis urging the council to confirm that next yearrsquos festival will go ahead.The Ulster Aviation Society said it was ldquodisappointed and dismayed about the cancellation of the airshow and the fact that the organisation had not been consulted.Society chairman Ray Burrows said it was ldquoastonishing that the event had been ldquoshot down in secret, with no reasonable explanation.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has urged the local council to ldquograsp the opportunity and organise an alternative event, suggesting a large scale festival that incorporates and builds on the most popular elements of the Festival of Flight.He is keen to see an event showcasing the regionrsquos ldquooutstanding food and drink offering with Newcastle a designated venue for arts, culture and music events to create opportunities showcasing the entrepreneurial spirit and pioneering innovation of the district.Mr Burrows said while these were ldquoall excellent suggestions, he said as elements in addition to, or within, the Festival of Flight, surely not as a replacement for it.He continued: ldquoThat said, we would be pleased indeed to meet with the council or the mayor to discuss the matter. We want to help Newcastle demonstrate in a powerful, popular way how important our aviation future and heritage are to Northern Ireland.ldquoThatrsquos exactly what did in recent years, before Covid.ldquoWe [the UAS] had probably the most popular exhibition within the ground-based event and thousands of parents have brought their children for photographs in our Spitfire and our Alouette helicopter, at no charge.Mr Burrows suggested that unless the councilrsquos decision is reversed, or at least re-assessed, he expects there will be tremendous disappointment from the public.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic it was also grounded.Urging the local authority to confirm that it will be chocks away for next summerrsquos Festival of Flight, Cllr Lewis said that for the past two years, the organisation has been unable to deliver a tourism events programme due to the impact of Covid-.ldquoAlthough the possible impact of future Covid iants is dficult to predict, it is hoped that larger scale events can resume this summer. This will be a welcome boost to residents and the local trade and hospitality sectors, he continued.ldquoCouncil research indicates that almost poundm was generated in  for the district as a direct result of tourism events. Therefore, it is bitterly disappointing that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight will not be going ahead.Cllr Lewis said the income that it would have generated would be a welcome boost to traders in the town and benefit the collective tourism industry across South Down.He continued: ldquoWe must not underestimate the huge draw of this annual festival. I note that council officers have said that throughout this past  months they had continued to engage with key stakeholders including the RAF.ldquoIt was advised that due to challenges planning the festival, securing air assets and the uncertainty of the pandemic that it has not been possible to host the festival of flight this year.Cllr Lewis revealed that he has been contacted by many aviation enthusiasts who are bitterly disappointed that the festival wonrsquot go ahead.He added: ldquoI fail to see how the event couldnrsquot have at least been planned for later in the year, now that we know the majority of restrictions are to be lted.

For example, we will also show respect and liberty toward those who wish to continue wearing face coverings, either entering or leaving our buildings or while seated for worship.“Our worship services are open to all – our own members and adherents, and also any from the public at large who wish to visit. We must emphasise our gratitude to the Lord for His mercy in bringing us to this point where church le is more back to full ministry at all levels.”• The Free Presbyterian general presbytery, in a statement this week, said: “We give thanks to God for looking upon the nation in mercy, and withdrawing the more extreme symptoms of the covid pandemic, which caused death and serious illness. “We are grateful for removal of all statutory restrictions upon our public worship and have authorised our sessions and committees to take the necessary steps, transitioning our people back to normality. We continue to pray for all who have been affected by the pandemic through bereavement and illness and that they will know God’s grace and comfort.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Prior to being in Lurgan, the organisation’s administrative base was located in Dublin and Belfast.The Royal Black moved out of Brownlow House in  to temporary premises in Loughgall, beside the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan’s House.Now, the institution is looking forward to taking up residence in their own purpose-built administrative centre.“The opening of our new headquarters will be a landmark day in the history of the Royal Black Institution,” said Rev Anderson.“This project has been one of the biggest and most important ever undertaken by the Imperial Grand Black Chapter of the British Commonwealth.“The need for our own headquarters was discussed and agreed in , we purchased the Loughgall building in , renovation work began in May , and I’m delighted to say we’re ready to cut the ribbon on Saturday, April .“It has been a long road to get to this point, and there have been many challenges along the way. “We had originally hoped to open the building in , so that the unveiling would form part of our celebrations for the centenary of Northern Ireland. However, the Covid pandemic wreaked havoc with our work schedule. But we were fairly relaxed about the delay as our focus was always about completing the building to a high standard rather than rushing to a completion date.“There are so many people to thank for all their hard work but I would like to take this opportunity to pay special tribute to the contractors, Weir Bros Construction, for their professionalism and attention to detail, and to our own clerk of works, Edgar Patterson, and quantity surveyor, Keith Anderson, and the entire Royal Black HQ project team, for their passion, commitment and expertise over the last few years.“Thanks to the efforts of everyone involved, we now have modern headquarters from which we can proudly maintain our stand for the Reformed Faith and strengthen our Christian and charitable outreach.”The building itself has an interesting history. At one stage it was a public house known as the Rock Tavern. Afterwards, a temperance advocate, Cecilia Cope, turned it into a coffee house.

It was silly, but to give Jimmy his due there was always a wee message in it, just like the work I do with the Gang today. “Always, each side of the community got an equal send up, again just like what we do with Give My Head Peace. It was all very even.“At that time I was still working in the court house for Antrim County Council because in those days, unless you were wealthy, actors could never afford to give up their day jobs. You were in the performing arts for the love of it.Olivia and her late husband Bill whom she married on June , . The couple went on to have one daughter, Patricia“I would come out of the court house like the clappers and get a bus up Royal Avenue to the Group Theatre. Sometimes we would do double shows for three weeks over Easter and over Christmas, but it was so much fun, you didn’t resent being so busy.“Every six months we changed the show, but when we would do two shows, the same people who were into theatre would be sitting there every single Saturday. People would come to the play at half six, go to John Long’s fish and chip shop for their tea and then sometimes be back in time for the second performance.”Olivia recalls that the love of her le, her late husband Bill, whom she met through the Larne Drama Circle, died of an aneurysm in .“Bill and I were always trying to get married, and I would say, ‘I’ll just do another play, Bill, and then we’ll get married.’ Olivia as a cherubic child. She began elocution lessons at the tender age of three and has been performing in one way or another ever since“We got married on June , , and got a flat, and we put every penny we got into it, and we just thought we were the bees’ knees. “Then in August of ‘ internment came in and absolutely everything stopped, the city went dark and the curtains came down in the theatres. No plays, nothing, and there was Bill and I sitting like two prunes, albeit in love.“There’s not a day goes by when I don’t miss him, but after his death I had to raise my daughter Patricia who was just ten then, and le had to go on. My love of acting sustained me.”She first joined Tim ‘and the boys’ on BBC NI’sPerforated Ulster and then came the call to join the cast of Give My Head Peace for what would go on to become the now iconic satirical series in  and ever since nobody has dared cross, or targe, the inimitable doyenne of the dramedy.‘I’M ACTUALLY VERY SHY OUTSIDE A ROLE’“At age three I was signed up to do elocution lesson,” says Olivia. “I was always used to standing up and speaking.“Basically though, and people may be very surprised by this, but I am actually very shy, and I hate going into rooms with people who I don’t really know, because I always think, ‘well why would they want to talk to me ’ “So I was always nervous, but I never had any qualms about going on stage and I always did a lot of public speaking.“At first, when I started to do it, I used to pretend that I was somebody , for about the first two minutes and that’s what got me through.“With drama you can be very shy, but when you take on a role you become somebody , and there’s a real liberation in that because you no longer feel self-conscious - you are transformed when you play a particular part.”Nash added: “When I left school, I joined Larne Drama Circle at the age of  and it was the making of me as a performer and to this day all of us are like family, my family outside my family - %.”‘IF YOU CAN MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH TOGETHER, THAT’S REALLY OVERCOMING DIVISION’Olivia, who starred in the iconic Billy Plays in the s alongside a very young Sir Kenneth Branagh and the late Jimmy Ellis, whom she remembers as an “absolute gentleman”, received her MBE in  not just for the rich tapestry of her theatre work but also for her uwavering support for the Northern Ireland Hospice for whom she has gone on innumerable fundraising walks and loves to visit to chat and entertain patients. She feels all of us could learn some perspective, namely “how to stop grumbling about things that don’t matter”, from witnessing the incredible work they do there.But today she feels blessed beyond measure, that besides working in radio which allows her to play a “tall, slim blonde” when she feels like it, she is delighted to be part of a show that frequently flags up the absurdity of our sectarian politics and entrenched, ludicrous ision where we could have unity and fraternity.”No disrespect to Stormont, butthe cast of Give My Head Peace had a half an hour up there, I think it would get politicians on both sides of the ide working together much better. “If I had a pound for all the times people stop me in the street and tell me how much Give My Head Peace made them laugh and upllted them, whatever circumstances they were going through, I would be very rich, and I feel very privilegedto have been allowed to be a part of something so wonderful, which I think very much shows that whether you are orange, green or neither, there is so much more that unites rather than ides us in Northern Ireland. “There is barely a day when somebody doesn’t shout out ‘Ma!’ to me in the street.”It’s obvious the gang are thick as thieves and Olivia tells an hilarious story about a programme special they did on the continent when she fell a*** over face into a freezer trying to retrieve some prawns, with a passerby having to pull her out by the ankles, which became comedy gold in one episode, and on a special set in Rome when they had the full humour of Uncle Billy wanting to meet the Pope.How does Ma keep Da in line, I wonder  “Oh that’s my secret,” laughs Olivia. “Da gives her a hard time, but, as in so many households, it all runs off Ma like water off a duck’s back.\u2028“You know I’ve a fabulous family, great friends and an acting career that allows me to do one of the most wonderful things, which is to make people laugh even in the midst of their own personal struggles and to be able to spread joy.“And to me the arts and comedy deserve more respect than they are often afforded, becauseyou can make people laugh together, that’s really overcoming ision.”‘IF I HAD A MAGIC WAND, I’D MAKE EDUCATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND INTEGRATED’Olivia, who calls Dame Judi Dench her ultimate acting inspiration, not only because of the incredible range that has allowed her to do everything from Shakespeare to the Bond franchise but also because she seems “so lovely” in interviews, recalls being repeatedly in trouble at school because she was simply born a very chatty and bubbly livewire.“I was at school in the days of the slap, as it were, and I had lots of them. I hold my hands up, I was always talking too much in class.”After joining Larne Drama Circle at  she was involved in so many dferent productions and drama festivals, appearing in comedies and plays like Brian Friel’s The Loves of Cass McGuire, Tea in a China Cup and even musicals. “Our church had a very strong music society and I cannot sing for peanuts. If I joined a choir, they would pay me to leave, probably. “But one year we did The Music Man I played Mrs Paroo. It was like speak-sing, you spoke it to the beat. We went to Waterford for the festival of light opera and I actually won a prize for best comedienne and to this day I can’t stop laughing about that or marvelling at how it actually came about. “The next year, we did Brigadoon, and I had a part as Meg Brockie, and one of her songs was My Mother’s Wedding Day, and I won a prize that year as well!”If Olivia had a magic wand and could change anything at all about Northern Ireland over night, she would like to see integrated education implemented here.“I remember growing up in Larne, being wheeled about with my friend in a buggy. She was a Protestant, and she was my best friend. Then, because I was a Catholic, she and I had to go to dferent schools when we got older, and I could never understand it.”Olivia added:“We should be together and everybody should be allowed to follow whatever religion they want to follow without it being a question of you being right and the other person being wrong, or anyone trying to impose their beliefs on anybody . “We need to have mutual respect for each other and I think integrated education is the way forward in trying to make that a reality.”See Give My Head Peace  on tour on March -, at the Market Place Theatre, Armagh March , at the Alley Theatre, Strabane March , at The McNeill Theatre, Larne March -, at the Riverside Theatre, Coleraine March , at the Strule Arts Centre, Omagh March -, at the Millennium Forum, Londonderry March , at the Theatre at the Mill, Newtownabbey March , at The Braid, Ballymena March -, at The Ardhowen Theatre, Enniskillen March -, at the Burnavon Theatre, Cookstown and March -April , at the Grand Opera House, Belfast.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Here’s a list of all the key fees and charges set to rise at the start of the next financial year in April.Dedicated benches will increase from £ to £., and dedication trees will increase from £ to £.Beach hut booking fees will increase. During summer renting a large beach hut for a full day will go from £. to £., and for a half day from £. to £ while a small beach hut will increase from £ to £. for a full day and £. to £. for a half day. Annual passes for large huts will go from £ to £., and small huts from £ to £..Two excursion boats which stop at Penarth will have to pay much more to dock at Penarth Pier. The Waverly is an old paddle steamer, while the Balmoral is a pleasure steamer. Both boats currently pay £. in docking charges, but this will increase to £ on weekdays, £ on Saturdays and £ on Sundays.At Cosmeston Lakes, launching boats, riding horses, and orienteering will increase in price. Tours around the Mediaeval Village will also increase slightly in price. Horse riding and orienteering will also increase in price at Porthkerry Country Park. The price of getting married at all three venues remains the same at £,.Last year the Vale council controversially brought in new charges for cafes and restaurants to have outdoor tables and chairs. Their aim is to limit how much space some cafes take up on the pavement, “decluttering” town centres across the Vale, but businesses some objected to the fees. These fees, for ‘public furniture’, will not increase in April..removeCharges for bowling greens are no longer set by the council, as these were transferred over to bowling green clubs.Details of all the planned increases were revealed in a cabinet report. The council’s cabinet will meet on Monday, February , to sign off the budget proposals before they go to the full council for approval on March .The cabinet report said: “As public funding becomes increasingly constrained and under more intense scrutiny, greater emphasis has to be placed upon self-generated income and developing and presenting products and services that will resonate with paying customers.“As revenue budgets have reduced in recent years, income from fees and charges becomes ever more important as a way of sustaining priority services.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

RNLI Penarth reports that “everyone aboard was recovered safely but unfortunately the boat couldn’t be saved”.The volunteer crew alerted the public that the sinking boat was taken to Penarth beach for salvage to avoid it being lost at sea.The broken-up boat was cleared from Penarth beach on Sunday, February , with the RNLI working with HM Coastguard and Vale of Glamorgan Council to “resolve the situation” and advising people to stay clear while work was carried out due to potential hazards.“We’re pleased to say that the broken-up boat has now been cleared from Penarth beach,” reports RNLI Penarth.“Thank you to HM Coastguard and Vale of Glamorgan council for their great work making the beach safe again.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Both presidents hope that the situation in Ukraine will improve signicantly and rapidly so that football can again be a vector for unity and peace amongst people.”Spartak Moscow’s removal from the Europa League will hand RB Leipzig direct progression into the European second-tier competition’s quarter-finals.European football bosses UEFA also confirmed the cessation of its sponsorship deals with Russian energy company Gazprom, worth around £million a season.“UEFA has today decided to end its partnership with Gazprom across all competitions,” read a UEFA statement..remove“The decision is effective immediately and covers all existing agreements including the UEFA Champions League, UEFA national team competitions and UEFA EURO .”The suspension should put a stop to Russia’s World Cup play-off semi-final next month.IOC Executive Board recommends no participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes and officialshttps:t.co XZyLIiXR— IOC MEDIAFebruary , The International Olympic Committee’s executive board issued a recommendation to international sports federations earlier on Monday to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes, officials and teams from international competitions wherever possible.That IOC executive board decision effectively gave a green light to FIFA to go further than it previously had, and to exclude Russia from the World Cup.The IOC said the exclusion recommendation had been made “in order to protect the integrity of global sports competitions and for the safety of all the participants”.It is the strongest move taken yet by the international sports community to isolate Russia from global competition.World Rugby denounced Russia’s “aggressive invasion”, adding the country’s actions have been facilitated by Belarus, and the governing body has therefore decided to suspend both countries “from all international rugby and cross-border club rugby activities until further notice” with full and immediate effect.The Rugby Union of Russia has also been suspended from World Rugby membership.The British Olympic Association also issued a statement calling for the removal of Russia and Belarus from all top sporting competition.FIFA had faced criticism over its initial decision on Sunday night to allow Russia to continue to compete in the men’s World Cup play-offs, but on neutral territory and under the Football Union of Russia banner.Manchester City’s Ukraine defender Oleksandr Zinchenko posted on Instagram calling for the exclusion of Russia from all international sports governing bodies and the country’s athletes from participating in international competitions.FIFPRO calls for suspension of the Russian Football Union. pic xbqWTvyr— FIFPROFebruary , Football’s world players’ union, FIFPRO, also called for the expulsion of the RFU.“Russia’s aggression and the united response of democracies around the world have shown that the defence of human dignity and the rule of law are being tested,” a FIFPRO statement read.“Football, and sport, has its own responsibility to respond in turn. Its past policies of political neutrality have failed the test of time, and today must mark a turning point for how sport engages with society, how it stands for democracy and human rights.“A new approach, consistently applied, that rests on sport’s proclaimed values is urgently needed.”Earlier on Monday, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Ireland and the Irish FA joined the English and Welsh FAs in refusing to face Russia in an international fixture at any level.The Scottish FA send a message of support, friendship and unity to the people of Ukraine. pic hSckZTsXz— Scottish FAFebruary , The SFA and FAI also offered their support to the Ukrainian federation with regard to the organisation of matches scheduled against the team later this year.Scotland are due to host Ukraine in a World Cup play-off semi-final in March and then in the Nations League in June, with an away fixture set for September.The Republic are due to play Ukraine twice in the Nations League in June, first at Dublin’s Aviva Stadium and then at a neutral venue unless current UEFA guidance changes.Formula One’s governing body was due to hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss the future of Russian driver Nikita Mazepin.The Automobile Federation of Ukraine president Leonid Kostyuchenko has demanded the FIA bans all Russian and Belarusian drivers from competing outside of their own countries.Ukrainian tennis star Elina Svitolina heaped pressure on the sport’s governing bodies to remove Russian and Belarusian athletes from competition. vw,vw,px, px\"Elina Svitolina is Ukraine’s leading female tennis player .“We, Ukrainian players, requested to ATP, WTA and ITF to follow the recommendations of the IOC to accept Russian or Belarusian nationals only as neutral athletes, without displaying any national symbols, colours, flags or anthems,” Svitolina posted on Instagram.“Accordingly I want to announce that I will not play tomorrow in Monterrey, nor any other match against Russian or Belarusian tennis players until our organisations take this necessary decision.“I do not blame any of the Russian athletes. They are not responsible for the invasion of our motherland.“Moreover, I wish to play tribute to all the players, especially Russians and Belarusians, who bravely stated their position against the war. Their support is essential.”The International Ice Hockey Federationhas suspended all Russian and Belarusian national teams and clubs from all competitions until further notice.Russia has also lost hosting rights for the  IIHF World Junior Championship.“The IIHF strongly condemns the use of military force and urges the use of diplomatic means to solve the conflict,” read an IIHF statement..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: UEFA and FIFA suspend Russia from all competitions article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It has been my privilege to represent North Antrim in the Northern Ireland Assembly since , and I look forward to contesting this election on behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party.The Ulster Unionist Party has confirmed Robin Swann MLA and Bethany Ferris as its candidates for the upcoming elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly“During the past five years, I have worked tirelessly to support constituents across North Antrim as your MLA, and as Northern Ireland’s Health Minister over the most challenging periods of the COVID- pandemic. No one could have anticipated the response that the people of Northern Ireland would have been called upon to make in our battle against COVID-.“I have ensured that clinical and scientic advice has guided Northern Ireland’s response to the pandemic. In particular, I am eternally grateful to the health and social care staff across Northern Ireland, as without their incredible contribution, we could not have gotten through this crisis. Their willingness to go the extra mile over the past two years cannot be understated and must never be forgotten. However, I am forever conscious of the families that have had their lives devastated by COVID and the iniduals who have lost their lives before their time.“Since the collapse of the Assembly last month, my work to rebuild our health service has become infinitely more dficult. My priority of securing a three-year health budget to confront our long-term waiting lists and implement our cancer and mental health strategies have been frustrated by the absence of an Executive. Northern Ireland deserves far better than this.“It has been the honour of my career to serve Northern Ireland and North Antrim in these roles during this mandate of the Assembly. I have been touched by those who have reached out to offer their support and encouragement during these testing times. I look forward to getting out to meet constituents across North Antrim in the coming weeks and sharing the Ulster Unionist Party’s vision for a better Northern Ireland.”Bethany Ferris added: “It is a privilege to have been selected and ratied by the North Antrim Ulster Unionist Association to stand as a candidate in May’s Assembly Election. I look forward to meeting constituents across North Antrim in the coming weeks to share my background and vision for Northern Ireland.“I studied Theology at Union Theological College, and the ethos of pastoral care has heavily influenced my le as I have sought to support those in need. Upon leaving university, I worked for almost five years in the health and social care sector, where I assisted iniduals with learning disabilities, autism, and mental ill-health. As a team leader during the pandemic, I supported our service users by helping them to understand and adjust to the signicant changes in their lives.“I have since taken up a role as an advocate for innocent victims of the Troubles within a leading organisation that supports iniduals whose lives were impacted by terrorism. I have prioritised engagement with future generations to help them understand the impact terrorism had on Northern Ireland and help them understand the immense contributions of iniduals who served with distinction in the Ulster Defence Regiment, Royal Ulster Constabulary, and the wider armed forces family.“I am grateful for the opportunity to stand alongside Robin Swann MLA in this election. Robin has acted as a mentor for me throughout my time in the Ulster Unionist Party, encouraging me to take on increased responsibilities in the Ulster Young Unionists and put my name forward as a Party Officer. Over the last three years, I have worked hard within our Party to help more women and young people come forward as candidates, and I am pleased to join many of them on the ballot paper.“I fully believe in the Ulster Unionist Party’s commitment to delivering a better Northern Ireland at this election. As a young woman, I’m eager to offer North Antrim a fresh voice for change in the Northern Ireland Assembly. I look forward to building on my work in the constituency and meeting voters over the coming weeks.”Read More Read MoreTime running out for Causeway Coast and Glens businesses to apply for Omicron Ho...Northern Ireland  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularGang of youths steal toy BB guns and vaping products while h...NewsUkraine aid: East Antrim collection points for emergency don...NewsMan charged with attempted murder in Ballymena...NewsJudge tells motorist  mph is ‘signicant speed’...NewsPolice respond as around  motorists engaged in antisocial...NewsMost PopularBest inflatable hot tubs : blow-up spa hot tubs, from -...RecommendedCamping stoves UK : the best gas camping stoves in stock...RecommendedValentine’s Day meals: the best supermarket meal deals UK ...RecommendedBest portable solar chargers for camping UK : keep your ...RecommendedThird boutique proves they CAN!...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eaebbcabdbde   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbbcaeeaa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

In a statement in the chamber, the Minister said the scheme injected at least pound.m into the economy, leading to an improved level of consumer confidence and increased levels of public spending. Today, the Department published a set of management information on the Scheme covering: number of residents issued with a cardnumber and percentage of cards activatedtotal spendnumber of transactions and spend by Local Government District andlocation and spend by postcode.The Minister said: “The High Street Scheme has been a huge success and achieved exactly what it set out to do. It brought shoppers back on to the High Street and has helped and supported our local retail, hospitality and service sectors start their journey of recovery from the devastating impact of the pandemic. “I am really pleased to announce that ,, people were issued with a Spend Local card, of which ,, – or .% – were activated. This is a tremendous achievement. The scheme was designed to provide an economic boost to the local economy and to this end pound.million has been injected into the economy. “This can be clearly seen from the fact that nearly .million customers visited our local shops, restaurants, bars, cafeacutes, cinemas, hairdressers across all parts of Northern Ireland during the letime of the Scheme and over .million new transactions were made using the Spend Local card. “Of course, we know that many of these customers will have spent more than the pound on their Spend Local card. So the figure – in real terms – will be greater.” The Minister told the Assembly that the early analysis showed the benefits of the Scheme were enjoyed in all parts of Northern Ireland. He said: “Over poundmillion was spent in Belfast, over poundmillion in Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon while over poundmillion was spent in each of the following local council areas – Newry, Mourne and Down Derry and Strabane Antrim and Newtownabbey Lisburn and Castlereagh and Ards and North Down. In Mid and East Antrim, the figure was over poundmillion. In Causeway Coast and Glens and in Mid Ulster, more than poundmillion was spent, while the figure for Fermanagh and Omagh was just over pound.million.” MLAs heard how the scale of the task of delivering the High Street Scheme was unprecedented as, in a matter of weeks, his Department implemented a process which manufactured, dispatched and delivered cards to close to .million people – each card unique to each applicant, including bespoke embossed cards for the visually impaired and blind. The Minister told MLAs: “The effort was worth it. I am sure that Members will have heard the same positive messages that I have heard from businesses, but it has also been confirmed by independent analysis.” According to an Ulster Bank Survey, retail sales in Northern Ireland rose in November  for the first time in four months. The banks Chief Economist Richard Ramsey said the High Street Scheme undoubtedly contributed to the pick-up in demand. Research in December  also showed an increase in shoppers on Northern Ireland’s high streets. The figures published by the Northern Ireland Retail Consortiumshowed a boost to the number of people going into shops or businesses in October continuing in November following the introduction of the High Street Scheme. In November, the number of shoppers in Northern Ireland reached their highest point so far compared to the pre-pandemic level. The Minister said: “The people from which I was most pleased to hear were the business owners who needed the scheme to help them cope with the impact of the pandemic. On a personal level, these iniduals – shopkeepers, barbers, newsagents, publicans, cafeacute owners, the list goes on – brought it home to me why this scheme was so important.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fcebefccfd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bebadbccfcfaeecdbd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
