Too many people have called me, too many cops I’ve spoken to, that there’s no way it wasn’t discussed.\u0027The director says a law enforcement officer warned him to get a burner phone and cover the camera on his computer. It has caused him to check his doors at night out of fear for what could happen to him. A former FBI agent who also spoke to the publication says Biggie Smalls\u0027 mother, Voletta Wallace, could \u0027absolutely completely bury\u0027 the Los Angeles Police Department if Johnny Depp\u0027s movie City of Lies was released and created a buzz.The family was seeking $400million in a 2002 wrongful death lawsuit that was dismissed 2012 but is eligible to be refiled. Speculation about the reason for the movie being shut down continued in writing, the story states. \u0027Also, they were being warned, even threatened, with the consequences of releasing a film that pointed such a large and sharp finger at the LAPD, and that would put the City of Los Angeles at risk of tremendous liability,\u0027 Sullivan wrote in an email to Furman, reports The Daily Beast. \u0027I’ve seen up close how powerful those threats can be.\u0027    City of Lies is about the investigations into Notorious B.I.G (left) and Tupac\u0027s (right) murders          Director, David Furman, expresses how annoyed he is the lead actor was being used as reason for City of Lies getting blockedIt\u0027s what he goes into in his forthcoming book. \u0027I describe the frightening political machinations that prevented the federal case of LAPD involvement in the Biggie murder from being prosecuted.

More than 10,000 minors to sign up since mandatory military service ended in 2011In 2017, 2,128 people under 18 joined the German army, up 11.4 percent from 2016 and accounting for 9 percent of new recruits, according to government data.With lively music and scenes showing the lives of young soldiers, the Bundeswehr\u0027s shows on YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet, have attracted more than 64 million views.In October, traffic at the Bundeswehr jobs website increased 60 percent during a six-week broadcast of \u0027Mali\u0027, a YouTube series centred on eight soldiers serving in the U.N.\u0027s peacekeeping mission in the West African country.The Bundeswehr Exclusive YouTube channel has over 330,000 followers and its latest production portrays the lives of a group of young paratroopers. The army is also active on other sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.According to a Trendence Institut survey of 20,000 school students across the country, the military is now considered Germany\u0027s third most attractive employer, behind sportswear maker Adidas and the police in first place.Overall, the army spent about 35 million euros ($40 million) on recruitment last year, more than double its spending in 2011, the year compulsory military service ended, annual parliament reports about the Bundeswehr showed.\u0027The Bundeswehr today is a volunteer army ... Therefore, it must approach young people to win them over,\u0027 a spokeswoman for the personnel management department at the Bundeswehr said.Before signing up, Marlon said he browsed the army\u0027s website and watched a series of YouTube videos.He needed his mother\u0027s consent to join because he was under 18, but she was happy to give it and is now pleased her once-messy son has become more organised, Marlon said.

Here’s why.Like all monkeys and apes, humans are social. We have an urgent desire to schmooze and an awareness that alcohol helps our cause.Friendships protect us against outside threats and internal stresses, and this has been key to our evolutionary success. Primate social groups, unlike most other animals, rely on bondedness to maintain social coherence.And for humans, this is where a shared bottle of red wine plays a powerful role. It isn’t just because alcohol causes us to lose our social inhibitions and become over-friendly with our drinking chums.Rather, the alcohol itself triggers the brain mechanism that is intimately involved in building and maintaining friendships in monkeys, apes and humans. This mechanism is the endorphin system. Popular Instagram fitness model is arrested for mowing down...Two passed out toddlers are rescued from the back of a hot...Share this articleEndorphins (the word is a contraction of ‘endogenous morphine) are neurotransmitters that are intimately involved, through their opiate-like effects, in the management of pain.That opiate-like all’s-well-with-the-world effect seems to be crucial for establishing bonded relationships that allow iniduals to trust each other.Drinking, seen in this light, is a profound activity. It enables humans to open up their deepest selves, giving another twist to the ancient saying ‘in vino veritas’ (in wine, truth).Of the many social activities that trigger the endorphin system in humans (they range from laughter to singing and dancing), the consumption of alcohol seems to be one of the most effective.At detox clinics, one increasingly common form of treatment is to dose an addict with an endorphin blocker that locks onto the brain’s endorphin receptors but is pharmacologically neutral, so you don’t get the hit when you drink. Instead, you get a mild form of cold turkey.          Alcohol triggers the brain mechanism that is intimately involved in building and maintaining friendshipsHumans have a long association with alcohol that reaches back into the mists of prehistory. Archaeologists such as Patrick McGovern from the University of Pennsylvania Museum have found residues of fermentation in clay vessels in China dating back more than 8,000 years.There is an emerging view among some archaeologists that the reason humans started cultivating grains such as wheat and barley was not to make bread (as everyone had previously assumed) but to make a gruel that could be fermented. One reason for this thinking is that primitive cereals cultivated in the Middle East during the Neolithic period, have a different gluten structure, making it more difficult to make good bread.They do, however, make a very good gruel that ferments well. If you had to choose between a tasteless, soggy flatbread and a glass of beer, well it’s a no-brainer, isn’t it?While the big innovation of the Neolithic may have been brewing rather than agriculture, the exploitation of naturally fermenting fruits may have a much longer history.Elephants in southern Africa and India have a penchant for eating fermented fruits and can become quite woozy on it.Primatologist Kim Hockings, of Exeter University, has studied west African chimpanzees that habitually steal the palm wine left fermenting in trees by local farmers. And Robert Dudley, from the University of California Berkeley, claims that we share with the apes a unique genetic mutation dating back 12 million years that allows us to break down the alcohols in over-ripe fruits.For humans, if not for elephants, fermented drinks play a central role in feasts the world over — and feasts are all about friendships. And it is probably in this respect that alcohol plays a seminal role.We need friends because they provide help when we need an extra hand, or someone to listen with a modicum of empathy to a tale of woe.          Boris Johnson shares a pint with Zac Goldsmith at Leadenhall Market in London But friendship, it turns out, has other hidden benefits.One of the biggest surprises of the last decade or so has been the torrent of publications showing that our happiness, health and susceptibility to disease — even our speed of recovery from surgery and how long we live — are all influenced by the number of friends we have.One study by Julianne Holt-Lunstad collated the results of 148 studies of heart attack patients. The aim was to determine what it was that best predicted the probability of surviving for 12 months after a first heart attack.Aside from sampling a large number of people, it was based on a hard-nosed outcome: survival or death. And the best predictor? The number and quality of friendships you had.A short way behind that was giving up smoking (no surprises there). Then, way further down in terms of impact came exercise, obesity, alcohol consumption, quality of diet and even air quality.It seems you can eat, drink and slob about as much as you want and it won’t affect your chances anything like as much as having a few good friends.Loneliness is a health threat in the western world, and the UK even has a dedicated minister to address the problem.How to solve it is a huge challenge, but encouraging people to socialise over a few beers or some wine at the village pub may be a good place to start.While the role of alcohol in sustaining the friendship networks that provide us with psychological and emotional support is crucial, the endorphins triggered by what we do with friends may have hidden benefits. They appear to tune the immune system by activating the body’s T-cells — part of the defence mechanism that gives us resistance to many common ailments.I’ve lost track of how many times I have been told by ex-military folk that they were never so ill as when they returned to civvy street. It wasn’t that they weren’t as fit as they had been in the forces it was that they kept falling ill with coughs and colds and the detritus of everyday life.When I mentioned the camaraderie of Army life, the odd pint and all that exercise on the drill square, they immediately got the point.Exercise, alcohol and friends — three great ways to trigger endorphins. Of course, like anything biological, overdo the alcohol and you’re on the downward curve before you know it. But then that’s true of everything we eat.           For humans,  a shared bottle of red wine plays a powerful roleProteins, salt, fats and sugars are all good for you, but have too much and you’ll be pitched into the diseases of civilisation — diabetes, obesity, cancers, hypertension, you name it.The same is true of alcohol. A few drinks will relax you and make you more sociable: they even seem to do you some good. But have the proverbial one too many, and you end up paying a price.This was borne out by a recent article in the British Medical Journal reporting on a study of 9,000 Whitehall civil servants whose drinking habits and health had been studied over several decades.Those who had consumed no alcohol in their 40s and 50s, along with those who had typically consumed more than the official government guideline of 14 units a week, had a significantly increased risk of dementia later in life.Those who did not drink at all had a 50 per cent greater risk of developing dementia than those who drank moderately, and the same risk applied to those who drank heavily (more than about 40 units a week).Drinking more than 60 units a week (roughly equivalent to a bottle of wine a day) doubled their risk.These results may be even more interesting than at first seems to be the case. The study didn’t look at friendship as a factor, but I am struck by the pattern.People who drink moderately tend to be social drinkers, whereas heavy drinkers ramp up their consumption because they often drink alone at home — or drink past the point of being able to engage in the kinds of conversations on which friendships are built.It may be these results actually reflect the fact that social drinking creates networks of friendships, and it is being embedded in a supportive network that protects against dementia as much as anything else.Friends engage us in conversation in ways that keep the brain ticking over, as well as providing us with endorphin-related health benefits. When we meet over a beer, we talk, laugh, tell stories, occasionally even sing and dance.All of these have been shown to trigger the endorphin system, and so help the process of social bonding as well as the processes of healing. At the University of Oxford, we recently undertook a set of studies in collaboration with the Campaign for Real Ale to look at the benefits of old-style community pubs relative to the high street bars that have come to dominate our social horizons in recent years. One component of this was a national survey of pub use.          People who drink moderately tend to be social drinkers, whereas heavy drinkers ramp up their consumption because they often drink alone at homeRather strikingly, this showed that people who had a ‘local’ that they patronised regularly had more close friends, felt happier, were more satisfied with their lives, more embedded into their local communities, and more trusting of those around them.Those who never drank did consistently worse on all these criteria, while those who frequented a local did better than regular drinkers who had no local that they visited regularly.A more detailed analysis suggested that it was the frequency of pub visits that lay at the heart of this: it seemed that those who visited the same pub more often were more engaged with, and trusting of, their local community, and as a result had more friends.In a separate study of social eating, we found that eating with others also positively affected these same outcomes, especially if this was done in the evening.When we asked what other things happened during the meal that might have produced these effects, the three things most frequently listed were laughter, reminiscences and — yes, you’ve guessed it — the consumption of alcohol, all three of which are good at triggering the endorphin system.The fact that evening meals, in this study, seemed to be more important than lunchtime meals is interesting, because there seems to be something especially magical about doing social things in the evening that enhances all these effects. Think of the very different buzz you get from going to an evening performance at the theatre compared to the matinee.This may well be a hangover that dates back 400,000 years to the time we mastered fire. Doing so allowed our early ancestors to shift all their social bonding activities to the evening, so freeing off a lot of extra time during daylight for foraging and other economically essential activities. Add a few fermenting fruits to the mix and...In the flickering light of the campfire, you can’t do much that requires keen eyesight such as sewing or making tools, but you can chat away across the flames.This is nicely illustrated by what South African San Bushmen talk about around their campfires.When anthropologist Polly Wiesner listened in on their conversations, she found daytime conversations typically consisted of boring factual topics and discussions of trading agreements with neighbours, but evening conversations were invariably about social topics or involved stories and jokes.Friendships work because they provide us with ‘a shoulder to cry on’ on that handful of occasions when our world falls apart.But friendships have to be set up ahead of need if they are to work for us, and that means investing a lot of time in them.Our studies suggest we devote 40 per cent of our available social time (and the same proportion of our emotional capital) to an inner core of about five shoulders-to-cry-on. And we devote another 20 per cent to the next ten people who are socially most important to us. In other words, about two-thirds of our total social effort is devoted to just 15 people.That is a very substantial commitment, and amounts to an average of about two hours a day. It makes it all the more necessary that what we do with them is fun, otherwise they won’t keep coming back for more.So, if you want to know the secret of a long and happy life, money is not the answer.Get rid of the takeaway in front of the telly and bin the hasty sandwich at your desk: the important thing is to take time out with people you know and talk to them over a beer or two, even a bottle of Prosecco if you really must.There’s nothing quite like a convivial evening wrapped around a pint to give you health, happiness and a sense of well-being.Robin Dunbar is Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of the British Academy.

This ancient practice involves crouching over a pot of bubbling water enriched with herbs for about 30 minutes, roughly about the time it takes to steam a small Christmas pudding.It is supposed to be good for you, although many health professionals disapprove.There will also be yoni printing (oh God, surely not) plus various sinister sounding classes including Mothering the Moon Maiden, Sex Magic Rituals and a Shamanic Bee Smoking Ceremony. What?We’re going to be cracking out the Rizlas and smoking bees? That doesn’t sound very nice at all. Or even vegetarian.          A lady enjoys herself at Woman Fest, the United Kingdom’s first major female-only festivalOne of the 200 or so souls at the festival is PR guru and Ab Fab inspiration Lynne Franks, who lives nearby.‘Jan,’ she scolds. ‘I hope you are not going to take the mickey out of this incredible occasion? Tiana has done an amazing job. And make sure you visit the Tree Sisters.’Tiana Jacout is the founder of Woman Fest and is pictured on their website wearing a giant headdress made of stag antlers and feathers about which, Lynne, I am saying nothing.The 30-year-old creator insists that the radical participation festival is not an ‘anti-men symposium’ and, instead, sees it as an opportunity for women to congregate, support and learn from each other.‘We want to celebrate women’s creativity and potential,’ she says.Tiana trained as a five-element acupuncturist (based on Fire, Earth, Metal, Water and Wood) and an Emotional Freedom Technique practitioner, skills she used when she set up a clinic in the Calais migrant Jungle after spending a few years on an ashram.Her mother, Rikki, a veteran of the Eighties Greenham Common anti-nuclear protest, recently toured Italy with a clown workshop.On the website, Tiana writes passionately of her inspiration. ‘We have gathered since the beginning of time! We are the granddaughters of the witches you failed to burn. We are the spinsters, the crones, the women who would not be sold as cattle,’ she thunders.Crikey.All this takes place on Critchill Manor Estate, just outside Frome, where we bee-smoking, undead crones pitch our tents by the lake and admire the energy and imagination that powered this festival into being.On the left, past the tent vagina, is a chill-out area with hay bales and hammocks, next to a giant macramé tree of life symbol. To the right, by the lake, is a spa — featuring an ingenious wood-fire sauna in a cowboy wagon, plus two hot-tubs and showers.Naked women of all shapes and sizes ply their way between the tubs or skinny dip in the lake.‘Actually I’m not naked,’ one of them explains, even though she is patently wearing nothing. ‘I’m taking a wind bath.’At the entrance to the spa is the Manifestation Tree, a weeping willow where Woman Festers have tied their secret wishes on leaf-shaped pieces of yellow card.‘I wish to embrace my inner child and to support others,’ reads one message. ‘I wish to create strong sisterhood and empowerment,’ says another. ‘I wish to smash the patriarchy,’ writes another, in angry capital letters.The camp stretches up an incline in a narrow field and features a marquee called the Expressions Tent where food is served at one end — boiled eggs or almond milk porridge with pumpkin seeds for brekkie.In the opposite corner, a regular stream of women come in to kneel at a small altar, heads bowed in silent contemplation as they study what seem to be tiny missals.Pray, what deity inspires such devotion among the sisters? Only when I get closer do I see that it is a phone recharging station.Stretching up the hill are a collection of tipis and tents, including the Womyn Rising tent, the Woman’s Circle tent, the Woodland Tipi and the rather scary Red Tent.Women who are ‘on their moon’ are invited to visit the Red Tent, where I imagine they spent hours shouting: ‘Who touched my camomile teabags?’ and ‘Stop looking at me like that.’The Festers themselves come from all classes — those who cannot afford the ticket price are invited along as volunteers — and either seem to be millennials or baby boomers. Presumably those in-between are too busy raising families or smashing the glass ceiling to bother with sacred unity consciousness and the like.A lot of Festers are wearing evening gowns and face glitter, drifting through the stubble in the field like morning goddesses, visiting the toilets where they are invited to ‘take one scoop per poop’ from the sawdust bins and ‘sprinkle the stardust’ after them.One man-free bonus? All agree that these are the cleanest and most fragrant (relatively speaking) festival loos ever.One morning I join the queue at the Woodland Tipi, where the yoni steaming takes place.Aren’t you worried that many doctors say it does more harm than good, I ask a devotee?‘Well think about it,’ she says. ‘Your mouth and your yoni are at opposite ends of your spine, so it makes sense.’ It does? ‘Yes. It gives you balance. And afterwards you say to yourself, I am steamed and I am cleaned.’You do? Like an old banger leaving a car wash? I never do find out, as the yoni steaming is wildly over-subscribed and yoni mistress Lorraine can’t fit everyone into her schedule.The deep feeling of relaxation and camaraderie that being in an all-female camp engenders is a joy — it’s like being back in the Brownies, except Festers are dreaming of a new yoni instead of a new pony. Yet I do wonder if all this focus on the yoni is entirely mindful and healthy? I mean, what would we call it if a bunch of men went off into the green wilderness to contemplate their penises for a few days?‘We’d call it a golf weekend,’ says Coral from Wiltshire, who is sitting on a milking stool in the Sacred Garden.Time for more enlightenment, so I join the Fool Expression class, held by Christie Holly Tree.Twelve of us sit in a circle of cushions while she explains the concept. Something about the role of the jester in history and how it is a way to inner peace? This is hard to grasp and anyway, wasn’t the jester always a — whisper it — man?All too soon, Christie puts on some plinky-plonky music and we all have to stand up and perform, letting our inner jester out. Oh God. I wobble about like a weeble, sometimes doing a flute-playing Jethro Tull on one leg. You can’t say I’m not trying.Among my fellow Fools one woman is shaking her shoulders and making the kind of grunting noises you’d expect from a copulating mammoth. Kaftan-wearing Ollie, a plucky 71-year-old from Essex, is doing the twist.Next to her, a woman in red velvet is on all fours, barking loudly. Another woman makes kitten ears with her hands and mews.‘I was pretending to be my cat,’ she says later.There is always one, isn’t there?We have to explain what the exercise meant to us.Red Velvet says it ‘stopped the mind chatter’ in her head. One woman says she managed to ‘dance away the pain’ in her neck. Ollie says she felt for the first time in her life that ‘it was OK to be me’.I hear this simple but touching validation over and over at Woman Fest, where so many women seem to be searching for acceptance. However, after the class, I see Dances Away The Pain marching up and down outside the Expressions Tent, bellowing into her iPhone. ‘Tell him from me that I don’t give a s**t,’ she roars, proving that inner peace is elusive, even for jesters.By the camp’s fire pit I talk to Barbra from Buckinghamshire, who is seeking spiritual nourishment and support as she goes through a torrid orce. She has also just been to a jade egg workshop.Oh, tell me about it, I say, as I have signed up for one later, believing it to be some kind of crafting technique. Like marbling or tie dyeing, right?‘Wrong,’ says Barbra. Jade eggs are all about strengthening your pelvic floor, although some women also use them for sexual pleasure and others use them to connect to their grief. You don’t paint them?‘No, you put them inside you.’Inside you? ‘Yes. You choose from small, medium and large sizes, then you put them inside you and you dance around.’          Stock picture of a woman and teenager dancing in a field at duskJade eggs, love eggs, yoni eggs — call them what you will, but they seem to be big business out there on the wilder shores of alternative healing.Gwyneth Paltrow (her again) sells them on her Goop website, where health benefits such as improved sex lives and menstrual cycles are cited.Gynaecologists and doctors, however, are blunt about the eggs — do not insert under any circumstances, is the general message —but as they are freely available in outlets such as Etsy and Amazon, it seems that few are listening.Later, I drift in an out of an egg workshop in the Women’s Circle tent, where keen eggers produce their own sets of crystal or marble eggs in little pouches.Sarah, the teacher, instructs women who have had children to go for the large size, newcomers to take a medium and experts to use the small because their muscles are ‘better developed’.‘Tie a length of non-scented floss around the end loop for easy removal,’ says Sarah, as the dancing begins.Not keen to lay an egg in reverse with a bunch of total strangers, I make my excuses and leave.          A festival goer at Woman Fest holds a bowl of wholesome foodLater, I see many of the women, eggs still intacto, happily dancing around the camp fire.You know something? There is a lot of madness out there.Speaking of which, one afternoon I have a massage, which involves lying face down in a wigwam while tuning forks are pressed against my acupuncture points.‘I am using the Ohm fork on you, which resonates at the same frequency as the earth,’ says Dionne, whose practice is in Birmingham. Whatever. At least it’s an escape from talking about yonis.She strikes the first fork and presses it into my foot. Suddenly I know how Tom in Tom \u0026amp Jerry felt, after Jerry plugged his tail into an electric socket.Combined with a powerful massage I end up feeling like a gong that has been soundly beaten with a rolling pin.I shake all through lunch — no wonder, it is split pea mush and a salad with a solitary cherry tomato — then keep on trembling as we all join hands under a tree and sing a song called Mother, Hear Me Calling.          The festival takes place on Critchill Manor Estate, just outside Frome. All too soon it is time to leave and to consider what I have learned at Woman Fest.First, that Peruvian herbs, whatever they might be, are the latest in thing.Second, that in this age of #MeToo and Time’s Up, gender-specific events such as this won’t drive men and women further apart, but give us all a welcome break from each other.And finally, that even if the womb is our first brain and second heart, as someone keeps insisting, yoni-consciousness festivals such as these are really not my cup of chai. But, ladies, it was fun while it lasted. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/24/23/03C41934000003E8-6096385-Former_Tate_boss_Sir_Nicholas_Serota_above_and_other_high_profil-m-17_1535149858970.jpg","title":"Britains elite universities scrap list levels save arts","story":"    Britain\u0027s most elite universities are considering scrapping or changing their list of preferred A-level subjectsBritain\u0027s most elite universities are considering scrapping or changing their list of preferred A-level subjects following an intervention by art-world luvvies.Former Tate boss Sir Nicholas Serota and other high-profile figures have claimed the arts are being squeezed out as a result of the advice.For seven years the 24 universities of the Russell Group have published guidance on which subjects most often form part of degree requirements – and so are most useful for those who have not yet decided on a course.These are English literature, maths and further maths, biology, chemistry, physics, geography, history, languages and classics. The list of these ‘facilitating subjects’ – often seen as the most academically rigorous – states that those studying at least one of the subjects have a better chance of getting into top universities.Advocates say it has helped stop poorly advised students from taking the wrong A-levels to get into academic courses. But now leading figures in the art world have launched an attack on the list. They say it encourages schools to abandon subjects such as art, music and drama, and could harm the UK’s creative industries.          Former Tate boss Sir Nicholas Serota (above) and other high-profile figures have claimed the arts are being squeezed out as a result of the adviceDocuments released through a Freedom of Information request show the Russell Group is considering scrapping the list.Among options put to members, the group proposes dropping the list altogether or expanding it to include more options. Fifth-grade boy is made to write \u0027ma\u0027am\u0027 repeatedly as...IT teacher who watched horrific abuse of children live on...What \u0027tougher\u0027 new exams?

The number of private schools offering the vocational qualifications has almost doubled in three years – from 53 in 2015 to 93.BTECs were once looked down upon in some elite circles because they are more job-focused. However, a spokesman for the ISC said private schools were becoming ‘less snobbish’ and understood that BTECs were more appropriate for some career paths. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/15/22/2F77351400000578-0-image-a-9_1531691969561.jpg","title":"HMRC taking FIVE MINUTES answer phones overestimating numbers online","story":"    Headquarters of Her Majesty\u0027s Revenue and Customs. 100 Parliament Street, LondonTaxman will now have \u0027shocking\u0027 new powers to raid bank...Tens of thousands of pensioners face income CUTS while...Share this articleHMRC\u0027s annual report admits the failings are down to the fact that it expected more people to be using their digital services.This meant they had not employed enough staff to answer the phone.

It’s not difficult.All you have to do is possess fairly good secretarial skills, a modicum of business sense and a huge dollop of stamina. The real talent and worth of the show is when Lord Alan Sugar silently appears through that glass door, enters the boardroom and gets to work on dissecting the task in hand, discovering who was responsible for its failure or, indeed, success.It was the stamina that did it for me. Which is why, in 2014, I packed it in, because after ten years I’d had enough. I was exhausted and bored and irritable and I thought: right, I’d better get out of this before I become a nuisance. I missed Margaret, who was by then no longer involved.          Karren Brady, Lord Sugar and Nick Hewer pose with the Reality \u0026amp Constructed Factual Award for Young Apprentice in front of the winners boards at The Arqiva British Academy Television Awards 2012We had both stumbled into this unlikely adventure at the same time, and I enjoyed her funny, generous, warm-hearted, obstinate, competitive and uncompromising self.But let’s be fair. It wasn’t all so bad, not by a long chalk. Through The Apprentice I met interesting — sometimes extraordinary — people whom I would never otherwise have encountered. Interestingly, many of these fell from grace shortly after I’d met them — Tony Blair, Alastair Campbell, Philip Green and Rupert Murdoch to name a few. A coincidence? Maybe. Then again, maybe not.TO GET to this point in the story, we need to turn back the clock to 1983, and to the start of my relationship with the phenomenon that is Alan Michael Sugar.BBC bosses will make Lord Sugar do an \u0027unconscious bias...BBC refuses to sack Lord Sugar over racist tweet after...Share this articleI was running a PR company in Covent Garden when a call came through from a man who announced himself as ‘Malcolm Miller, marketing director of Amstrad’, adding: ‘You will have heard of us.’ I demurred for a second and then said, not entirely truthfully: ‘Of course I’ve heard of you.’‘As you know, we’re at the cheap end of the hi-fi business,’ Malcolm had continued. ‘Our founder Alan Sugar has decided the time is right to move into the home computer market. We understand your company’s good at launching products.’We had a chat about how Amstrad might launch its newest gadget, and Malcolm asked me to get back to him with a proposal. I told him he could count on me.I went back to my office and very rudely and unprofessionally didn’t do anything about it. Malcolm kept chasing me, and my secretary kept saying: ‘You’ve really got to do something about this, Nick. It’s very embarrassing.’Eventually I groaned: ‘Oh God, this is awful. I’ve got no ideas and I don’t understand computers anyway. But I’d better go and apologise to him and eat humble pie.’So I got in a taxi and went back to Malcolm’s offices in Tottenham, and on the way I had one of the two brainwaves I’ve ever had in my life. What does this computer actually do, I thought. Well, it’s got colour, sound, maths, music and many other functions.The market is children aged eight to ten, who will use it to play games (there was virtually no other software for them at the time).How about we find children with names that fit the various functions, and then launch the computer in a place with a strong educational link, like a well-known school or college? When I got to Malcolm’s office, I fibbed again. ‘I’ve been thinking long and hard about your problem,’ I said, and explained my newly formed idea.Malcolm loved it — and so, it later turned out, did Alan Sugar.I didn’t meet him in person until the official launch, but as he walked past me after the presentation, he let out what I can only describe as a little grunt.Malcolm, who was beside me, whispered: ‘That’s amazing! You got a grunt.’‘Is that good?’‘Some people wait 18 months for a grunt,’ said Malcolm. ‘It’s Alan’s version of a round of applause.’          Wheel of fortune: Nick Hewer relaxing off-screen with MargaretAnd that was it. I was in. In the years that followed, I helped Alan launch all sorts of things: a word processor named Joyce after his long-suffering secretary his Amstrad PC his phenomenally successful satellite dishes. Crazy days, and fantastic fun. I sold my business and travelled all over the world working for Alan until I hit 60 in 2004.And that, I thought, was that.Alan and my partner Catherine planned a party for me at the Dorchester hotel, after which I took myself off to our house in France and started to imagine my future now I had retired.That was the February, and it was a gloomy time for me as I struggled to adjust to retirement, the psychological dimensions of which I had neglected to consider, as I will reveal next week.The future was a rather dreary and barren landscape with the odd bit of tumbleweed blowing across it. Come March, I got a call from Alan. ‘Where are you, Nick?’‘I’m in London.’‘Well, get yourself to the Dorchester for three o’clock and bring a pencil. I need to talk to you about something.’I get up there and Alan tells me about an American TV programme called The Apprentice, which features an iconic figure called Donald Trump.It’s an entertainment show, he explains, but the bedrock of it is business.The BBC has plans for a British version, says Alan, and he is keen to front it. The show’s bosses, however, have other ideas. They want the new kid, Philip Green. In a couple of minutes the show’s producer Peter Moore will be joining us, and we have to persuade him Alan is the right man for the job. No pressure, then.So, we had our tea-and-cakes meeting with Peter that grey March day and a very dreary occasion it was. At least, that is my recollection.Alan’s version is different — he swears the deal was already done. He has a very good memory (perhaps, occasionally, with a bit of ‘VAT’ on top), but my recollection is that when Peter left we agreed it hadn’t gone terribly well.My second stroke of genius (ever) was to say to Alan: ‘Look, you can’t exemplify what Trump exemplifies sitting in here in the gloom. He’s got helicopters and jets and lives in palaces, and we’re sitting here eating macaroons. It’s not what you’d call showbusiness, is it?’I suggested, instead, that we flew Peter and his team out to Alan’s place in Marbella. ‘We’ll lock them in and not let them out until the deal is done,’ I said. Which is exactly what we did.By the time we put them back on the plane at Malaga, they had their man. Just before the door closed, Peter stuck his head out of the plane, saying to Alan: ‘What about your advisers?’ Then he looked at me. ‘Nick would do.’      Prince Andrew watches play at the Duke of York Young Champions Trophy in 2015Less impressive as a royal was Prince Andrew, whom I met at a reception at St James’s Palace.As far as I can see, he works a room like this: A lackey approaches to say you will shortly be introduced to the Prince and should therefore form a small horseshoe of three or four people and look out for the discreet nod that indicates you are next in line.We knew immediately that he was homing in on our horseshoe, because we could hear him from 30 yards away — he has a sort of booming, unattractive manner about him.He huffed and puffed in the middle of our group, was obviously not the slightest bit interested in any of us, and before long was gone, which was fine by us.   IF YOU CAN MAKE BIN LIDS, YOU CAN MAKE SATELLITE DISHES!  The story of Alan Sugar’s famous satellite dishes is one of my favourites.The phone had apparently rung in Alan’s offices one day and his secretary had said: ‘I’ve got Rupert Murdoch on the phone.’Alan replied: ‘I suppose he’s somebody who says he went to school with me?’‘Actually, no,’ Frances said. ‘He’s the man who owns The Times and the Sunday Times and the News of the World.’          Rupert Murdoch told Lord Sugar about his plans to launch Sky Television, which was going to beam a footprint all over EuropeWhen Alan is focused on something there is no escape, but why should he care about Rupert Murdoch, who’d never crossed his radar? Until then, Murdoch didn’t matter to him. But that was about to change.So he went to see Murdoch, who told him about his plans to launch Sky Television, which was going to beam a footprint all over Europe.‘What’s that got to do with me?’ Alan asks.‘Well, you’re rated as the best man at mass-market electronics so I want you to make the dishes and the system units that will receive my signal and squirt it into people’s television sets.’‘How many would you want?’‘Uh, I don’t know, let’s say 100,000 pieces per month from about March?’ (It is now September 1989.)Alan goes back to the office and speaks to Bob Watkins, his long-time technical director, who is just about recovering from a near-nervous breakdown from whatever the last project was.‘Bob,’ says Alan, ‘we’re in the satellite business.’ ‘But,’ says Bob, ‘we don’t know anything about it.’Alan brushes this off. ‘That doesn’t matter. We’ll find out about it.’When Amstrad first got into the PC market, Alan and Bob’s team took the lid off a couple of PCs and peered into the back, only to discover there was nothing there — a few boards and electronic bits and the rest was empty. It was a load of hokum: make it big and charge a bigger price was the attitude.Same thing when Alan got into the satellite business.Alan and Bob got in the people who made the dishes (mainly for embassies and government installations), and asked them to quote for a small dish, about 3ft wide.The experts, like all experts, made a serious face and said it was going to be very expensive: there was the curvature of the steel to be taken into account, the delicacy of the component parts, yadda yadda yadda.‘Yeah, yeah,’ said Alan. ‘How much?’‘Somewhere in the region of £75,’ came the reply.So, they were thrown out and Alan said: ‘Bob, get in the people who make dustbin lids. They’re the same size. What’s the difference?’They came in, and were also sent on their way. Finally, the contract went to a firm who made hubcaps for cars: you get a big piece of metal, and a big press comes down and boom! There’s your dish.There is a reason this man was a multi-millionaire at the age of 33. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/25/01/4F3B873900000578-6096615-image-a-54_1535156645262.jpg","title":"Radical new approach IVF DOUBLES chance getting pregnant 62 cent say experts","story":"    Egg storage for in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Tube of eggs in cryogenic (frozen) storage, aboveWomen undergoing IVF usually have a fresh embryo transferred into the uterus within a week of the eggs being retrieved.But the IVF clinic, which is part of Cambridge University Hospitals Trust, found that waiting for the body to recover improved a woman’s chances of conceiving.Doctors say the high success rates mean that for the first time, couples can start fertility treatment knowing that it is more likely to succeed than fail.The technique – which involves implanting the first embryo at least a month after undergoing the fertility treatment – resulted in pregnancy 62 per cent of the time, compared with 41 per cent using fresh ones straight away.This is nearly double the national average rate of 36 per cent for using fresh embryos, according to figures from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.Consultant embryologist Stephen Harbottle of Cambridge IVF, who led the research, said it is the most ‘exciting’ development he has witnessed in 25 years.          Women undergoing IVF usually have a fresh embryo transferred into the uterus within a week of the eggs being retrieved‘The biggest angst with fertility treatment is that it’s always been that the treatment is more likely to fail than be successful,’ he said. ‘What we’ve been doing for years is put the best embryo into the worst environment so by being very well-meaning, we might actually have been holding back success rates for years. \u0027We can start saying to people you’ve got a better than 50 per cent chance of success in most of the age groups. Across the board, data is showing a huge increase in success rates. It’s really exciting.’Typically, a woman undergoing IVF is given follicle-stimulating hormones to encourage the production of around ten eggs in one go. These are then harvested, fertilised with sperm and left to develop as embryos before one is transferred into the uterus. Any remaining successful embryos can then be frozen for use at a later date.Doctors at the clinic noticed success rates were higher when using these frozen embryos rather than fresh ones immediately implanted.They decided to explore further the process, known as frozen embryo transfer (FET), which was already being used in America and Scandinavia.Pregnant Venezuelan women are fleeing their country to give...Hero mom of triplets who gave CPR to her first newborn while...Share this articleLast year they enrolled 147 women, aged between 24 and 45, to take part in an 18-month pilot of the ‘freeze-all’ process to see how it affected their fertility chances. As a result, 62 per cent of women became pregnant, with improved success rates for women of all ages, the researchers say.They believe the success is largely because the body is allowed to return to normal after the disruptive hormonal treatment, which could create a hostile environment for the embryo. The clinic has now received NHS approval to start offering the ‘freeze-all’ service to patients. It means patients from anywhere in the UK will be able to sign up for the treatment, which costs an additional £245 on top of the initial £2,500 for a round of IVF.          While there have been some live births, the trial is continuing, with many of the participants currently pregnantLike many other clinical commissioning groups, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough health trust stopped free IVF in its region last September.While there have been some live births, the trial is continuing, with many of the participants currently pregnant.Commenting on the Cambridge technique, Stuart Lavery, a fertility expert at Imperial College London, said: ‘I think it’s an exciting area but I want to see much more evidence before I see a change in practice.’  How it helped me become a mother           Delighted: Kerrie Suarez with EmilioKerrie Suarez’s job as a nursery nurse served as a constant reminder of what she so dearly wanted.But she was unable to have a baby because she suffered from endometriosis, which saw scar tissue build up in her fallopian tubes and stopped her eggs from being released.Mrs Suarez, 34, who lives in Cheadle, Manchester, with her husband, Francisco, also 34, tried fertility treatment. But after three IVF rounds on the NHS with fresh embryos, she still was not pregnant.For their fourth attempt the couple decided to go private. They opted for a ‘frozen cycle’ after doctors suggested the womb lining was more receptive to frozen embryos.Mrs Suarez waited for two months before an embryo was implanted and then finally found she was pregnant. She had a 6lb 12oz boy Emilio, who is now ten months. ‘I still find myself staring at him in wonder,’ she said. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/24/21/4F5E2E6A00000578-0-image-m-58_1535143564933.jpg","title":"Drivers paying 7 cars 12 months ago","story":"    Millions of drivers hitting the roads this bank holiday will have to pay £7 more to fill up their cars than they did a year agoThis equates to around £7.17 when filling up a 55-litre tank on a typical family car.Drivers of diesel cars have been hit even harder with the average price rising by just under 15p a litre – or £8.15 a tank – in the past year. S\u0026P 500 and Nasdaq close at record highs, two days after US...Taxman is now taking FIVE MINUTES to answer phones after...Share this articleThe average price is now 132.72p a litre, which is the highest level since September 2014, and up from 117.91p since the August bank holiday last year.

More than 10,000 minors to sign up since mandatory military service ended in 2011In 2017, 2,128 people under 18 joined the German army, up 11.4 percent from 2016 and accounting for 9 percent of new recruits, according to government data.With lively music and scenes showing the lives of young soldiers, the Bundeswehr\u0027s shows on YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet, have attracted more than 64 million views.In October, traffic at the Bundeswehr jobs website increased 60 percent during a six-week broadcast of \u0027Mali\u0027, a YouTube series centred on eight soldiers serving in the U.N.\u0027s peacekeeping mission in the West African country.The Bundeswehr Exclusive YouTube channel has over 330,000 followers and its latest production portrays the lives of a group of young paratroopers. The army is also active on other sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.According to a Trendence Institut survey of 20,000 school students across the country, the military is now considered Germany\u0027s third most attractive employer, behind sportswear maker Adidas and the police in first place.Overall, the army spent about 35 million euros ($40 million) on recruitment last year, more than double its spending in 2011, the year compulsory military service ended, annual parliament reports about the Bundeswehr showed.\u0027The Bundeswehr today is a volunteer army ...

Here’s why.Like all monkeys and apes, humans are social. We have an urgent desire to schmooze and an awareness that alcohol helps our cause.Friendships protect us against outside threats and internal stresses, and this has been key to our evolutionary success. Primate social groups, unlike most other animals, rely on bondedness to maintain social coherence.And for humans, this is where a shared bottle of red wine plays a powerful role. It isn’t just because alcohol causes us to lose our social inhibitions and become over-friendly with our drinking chums.Rather, the alcohol itself triggers the brain mechanism that is intimately involved in building and maintaining friendships in monkeys, apes and humans. This mechanism is the endorphin system. Popular Instagram fitness model is arrested for mowing down...Two passed out toddlers are rescued from the back of a hot...Share this articleEndorphins (the word is a contraction of ‘endogenous morphine) are neurotransmitters that are intimately involved, through their opiate-like effects, in the management of pain.That opiate-like all’s-well-with-the-world effect seems to be crucial for establishing bonded relationships that allow iniduals to trust each other.Drinking, seen in this light, is a profound activity. It enables humans to open up their deepest selves, giving another twist to the ancient saying ‘in vino veritas’ (in wine, truth).Of the many social activities that trigger the endorphin system in humans (they range from laughter to singing and dancing), the consumption of alcohol seems to be one of the most effective.At detox clinics, one increasingly common form of treatment is to dose an addict with an endorphin blocker that locks onto the brain’s endorphin receptors but is pharmacologically neutral, so you don’t get the hit when you drink. Instead, you get a mild form of cold turkey.          Alcohol triggers the brain mechanism that is intimately involved in building and maintaining friendshipsHumans have a long association with alcohol that reaches back into the mists of prehistory. Archaeologists such as Patrick McGovern from the University of Pennsylvania Museum have found residues of fermentation in clay vessels in China dating back more than 8,000 years.There is an emerging view among some archaeologists that the reason humans started cultivating grains such as wheat and barley was not to make bread (as everyone had previously assumed) but to make a gruel that could be fermented. One reason for this thinking is that primitive cereals cultivated in the Middle East during the Neolithic period, have a different gluten structure, making it more difficult to make good bread.They do, however, make a very good gruel that ferments well. If you had to choose between a tasteless, soggy flatbread and a glass of beer, well it’s a no-brainer, isn’t it?While the big innovation of the Neolithic may have been brewing rather than agriculture, the exploitation of naturally fermenting fruits may have a much longer history.Elephants in southern Africa and India have a penchant for eating fermented fruits and can become quite woozy on it.Primatologist Kim Hockings, of Exeter University, has studied west African chimpanzees that habitually steal the palm wine left fermenting in trees by local farmers. And Robert Dudley, from the University of California Berkeley, claims that we share with the apes a unique genetic mutation dating back 12 million years that allows us to break down the alcohols in over-ripe fruits.For humans, if not for elephants, fermented drinks play a central role in feasts the world over — and feasts are all about friendships. And it is probably in this respect that alcohol plays a seminal role.We need friends because they provide help when we need an extra hand, or someone to listen with a modicum of empathy to a tale of woe.          Boris Johnson shares a pint with Zac Goldsmith at Leadenhall Market in London But friendship, it turns out, has other hidden benefits.One of the biggest surprises of the last decade or so has been the torrent of publications showing that our happiness, health and susceptibility to disease — even our speed of recovery from surgery and how long we live — are all influenced by the number of friends we have.One study by Julianne Holt-Lunstad collated the results of 148 studies of heart attack patients. The aim was to determine what it was that best predicted the probability of surviving for 12 months after a first heart attack.Aside from sampling a large number of people, it was based on a hard-nosed outcome: survival or death. And the best predictor? The number and quality of friendships you had.A short way behind that was giving up smoking (no surprises there). Then, way further down in terms of impact came exercise, obesity, alcohol consumption, quality of diet and even air quality.It seems you can eat, drink and slob about as much as you want and it won’t affect your chances anything like as much as having a few good friends.Loneliness is a health threat in the western world, and the UK even has a dedicated minister to address the problem.How to solve it is a huge challenge, but encouraging people to socialise over a few beers or some wine at the village pub may be a good place to start.While the role of alcohol in sustaining the friendship networks that provide us with psychological and emotional support is crucial, the endorphins triggered by what we do with friends may have hidden benefits. They appear to tune the immune system by activating the body’s T-cells — part of the defence mechanism that gives us resistance to many common ailments.I’ve lost track of how many times I have been told by ex-military folk that they were never so ill as when they returned to civvy street. It wasn’t that they weren’t as fit as they had been in the forces it was that they kept falling ill with coughs and colds and the detritus of everyday life.When I mentioned the camaraderie of Army life, the odd pint and all that exercise on the drill square, they immediately got the point.Exercise, alcohol and friends — three great ways to trigger endorphins. Of course, like anything biological, overdo the alcohol and you’re on the downward curve before you know it. But then that’s true of everything we eat.           For humans,  a shared bottle of red wine plays a powerful roleProteins, salt, fats and sugars are all good for you, but have too much and you’ll be pitched into the diseases of civilisation — diabetes, obesity, cancers, hypertension, you name it.The same is true of alcohol. A few drinks will relax you and make you more sociable: they even seem to do you some good. But have the proverbial one too many, and you end up paying a price.This was borne out by a recent article in the British Medical Journal reporting on a study of 9,000 Whitehall civil servants whose drinking habits and health had been studied over several decades.Those who had consumed no alcohol in their 40s and 50s, along with those who had typically consumed more than the official government guideline of 14 units a week, had a significantly increased risk of dementia later in life.Those who did not drink at all had a 50 per cent greater risk of developing dementia than those who drank moderately, and the same risk applied to those who drank heavily (more than about 40 units a week).Drinking more than 60 units a week (roughly equivalent to a bottle of wine a day) doubled their risk.These results may be even more interesting than at first seems to be the case. The study didn’t look at friendship as a factor, but I am struck by the pattern.People who drink moderately tend to be social drinkers, whereas heavy drinkers ramp up their consumption because they often drink alone at home — or drink past the point of being able to engage in the kinds of conversations on which friendships are built.It may be these results actually reflect the fact that social drinking creates networks of friendships, and it is being embedded in a supportive network that protects against dementia as much as anything else.Friends engage us in conversation in ways that keep the brain ticking over, as well as providing us with endorphin-related health benefits. When we meet over a beer, we talk, laugh, tell stories, occasionally even sing and dance.All of these have been shown to trigger the endorphin system, and so help the process of social bonding as well as the processes of healing. At the University of Oxford, we recently undertook a set of studies in collaboration with the Campaign for Real Ale to look at the benefits of old-style community pubs relative to the high street bars that have come to dominate our social horizons in recent years. One component of this was a national survey of pub use.          People who drink moderately tend to be social drinkers, whereas heavy drinkers ramp up their consumption because they often drink alone at homeRather strikingly, this showed that people who had a ‘local’ that they patronised regularly had more close friends, felt happier, were more satisfied with their lives, more embedded into their local communities, and more trusting of those around them.Those who never drank did consistently worse on all these criteria, while those who frequented a local did better than regular drinkers who had no local that they visited regularly.A more detailed analysis suggested that it was the frequency of pub visits that lay at the heart of this: it seemed that those who visited the same pub more often were more engaged with, and trusting of, their local community, and as a result had more friends.In a separate study of social eating, we found that eating with others also positively affected these same outcomes, especially if this was done in the evening.When we asked what other things happened during the meal that might have produced these effects, the three things most frequently listed were laughter, reminiscences and — yes, you’ve guessed it — the consumption of alcohol, all three of which are good at triggering the endorphin system.The fact that evening meals, in this study, seemed to be more important than lunchtime meals is interesting, because there seems to be something especially magical about doing social things in the evening that enhances all these effects. Think of the very different buzz you get from going to an evening performance at the theatre compared to the matinee.This may well be a hangover that dates back 400,000 years to the time we mastered fire. Doing so allowed our early ancestors to shift all their social bonding activities to the evening, so freeing off a lot of extra time during daylight for foraging and other economically essential activities. Add a few fermenting fruits to the mix and...In the flickering light of the campfire, you can’t do much that requires keen eyesight such as sewing or making tools, but you can chat away across the flames.This is nicely illustrated by what South African San Bushmen talk about around their campfires.When anthropologist Polly Wiesner listened in on their conversations, she found daytime conversations typically consisted of boring factual topics and discussions of trading agreements with neighbours, but evening conversations were invariably about social topics or involved stories and jokes.Friendships work because they provide us with ‘a shoulder to cry on’ on that handful of occasions when our world falls apart.But friendships have to be set up ahead of need if they are to work for us, and that means investing a lot of time in them.Our studies suggest we devote 40 per cent of our available social time (and the same proportion of our emotional capital) to an inner core of about five shoulders-to-cry-on. And we devote another 20 per cent to the next ten people who are socially most important to us. In other words, about two-thirds of our total social effort is devoted to just 15 people.That is a very substantial commitment, and amounts to an average of about two hours a day. It makes it all the more necessary that what we do with them is fun, otherwise they won’t keep coming back for more.So, if you want to know the secret of a long and happy life, money is not the answer.Get rid of the takeaway in front of the telly and bin the hasty sandwich at your desk: the important thing is to take time out with people you know and talk to them over a beer or two, even a bottle of Prosecco if you really must.There’s nothing quite like a convivial evening wrapped around a pint to give you health, happiness and a sense of well-being.Robin Dunbar is Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of the British Academy.

She is not kidding.At the bottom of the hill there is, indeed, a V-shaped pink tent adorned with red fringing, complete with padded silk anatomical detail and open at both ends. I walk through the tent and — like Alice falling down the rabbit hole or Lucy walking through the wardrobe and into Narnia — enter a whole new universe.Welcome to Woman Fest, the United Kingdom’s first major female-only festival.Held in some corner of a Somerset field that is now forever green — in an ethical, feminist, fully composted way — it bills itself as a celebration of humanity, healing and hope.Over a cloudy spell in August, the sisterhood is paying £225 each (including all classes plus vegan and vegetarian meals) to gather for four days in a safe space where men, drugs and alcohol are banned.Instead, we will be getting high on the power of song and dance, or indulging ourselves in myriad alternative ersions including tarot, acupuncture, massage, drumming workshops, basket weaving, campfire debates, shamanism, womb wisdom, ancient Swedish folk music and gong baths (a form of sound therapy using the metal musical instrument).What a washout!

This ancient practice involves crouching over a pot of bubbling water enriched with herbs for about 30 minutes, roughly about the time it takes to steam a small Christmas pudding.It is supposed to be good for you, although many health professionals disapprove.There will also be yoni printing (oh God, surely not) plus various sinister sounding classes including Mothering the Moon Maiden, Sex Magic Rituals and a Shamanic Bee Smoking Ceremony. What?We’re going to be cracking out the Rizlas and smoking bees? That doesn’t sound very nice at all. Or even vegetarian.          A lady enjoys herself at Woman Fest, the United Kingdom’s first major female-only festivalOne of the 200 or so souls at the festival is PR guru and Ab Fab inspiration Lynne Franks, who lives nearby.‘Jan,’ she scolds. ‘I hope you are not going to take the mickey out of this incredible occasion? Tiana has done an amazing job. And make sure you visit the Tree Sisters.’Tiana Jacout is the founder of Woman Fest and is pictured on their website wearing a giant headdress made of stag antlers and feathers about which, Lynne, I am saying nothing.The 30-year-old creator insists that the radical participation festival is not an ‘anti-men symposium’ and, instead, sees it as an opportunity for women to congregate, support and learn from each other.‘We want to celebrate women’s creativity and potential,’ she says.Tiana trained as a five-element acupuncturist (based on Fire, Earth, Metal, Water and Wood) and an Emotional Freedom Technique practitioner, skills she used when she set up a clinic in the Calais migrant Jungle after spending a few years on an ashram.Her mother, Rikki, a veteran of the Eighties Greenham Common anti-nuclear protest, recently toured Italy with a clown workshop.On the website, Tiana writes passionately of her inspiration. ‘We have gathered since the beginning of time! We are the granddaughters of the witches you failed to burn. We are the spinsters, the crones, the women who would not be sold as cattle,’ she thunders.Crikey.All this takes place on Critchill Manor Estate, just outside Frome, where we bee-smoking, undead crones pitch our tents by the lake and admire the energy and imagination that powered this festival into being.On the left, past the tent vagina, is a chill-out area with hay bales and hammocks, next to a giant macramé tree of life symbol. To the right, by the lake, is a spa — featuring an ingenious wood-fire sauna in a cowboy wagon, plus two hot-tubs and showers.Naked women of all shapes and sizes ply their way between the tubs or skinny dip in the lake.‘Actually I’m not naked,’ one of them explains, even though she is patently wearing nothing. ‘I’m taking a wind bath.’At the entrance to the spa is the Manifestation Tree, a weeping willow where Woman Festers have tied their secret wishes on leaf-shaped pieces of yellow card.‘I wish to embrace my inner child and to support others,’ reads one message. ‘I wish to create strong sisterhood and empowerment,’ says another. ‘I wish to smash the patriarchy,’ writes another, in angry capital letters.The camp stretches up an incline in a narrow field and features a marquee called the Expressions Tent where food is served at one end — boiled eggs or almond milk porridge with pumpkin seeds for brekkie.In the opposite corner, a regular stream of women come in to kneel at a small altar, heads bowed in silent contemplation as they study what seem to be tiny missals.Pray, what deity inspires such devotion among the sisters? Only when I get closer do I see that it is a phone recharging station.Stretching up the hill are a collection of tipis and tents, including the Womyn Rising tent, the Woman’s Circle tent, the Woodland Tipi and the rather scary Red Tent.Women who are ‘on their moon’ are invited to visit the Red Tent, where I imagine they spent hours shouting: ‘Who touched my camomile teabags?’ and ‘Stop looking at me like that.’The Festers themselves come from all classes — those who cannot afford the ticket price are invited along as volunteers — and either seem to be millennials or baby boomers. Presumably those in-between are too busy raising families or smashing the glass ceiling to bother with sacred unity consciousness and the like.A lot of Festers are wearing evening gowns and face glitter, drifting through the stubble in the field like morning goddesses, visiting the toilets where they are invited to ‘take one scoop per poop’ from the sawdust bins and ‘sprinkle the stardust’ after them.One man-free bonus? All agree that these are the cleanest and most fragrant (relatively speaking) festival loos ever.One morning I join the queue at the Woodland Tipi, where the yoni steaming takes place.Aren’t you worried that many doctors say it does more harm than good, I ask a devotee?‘Well think about it,’ she says. ‘Your mouth and your yoni are at opposite ends of your spine, so it makes sense.’ It does? ‘Yes. It gives you balance. And afterwards you say to yourself, I am steamed and I am cleaned.’You do? Like an old banger leaving a car wash? I never do find out, as the yoni steaming is wildly over-subscribed and yoni mistress Lorraine can’t fit everyone into her schedule.The deep feeling of relaxation and camaraderie that being in an all-female camp engenders is a joy — it’s like being back in the Brownies, except Festers are dreaming of a new yoni instead of a new pony. Yet I do wonder if all this focus on the yoni is entirely mindful and healthy? I mean, what would we call it if a bunch of men went off into the green wilderness to contemplate their penises for a few days?‘We’d call it a golf weekend,’ says Coral from Wiltshire, who is sitting on a milking stool in the Sacred Garden.Time for more enlightenment, so I join the Fool Expression class, held by Christie Holly Tree.Twelve of us sit in a circle of cushions while she explains the concept. Something about the role of the jester in history and how it is a way to inner peace? This is hard to grasp and anyway, wasn’t the jester always a — whisper it — man?All too soon, Christie puts on some plinky-plonky music and we all have to stand up and perform, letting our inner jester out. Oh God. I wobble about like a weeble, sometimes doing a flute-playing Jethro Tull on one leg. You can’t say I’m not trying.Among my fellow Fools one woman is shaking her shoulders and making the kind of grunting noises you’d expect from a copulating mammoth. Kaftan-wearing Ollie, a plucky 71-year-old from Essex, is doing the twist.Next to her, a woman in red velvet is on all fours, barking loudly. Another woman makes kitten ears with her hands and mews.‘I was pretending to be my cat,’ she says later.There is always one, isn’t there?We have to explain what the exercise meant to us.Red Velvet says it ‘stopped the mind chatter’ in her head. One woman says she managed to ‘dance away the pain’ in her neck. Ollie says she felt for the first time in her life that ‘it was OK to be me’.I hear this simple but touching validation over and over at Woman Fest, where so many women seem to be searching for acceptance. However, after the class, I see Dances Away The Pain marching up and down outside the Expressions Tent, bellowing into her iPhone. ‘Tell him from me that I don’t give a s**t,’ she roars, proving that inner peace is elusive, even for jesters.By the camp’s fire pit I talk to Barbra from Buckinghamshire, who is seeking spiritual nourishment and support as she goes through a torrid orce. She has also just been to a jade egg workshop.Oh, tell me about it, I say, as I have signed up for one later, believing it to be some kind of crafting technique. Like marbling or tie dyeing, right?‘Wrong,’ says Barbra. Jade eggs are all about strengthening your pelvic floor, although some women also use them for sexual pleasure and others use them to connect to their grief. You don’t paint them?‘No, you put them inside you.’Inside you? ‘Yes. You choose from small, medium and large sizes, then you put them inside you and you dance around.’          Stock picture of a woman and teenager dancing in a field at duskJade eggs, love eggs, yoni eggs — call them what you will, but they seem to be big business out there on the wilder shores of alternative healing.Gwyneth Paltrow (her again) sells them on her Goop website, where health benefits such as improved sex lives and menstrual cycles are cited.Gynaecologists and doctors, however, are blunt about the eggs — do not insert under any circumstances, is the general message —but as they are freely available in outlets such as Etsy and Amazon, it seems that few are listening.Later, I drift in an out of an egg workshop in the Women’s Circle tent, where keen eggers produce their own sets of crystal or marble eggs in little pouches.Sarah, the teacher, instructs women who have had children to go for the large size, newcomers to take a medium and experts to use the small because their muscles are ‘better developed’.‘Tie a length of non-scented floss around the end loop for easy removal,’ says Sarah, as the dancing begins.Not keen to lay an egg in reverse with a bunch of total strangers, I make my excuses and leave.          A festival goer at Woman Fest holds a bowl of wholesome foodLater, I see many of the women, eggs still intacto, happily dancing around the camp fire.You know something? There is a lot of madness out there.Speaking of which, one afternoon I have a massage, which involves lying face down in a wigwam while tuning forks are pressed against my acupuncture points.‘I am using the Ohm fork on you, which resonates at the same frequency as the earth,’ says Dionne, whose practice is in Birmingham. Whatever. At least it’s an escape from talking about yonis.She strikes the first fork and presses it into my foot. Suddenly I know how Tom in Tom \u0026amp Jerry felt, after Jerry plugged his tail into an electric socket.Combined with a powerful massage I end up feeling like a gong that has been soundly beaten with a rolling pin.I shake all through lunch — no wonder, it is split pea mush and a salad with a solitary cherry tomato — then keep on trembling as we all join hands under a tree and sing a song called Mother, Hear Me Calling.          The festival takes place on Critchill Manor Estate, just outside Frome. All too soon it is time to leave and to consider what I have learned at Woman Fest.First, that Peruvian herbs, whatever they might be, are the latest in thing.Second, that in this age of #MeToo and Time’s Up, gender-specific events such as this won’t drive men and women further apart, but give us all a welcome break from each other.And finally, that even if the womb is our first brain and second heart, as someone keeps insisting, yoni-consciousness festivals such as these are really not my cup of chai. But, ladies, it was fun while it lasted. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/24/23/03C41934000003E8-6096385-Former_Tate_boss_Sir_Nicholas_Serota_above_and_other_high_profil-m-17_1535149858970.jpg","title":"Britains elite universities scrap list levels save arts","story":"    Britain\u0027s most elite universities are considering scrapping or changing their list of preferred A-level subjectsBritain\u0027s most elite universities are considering scrapping or changing their list of preferred A-level subjects following an intervention by art-world luvvies.Former Tate boss Sir Nicholas Serota and other high-profile figures have claimed the arts are being squeezed out as a result of the advice.For seven years the 24 universities of the Russell Group have published guidance on which subjects most often form part of degree requirements – and so are most useful for those who have not yet decided on a course.These are English literature, maths and further maths, biology, chemistry, physics, geography, history, languages and classics. The list of these ‘facilitating subjects’ – often seen as the most academically rigorous – states that those studying at least one of the subjects have a better chance of getting into top universities.Advocates say it has helped stop poorly advised students from taking the wrong A-levels to get into academic courses. But now leading figures in the art world have launched an attack on the list. They say it encourages schools to abandon subjects such as art, music and drama, and could harm the UK’s creative industries.

The number of private schools offering the vocational qualifications has almost doubled in three years – from 53 in 2015 to 93.BTECs were once looked down upon in some elite circles because they are more job-focused. However, a spokesman for the ISC said private schools were becoming ‘less snobbish’ and understood that BTECs were more appropriate for some career paths. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/25/01/4F3B873900000578-6096615-image-a-54_1535156645262.jpg","title":"Radical new approach IVF DOUBLES chance getting pregnant 62 cent say experts","story":"    Egg storage for in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Tube of eggs in cryogenic (frozen) storage, aboveWomen undergoing IVF usually have a fresh embryo transferred into the uterus within a week of the eggs being retrieved.But the IVF clinic, which is part of Cambridge University Hospitals Trust, found that waiting for the body to recover improved a woman’s chances of conceiving.Doctors say the high success rates mean that for the first time, couples can start fertility treatment knowing that it is more likely to succeed than fail.The technique – which involves implanting the first embryo at least a month after undergoing the fertility treatment – resulted in pregnancy 62 per cent of the time, compared with 41 per cent using fresh ones straight away.This is nearly double the national average rate of 36 per cent for using fresh embryos, according to figures from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.Consultant embryologist Stephen Harbottle of Cambridge IVF, who led the research, said it is the most ‘exciting’ development he has witnessed in 25 years.          Women undergoing IVF usually have a fresh embryo transferred into the uterus within a week of the eggs being retrieved‘The biggest angst with fertility treatment is that it’s always been that the treatment is more likely to fail than be successful,’ he said. ‘What we’ve been doing for years is put the best embryo into the worst environment so by being very well-meaning, we might actually have been holding back success rates for years. \u0027We can start saying to people you’ve got a better than 50 per cent chance of success in most of the age groups. Across the board, data is showing a huge increase in success rates. It’s really exciting.’Typically, a woman undergoing IVF is given follicle-stimulating hormones to encourage the production of around ten eggs in one go. These are then harvested, fertilised with sperm and left to develop as embryos before one is transferred into the uterus. Any remaining successful embryos can then be frozen for use at a later date.Doctors at the clinic noticed success rates were higher when using these frozen embryos rather than fresh ones immediately implanted.They decided to explore further the process, known as frozen embryo transfer (FET), which was already being used in America and Scandinavia.Pregnant Venezuelan women are fleeing their country to give...Hero mom of triplets who gave CPR to her first newborn while...Share this articleLast year they enrolled 147 women, aged between 24 and 45, to take part in an 18-month pilot of the ‘freeze-all’ process to see how it affected their fertility chances. As a result, 62 per cent of women became pregnant, with improved success rates for women of all ages, the researchers say.They believe the success is largely because the body is allowed to return to normal after the disruptive hormonal treatment, which could create a hostile environment for the embryo. The clinic has now received NHS approval to start offering the ‘freeze-all’ service to patients. It means patients from anywhere in the UK will be able to sign up for the treatment, which costs an additional £245 on top of the initial £2,500 for a round of IVF.

A year later there are 19 all over the city, with more on the way.This non-profit project aims to bring the community together by setting up book exchange boxes across Leeds, where anyone can take or leave a book for free.“It felt as though there was a tide of hope after that election,” says Franklin, adding that the boxes “feel a bit like political acts”, working against the “tide of commercialism, hate, fear, selfishness – they’re the opposite of that”.You can see the waterproofed boxes all around the city, peeking out of the trees by the roadside or boldly raised on posts in front gardens. Each one is a couple of feet tall and houses about 40 books, with the initial stock coming from donations.The project is run from a studio at the end of Franklin’s back garden, where joiner David Ayres puts each box together and illustrator Jacky Fleming decorates them. Fleming describes the boxes as: “big, solid gestures of love, sharing and hopefulness … the antithesis to the kind of politics that’s going on now.”Although some people in the community had worried about placing the boxes in less well-off areas, the boxes have hardly suffered any vandalism. According to Fleming, one of the aims of the scheme is to fight stereotypes and the view of poverty as “a personality flaw”. Instead of perpetuating preconceptions, she continued, “the most beautiful thing we can do where poverty prevails … is to do the opposite” and encourage a passion for reading.Some Little Free Libraries have been funded by inidual donors, while others are supported by local businesses. A growing number are being installed in primary school playgrounds, such as at St Philips in Middleton and Temple Learning Academy in Halton Moor.As word of the Little Free Libraries spreads, neighbourhoods are starting to want their own. Last month, resident Louise Bentley launched a crowdfunding campaign that has raised £300 towards a box for the suburb of Morley. She says she is looking forward to the benefits a Little Free Library can bring. “I think Little Free Libraries are a meeting place,” Bentley says. “A check-in point, a place to pass something special to someone new, a beautiful way to express that inherent kindness in us all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79e76dd8d42e2485960fc6b3c741c0ad8f24bc11/108_137_766_459/master/766.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05d0445659c658822737ef706d896f43","title":"procter gamble bids to trademark lol wtf and other acronyms","story":"Firm wants to brand household products to appeal to younger consumersProcter \u0026amp Gamble, the household products company, has applied to trademark acronyms common in textspeak including “LOL” and “WTF”.If successful, the terms could be used to market products such as soap, detergents and air fresheners in order to attract younger consumers.P\u0026ampG registered the trademark applications with the US Patent and Trademark Office in April.

According to the French pilot and author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry: “He who would travel happily must travel light.”But now, even a case small enough to fit an aircraft’s overhead locker does not guarantee a passenger’s happiness.From November, Ryanair will only permit cases in the cabin for those who pay a £6 priority boarding fee. Other passengers will now have to pay £8 online to check a small wheeled case into the hold. Just one small bag, to fit under the seat in front, will be freely permitted. Coming from an airline that has failed to shake a reputation for giving nothing away, the new rules have provoked angry reaction online and accusations of cynical profiteering. Ryanair, however, insists the aim is to cut delays caused by passengers scrambling to stow luggage, which have kept planes on the tarmac too long for tight airline schedules.While checked-in baggage revenues have been an important stream of income, the Irish airline has already cut the high fees it once espoused. The changes, it says, will not make money: indeed, the new £8 price for a sub-10kg checked-in suitcase may encourage some to pack lighter and avoid fees of £25 or more to put a heavier case in the hold.Edmond Rose, an aviation consultant whose past jobs include director of revenue at Virgin Atlantic, says: “There’s no doubt that when you’re charging for checked baggage it is a money raiser – because the cost of handling is an awful lot less than the prices airlines charge. And passengers have adapted their habits to match. They were encouraged to bring bags into the cabin when airlines separated out checked luggage charges in order to advertise rock-bottom headline fares.Budget airlines have spread across the world in a symbiotic relationship with the small wheeled case, whose widespread use is often dated back to the Rollaboard, invented by a pilot in 1987, in a modern aviation culture of short breaks and minimal costs. And passengers have turned the tables on the bean-counters to the point where Ryanair’s finance director last year bemoaned the sight of toddlers with wheelies, the result of passengers who weren’t “playing by the rules” and “taking the piss”.However galling that sight may have been, the bigger factor ultimately appears to be the wheelie’s threat to turnaround times of as brief as 25 minutes between flights, which are central to budget airline economics. “There’s a bit of money in it, but punctuality and quick boarding is more important, not having passengers blocking everyone else while they wrestle to make a bit of space in the overhead,” says Rose. “What’s interesting with cabin baggage is that airlines keep trying different ways to allow it or charge for it – it keeps swinging around.”The Hungarian airline Wizz initially charged for all cabin bags, before abandoning the policy last year. British Airways and Virgin have marketed some fares for hand-luggage only, rather than appear to charge extra for checking bags, but both have generous carry-on allowances. Ryanair is now abandoning a recent rule change that allowed wheeled cases to be taken at the gate and put in the aircraft hold for free.A spokesman for London Stansted airport, Ryanair’s biggest UK base, said summer shifts on the frontline had shown that something had to change. “The policy of putting cases in the hold at the boarding gate was a false economy, in terms of the efforts involved at the gate and the impact it was having on flight delays.”The baggage picture is further complicated by Ryanair’s own contracts with airports: it relaxed its more stringent clampdowns on carry-ons in 2013 to get preferential terms at Stansted, promising more passengers shopping in airport shops. Although the airline doesn’t spell it out for passengers, it will still allow those duty-free shopping bags on board as well.Last year, rival easyJet lowered charges significantly for smaller checked-in bags, weighing under 15kg. It also launched a “hands free” service, designed to encourage passengers already at the airport to check in small cases, rather than drag them through security and on to the plane, for a £5 fee. From a different angle, with typical controversy, Ryanair may well have ended up in a similar place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaab46da2a23d52d572e57cbb72c1fd3eccc24dc/0_626_3504_2104/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a472540508e1a2e65eab501a754d04a6","title":"in praise of the tram britains lost network and the future of transport","story":"The UK once had an extensive tram network, now reduced to just eight cities. Would resurrecting the historical network solve Britain’s transport woes?by  Tash Reith-Banks , Harvey Symons and  Glenn SwannBritain loves transport – it’s famously one of the UK’s favourite conversational gambits. And it’s not simply our day-to-day journeys that fascinate us a rich seam of travel-related nostalgia runs through the national consciousness.Worldwide, only the US has more museums dedicated to transport than the UK – which perhaps explains the quiet ripple of excitement with which enthusiasts greeted the latest updates to Rail Map online.Founded and maintained by transport enthusiast Matthew Bromley, the website allows readers to compare transport lines past and present, revealing just how comprehensive and integrated our transport networks were before the rise of the private vehicle.To complement its coverage of rail lines and canals, Bromley has added the UK’s tram network in all its glory, showing the dramatic reduction of service in post-war Britain – some of the most striking examples of which are shown below. “There is the simple nostalgia of something from the past that served us well but has now gone,” says John Prentice, chairman of the Tramway and Light Railway Society (TLRS). But as well as inspiring fond memories of elegant vintage rolling stock, Bromley’s website points towards a range of solutions to some modern transport problems.Eight UK cities still have tram services, mostly modern networks rather than historical lines. But many tram enthusiasts wonder if contemporary transport needs might not be best served by the solutions of the past.Trams certainly offer a number of environmental and practical benefits. More reliable than buses in terms of journey time, and usually running directly to the heart of a city, trams tend to appeal to those who would normally drive cars, with the effect of increasing public transport uptake. Not only that, but trams are fully accessible as they have level boarding – certainly not the case with many buses and trains.“The modern tram can provide a higher capacity than buses and as they run on electricity, they create no pollution at the point of use,” explains Prentice. Melbourne is even going one step further: the tram network is set to rely on solar power by 2019.“In my opinion, Britain made a huge mistake abandoning its tramway systems, and is now lagging far behind other countries who modernised and improved theirs,” says Peter Watson, a tram enthusiast who has created over 100 printable tram models as a fundraiser for the TLRS.Prentice says France is leading the way with the creation of new tramways, and praises Vienna for supplementing its traditional network with an underground metro to increase capacity.Though it’s tempting to believe that resurrecting the tram network would solve the UK’s transport woes, it is probably too late. The historical lines on Rail Map online show the huge amount of infrastructure that has been lost, and the expense of reintroducing trams – installing overhead power lines, rails, and segregating sections of street – is high.Although tram networks are almost always suggested when cities consider overhauling their transport networks, the high cost means few new networks are given the green light. Edinburgh’s new line, for example, proved both expensive and controversial, although the line is now running at a profit. Innovations such as stored power use, being trialled in Birmingham, will only be beneficial on a large scale once battery technology advances. Tram-train – which allows trams to share lines with conventional trains – offers an economical way to share infrastructure and increase capacity, although the current trial between Sheffield and Rotherham is running late and over budget.Ultimately, what Bromley’s maps reveal is that focusing on one type of transport is not the answer. “Trams should never be developed in isolation: the key is integration between different types of transport,” says Gareth Prior of British Trams Online. “Whether that be bus, train and tram, or cars with park and ride on the outskirts of towns and cities – it should all be about joined-up thinking.”Below is a selection of maps based on Rail Map Online, which compare the current and former tram networks in the UK and Eire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/234180e7b5a58efdaf9333d98ddb9820bcecbca6/716_947_4468_2680/master/4468.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74ed419120302a677f1e517aba0a3c4e","title":"uzbekistan secret underground tashkent metro in pictures","story":"After the ban on photographing the Tashkent metro in Uzbekistan was lifted this summer, Amos Chapple, RFERL’s photographer went underground to reveal the art, architecture and nuclear-blast protection in Central Asia’s oldest subway system"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3f7b7a1b11d191ab7ffc64f2bcdb1933764190/0_0_4734_2841/master/4734.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26f28f529c146400dda66324c5249b2f","title":"calm amid the concrete britains best urban green spaces","story":"From shopping centre beehives to grand hidden gardens, there’s respite from the madding crowds in Britain’s towns and citiesDalston Eastern Curve Garden, LondonThis leafy lifeline, situated slap bang in the middle of Dalston’s lively chicken shops, boutique bars and technicolor nail salons, is a vital addition to one of London’s most densely populated boroughs, where few people have access to their own garden.

Their decision should not be dismissed as merely some macabre footnote that is of interest only to historians. On the contrary, the cabinet’s\u0026nbspaction is a live political decision that is pregnant with wider meaning for the development of modern democratic Spain.While it may be physically straightforward to remove the remains from the tomb where they have lain since Franco’s death in 1975, the exhumation will in every other respect be fraught with complications and significance. Pro-Franco demonstrations at the site after Friday’s decision are likely to be repeated. Meanwhile, Spain’s minority Socialist government under Pedro Sánchez will use the decision to enhance its own authority on the left in the volatile political atmosphere that has persisted since the financial crisis of 2008-09. And Spain’s decision will cause reflection well beyond its\u0026nbspborders too. For it is a reminder, if one is needed, of the never-ending importance – and sensitivity – of historical memory in the continuing evolution of every\u0026nbspmodern nation state, including Britain.Spain’s dictator from 1939 to 1975 was buried in the basilica that forms part of the monumental, fascist-era Valley of the Fallen memorial, north of Madrid. Franco conceived the memorial, on which work began in 1940, as a “national act of atonement” following the civil war of 1936-39, which he began with a military coup in north Africa against the elected Republican government. Up to 40,000 civil war dead from both sides in the conflict are buried at the site. Many of those who worked in the memorial’s construction were political prisoners several died during the project. Although the memorial was ostensibly conceived as a shared site, it has always been seen on both sides as a nationalist shrine. Franco’s own interment there – the only person buried in the valley\u0026nbspwho did not die in the civil war – emphasised that meaning still further. Pro-Franco demonstrations still occur there, in spite of a ban.After Franco’s death the memorial and tomb were allowed to remain intact as part of the “pact of silence” on the civil war that was agreed between the parties of the right and left during the transition to democracy. But since the start of this century there has been growing pressure for change from civil society. In 2007 a Socialist government passed a\u0026nbsphistorical memory law which began to reopen issues\u0026nbspconnected to the civil war and formally condemned the Franco regime. Now comes this week’s decision to remove Franco’s remains and to begin rethinking the nature of the Valley of the Fallen as a truly shared site. As Spain’s deputy prime minister, Carmen Calvo, put it after Friday’s decision: “Democracy is not compatible with a tomb that honours the memory of\u0026nbspFranco.”This will not be easy. Spain’s rightwing parties may have long ago moved beyond Francoism, but they remain the natural political home of many who regret the modernisation of Spain, the growth of regional autonomy, the decline of the Catholic church (which backed Franco relentlessly) and attempts to rewrite the nationalist version of history. Yet there is no getting away from the facts concerning Franco. The war he launched against a democratically elected government in 1936 was intended, as a fellow general said, to eliminate “without scruple or hesitation those who do not think as we do”. The civil war killed some 200,000 combatants, with at least a further 200,000 murdered extra-judicially or after sham trials. At least 20,000 Republicans were killed after the war ended, while many others died in prisons and in slave labour.Pointlessly refighting old wars has no value. But exhuming Franco is a necessary step in the final stages of Spain’s historic journey away from authoritarian violence towards enduring democracy. Mr Sánchez is taking a political risk. But this decision is not just about bringing justice to the families of those who suffered under and because of Franco, important though that it is. It is about asserting the vibrancy of a more pluralist Spain in a more pluralist Europe. It is about the present, not the past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/626ded69ff5f19135c396f93b59f897d03d5c98a/0_85_7073_4244/master/7073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a6ba5f91eb5197782c7f35d8da90387","title":"don letts windrush stirred up some deep emotions i walked down the street practically crying","story":"The son of Jamaican immigrants, the musician and film-maker was energised by punk and the Notting Hill carnival in the 70s. But the Windrush scandal has left him deeply concerned about Britain’s futureIn the mid-70s, when Don Letts was a young man being frequently trailed through the streets by police, he would stop his car, jump up on the roof and stand, arms outstretched, Jesus-like. He leaps up in the garden of his London home, replicating the pose. “I’d go: ‘Why are you guys crucifying me?’ And I’d start taking my clothes off,” he says. “You know why I did that? To get people to start looking. The minute you’ve got an audience, the cops don’t know what to do.” The “sus law” – police powers to stop and search anyone considered to be suspicious (ie, young black men) – was in full effect and this was the most extreme of Letts’ tactics. Most of the time, he would just leave the house half an hour early “because I’d probably get stopped on the way. You know what’s really sad about it? You expected it – it was normal.”Until, he says, bouncing up on his feet, “enough was enough”. The riots at the Notting Hill carnival in 1976 were triggered by experiences such as his. “Everyone thinks it was a race riot, but it wasn’t a black-and-white thing, it was a right-and-wrong thing. The previous year, the trust between the black community and the police had broken down, primarily because of the sus law. We were pissed off and frustrated. Until that point, you just thought it was part of the deal it was the way things were.”There is that memorable photograph of Letts at the 1976 carnival, a slight, young man walking towards a line of police (it was used on the cover of the Clash compilation album Black Market Clash). The picture is a bit of a lie, he says. It looks as if he is a lone figure, about to confront the police. “What it doesn’t show is the thousands of brothers behind me about to kick off. I’m thinking: ‘Hmm, I better get out of the way.’ Don Letts ain’t stupid. I’m a lover, not a fighter.”Was he there when the riots happened? “Fucking right I was. It wasn’t about hurting anybody, it was about frustration, letting that valve off the pressure cooker. It was necessary to let people know that we were fed up with being treated like this.”If Letts – DJ, musician, film-maker, cultural fixture, raconteur – seems to have gone through life being in the right place at the right time, it’s down to his intelligence, talent and energy that he was able to make the most of every opportunity. He was the 14-year-old who sneaked off in his school uniform to a Who rehearsal and stood feet from the stage – close enough to see the whites of Keith Moon’s eyes. He befriended Bob Marley and hung out with Andy Warhol he was at the birth of punk in the UK and in the early years of hip-hop in the US. Of course, he was filming the 1976 carnival riots with his Super 8 camera. Where else would he have been?The Notting Hill carnival is on this weekend Letts has been going for close to 50 years, since his first at the age of 14. “That was about the time the Jamaican sound systems had kind of hijacked the event,” he says. “Before that, it was the music of the smaller islands that had dominated – calypso and soca from Barbados and Trinidad. Jamaican sound systems took over, which reflected the change in the cultural climate. There was the rise of the National Front, the black community was feeling a lot of pressure from the police. By the early- to mid-70s, carnival had become more of an expression of how my generation felt about being in this country. It was a really confusing concept.” The first time he went, he says, “I just remember being elated, being surrounded by a lot of black people, having a good time and not getting any trouble from the police. In those days, there were very few cops there and it was good to have two days of the year that were ours – you weren’t feeling the pressure and you could maybe light up a joint in front of the local bobby and he’d turn a blind eye.”It was never meant to be just a party, he says, going over its history, from its creation in 1959 in St Pancras town hall by the Trinidadian activist Claudia Jones as a way to provide strength and solidarity following race riots the previous year, then moving to Notting Hill in the early 60s after the murder of Kelso Cochrane, a young black man. It was political. And now? “It has undoubtedly become a massive party, but that’s true of culture around the world generally,” says Letts. “People, offered the choice between thinking or partying, they’re all partying. Why do you think the culture is so thin in the 21st century? Although they’re waking up now.” Letts likes to pace as he talks. And he talks and talks. About his kids (he has two teenage daughters and two grownup children from a previous relationship): “I’m middle-class, I guess, and the downside of that is I’ve raised some spoilt kids. They listen to shit music, they’re totally tied to their screens.” And about whether or not, at the age of 62, he feels old: “You pretend you don’t, but when I’m DJing at 4am, sometimes I’m like: ‘What am I doing?’” He works prolifically – he has a show on BBC 6 Music and recently launched a new series of his Reggae 45 podcasts, this time celebrating 50 years of the influential label Trojan Records and a history of carnival. Some of his friends have started retiring. “I don’t understand what that means.”Letts was born and raised in south London. His parents were Windrush generation immigrants from Jamaica his father worked as a bus driver and his mother was a seamstress. A month ago, Letts curated an event at Somerset House in London – “about as white a place as you can get” – to celebrate the impact of Jamaican bass culture on the UK. It also featured the artists Congo Natty, Wylie, Jazzie B and Norman Jay. All except Natty have been awarded an MBE or OBE, Letts points out. “On one hand, they’re giving the children of Windrush these awards and on the other hand they’re kicking out our parents because they have done their job and we don’t need them any more,” says Letts. When the Windrush scandal broke – people who had been living in the UK for decades began being detained or deported – Letts says it “stirred up some very deep emotions. I walked down the street practically crying, thinking about it all.”His parents came to the UK in 1955. “The way they tried to get on in society was to deny their roots, try to Anglicise themselves,” says Letts. “They tried to speak proper English, eat English food, with the promise of this multicultural dream, but it was a trick. Growing up as a teenager, I realised my parents’ generation were basically being fucked over and they weren’t happy. They were never accepted.”He grew up listening to his parents’ music – his father had a small sound system and would play it on a Sunday afternoon after church – and the Beatles, Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin that his white friends were into. “It was only through music that I really began to find any inner strength. I was being turned on by white music, but I wasn’t being told anything about who I was.” Instead, he discovered dub reggae.These were the records Letts played at the Roxy, the punk venue whose scene had grown out of Acme Attractions, the counterculture shop Letts was running in Chelsea, whose reggae sound system attracted artists such as the Clash, Patti Smith and the Sex Pistols. Punk was still so new that there weren’t many records to play, but Letts gave them reggae and they “obviously liked the basslines, they liked the fact that the music was anti-establishment and had a reportage quality. And they didn’t mind the weed. There was this cultural exchange going on.”Would punk be accused of cultural appropriation today? “Nothing comes out of a void,” he says. “The crucial thing is: is it inspiration or exploitation? If you’re fairly together, it’s easy to see the difference between the two. It’s a messy thing and it’s hard to have blanket conversations about it, but undoubtedly there are aspects where certain corporations have gone into overdrive to milk black culture.”Letts loved punk – the politics, the spirit. “I think punk rock’s greatest gift was the whole DIY ethos,” he says. “This energy was happening all around me and it was so intense that you wanted to be involved.” He picked up a camera and became the Clash’s film-maker, behind films including The Punk Rock Movie (1978) and, in 2000, the Grammy award-winning The Clash: Westway to the World. He also made videos for artists including Elvis Costello and the Pretenders. He managed the Slits and cofounded Big Audio Dynamite with the Clash’s Mick Jones, co-writing the songs, even though he couldn’t play an instrument (stickers on his keyboard told him which notes to play).At the beginning of this century, he was despairing that it felt like punk had never happened. “A lot of music today has become this kind of soundtrack to passive consumerism,” he says. “I grew up on music that kept you emotionally and politically engaged with each other – and you could party to it, too.”Where are the rebels now, he asks. “If you want to be on the red carpet, on the MTV awards show, how radical can you be? How radical can you be when you’re living with your mum until you’re 30.” London, he says, “will fucking kill you. I think young people have to get over the London thing and think about new places of creative growth. It has become an economically walled city. I do feel for them. When I was growing up, there were cracks you could operate in – squatting for instance.”But he adds, “I have noticed in the last five years a change.” Grime, the genre that comes closest to punk’s influence, with its disruption and politics, he says, “gives me hope”. Still, he is appalled by the “slow erosion” of society and rights, and the discourse that has led to everything from the rise of nationalism and “fucking Brexit”, to the Grenfell disaster to the Windrush injustices. “We need to look at our part in the whole process and why all this shit’s going on, where we have not been vigilant.”Don Letts’ Culture Clash Radio is on BBC 6 Music on Sundays at 10pm.

Significantly, climate change is happening almost twice as fast in high mountains as compared to the rest of the planet.“Whilst there are many theories as to why this is happening, we don’t fully understand what’s going on,” says Mourey. What is not disputed, though, is that many climbing routes have been drastically altered by climate change.“A 1970s climbing and mountaineering guidebook to the 100 best routes around Mont Blanc isn’t useable any more as most of the routes have changed and can’t be used,” he says.The trails to the high mountain huts around Mont Blanc which are used by climbers are becoming more dangerous too, forcing the authorities to adapt and take action.In 2012 the trail to the Conscrits hut was judged to have become too dangerous following increasing numbers of rockfalls, so a 60m Himalayan-style suspension bridge was built to make access to the hut safer.A completely new trail, including the installation of fixed ladders, has recently had to be built to the Charpoua hut following the melting of glaciers which made the previous trail too difficult and dangerous.Given Chamonix’s status as the cradle of modern mountaineering and alpine pursuits, the authorities are now making a determined effort to adapt to these changing conditions to ensure that climbing can continue.“We want to support the idea that alpinism and its values are not dead and we must keep on climbing safely,” says Claude Jacot, a Chamonix councillor and head of mountain safety for the region.But for some, the area is already becoming too dangerous.“This year we’ve deliberately reduced our programmes on Mont Blanc due to the increased rockfall caused by higher temperatures over the last few years,” says Ed Chard from trekking operator Jagged Globe.So what will happen to climbing around Chamonix in the coming years? Mourey is optimistic that the sport still has a future in the Alps, but future mountaineers will have to adapt.“You’ll still be able to climb in the future – you’ll just have to change the way you climb,” he says. “If anyone doesn’t believe that climate change exists, they should come to Chamonix to see it for themselves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad25c61c125ad0d6010a974f105741525b419799/0_0_4250_2833/master/4250.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62668952047a9c15c280eaca474a7d43 700w","title":"leggings enjoy biggest comeback sales double","story":"Increased demand follows more people incorporating fitness into their daily routines Leggings have enjoyed sporadic returns to the style spotlight since their 1980s heyday, but this year they are having their biggest comeback yet.The fashion search engine Lyst, meanwhile, says leggings are currently one of its most searched-for items worldwide, registering 430,000 searches a month for the word.The increased demand is a direct result of more people incorporating fitness into their daily routines and wanting to make a style statement while doing so, according to Vanessa Spence, the design director at Asos, where prices for the item range from £4 to £300.“The Asos customer wants a product that expresses their iniduality and our wide offer covers a variety of colours both bright and muted, and printed styles too,” Spence said. “On the activewear side, consumers have realised that being active isn’t a chore, it’s a choice and of course leggings are such an easy ‘on the move’ piece whether it be getting a coffee with friends before a class or simply relaxing at home after a run.”Trendsetters, including Kim Kardashian and Sienna Miller, have been spotted wearing them while running errands, and the high-street favourite Zara has styled many of its new-season dresses with leggings worn underneath.This season, catwalk brands are getting in on the trend. Gucci, Balenciaga and Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana are reintroducing stirrup leggings to the wardrobe vocabulary, while Richard Quinn, Marine Serre and Burberry’s styles come with attached feet, akin to tights.The resurgence of leggings feeds into a wider appetite for sport-leisure wear. Forbes reported this year that sport-leisure trainers, for example, outsold performance-oriented footwear, referring to a study released by the market research company NPD Group. Leggings, it seems, are the latest item to confirm the category’s upward trajectory.“I often get asked whether the bubble around leisure will burst any time soon, and the answer is no,” NPD’s Matt Powell said in the report. “Athleisure rules the runway, and the line between what is an athletic shoe and a casual shoe continues to blur. Brands and retailers must continue to feed this trend.” As for where the trend will head next, Lyst may have the answer: in the last month, the word “meggings”, a portmanteau for men’s leggings, has been searched for more than 500 times.

Wrong, wrong, wrong. Even a cameo from Orson Welles couldn’t lend lustre to this pointless and unfunny spoof, a dire tongue-in-cheeker that slipped past the franchise control of the producers, Eon. David Niven saunters unsexily as the retired “Sir James Bond” in this chaotic film.Oh lawdy. The Bond franchise was looking lost in the grim and joyless new “war on terror”-era, and this movie featured the worst gadget in the history of 007: an invisible car. What on earth is the point of that? You can almost see the P45 being pressed into Brosnan’s hand.This was the turn of straight actor and RSC stalwart Timothy Dalton. He was supposedly there to give Bond a hard and gritty new seriousness, but always just looked a bit humourless. This was during the Aids era of sexual restraint, too, so Bond only cops off a couple of times.Bond goes rogue, and Dalton stays dull. This one is notable for the young Benicio del Toro as a humble henchman. After this, legal copyright rows caused a six-year production hiatus during which Dalton quit.You can hear a whistling and a crackling in the air as Roger Moore begins to tune out. The stunts hold up, but Moore is on the exit ramp and his flaccid relationship with 24-year-old Carole Bouquet is a deathly embarrassment.The title is what Connery’s agent should have shouted at him when he was offered the comeback: (“Never”! Say “Never”! Again!) Connery lumbers back for the remake of Thunderball that no one wanted or needed. He was never a six-pack guy at the best of times, but he’s out of condition here. One to forget.Much mocked at the time, this film wasn’t as bad as that – despite the silliest title in the series’ history. Craig is always watchable and Mathieu Amalric is a very eccentric oddball villain.Not bad, but some of the fizz has gone. In this film, the distinction between villain and henchman seems to collapse with three bad guys: Robert Carlyle, Robbie Coltrane and, erm, Goldie, who was very big in those days.Was it a Bondaissance? A Brosnanaissance? Whatever. Stylish yet assertive smoothie Pierce Brosnan had already made an impression in the TV caper Remington Steele. He took to Bond like a duck to water: virile, cool, nice suits. Judi Dench made her debut as M. Bond was back!Quite unexpectedly, Moore pulled it back a bit for his last hurrah. (It was also, sadly, the last hurrah for Lois Maxwell’s Miss Moneypenny.) Christopher Walken was always destined to play a Bond villain and it came to pass in this film, as the evil electronics mogul Max Zorin. A good note for Moore to bow out on.A whopping, megabudget Bond in its day, clearly influenced by the Star Wars-led sci-fi revival. It is all about the theft of a space shuttle, but this excursion into space can’t conceal the fact that Moore is looking a bit jaded.George Lazenby’s sole appearance wasn’t a bad Bond. Had he done more, Lazenby might have become a favourite. Diana Rigg played the woman who shows 007 is no commitmentphobe. They marry, before gunfire poignantly restores Bond’s eternal singledom.Uh-oh. Connery was tempted back to the role with a big pay packet, now looking craggier and toupeed. Ernst Blofeld, boringly played by Charles Gray, wants to use diamonds to focus his space laser. Bond girl Tiffany Case was played by Jill St John, whose real-life boyfriend, Henry Kissinger, would have been better as the villain.It took a king from Titanic at the box office, but this is a good, underrated Bond: one of the very few films (or plays or books) to satirise Rupert Murdoch and his Chinese expansionist plans – a rather taboo subject in 90s media. Jonathan Pryce has great fun with the role of the villainous mogul.Outrageously daft, but silly and fun. Roger Moore wears a gorilla costume.This has a well-loved Bond song, Carly Simon’s Nobody Does It Better. It also introduced us to the exotic henchman Jaws. The action opens with that staggering skiing-off-a-cliff stunt, just after Moore is seen supposedly skiing in front of an obvious back projection.Despite iffy reviews at the time, this has one of the very best villains, wonderfully played by Christopher Lee: Scaramanga, he of the creepy third nipple. It is a preposterous 70s fuel-crisis drama about a solar energy device. There’s some funky martial arts, too.An excellent, intelligent Bond which shrewdly expanded the role of Judi Dench’s M, developed her relationship with 007 and created a plausible, sympathetic backstory for him. Javier Bardem got his teeth into the villain role.And so began the reign of Roger Moore, tacitly conceding the campness that many saw as unavoidable for Bond. Moore was witty, sprightly and a mature 46 when he took over (Connery had started at 32.) This movie has a great song from Paul McCartney and Wings.The evil organisation Spectre had its first appearance in Fleming’s Thunderball novel, but we were used to it by now, this being the fourth outing for 007 on the big screen. Good stuff here, but the franchise faltered a bit, with long underwater sequences.Boom! Craig and director Sam Mendes bring off an absolutely storming 007 extravaganza, kicking off with a head-banging action sequence in Mexico City. Léa Seydoux has a Veronica Lake-type sultriness and Ben Whishaw almost steals the show as the geeky Q.Daniel Craig had to face a lot of internet bickering when he was cast, but he blew everyone away with a performance that was just right: cool, cruel, ruthless, yet sardonic. It was great at the time and looks even better now. One of the best Bonds.Sean Connery’s first outing in the Bond role. It gave us the gun-barrel titles and the Monty Norman theme. There was Ursula Andress in the bikini and the exotic Johnny Foreigner villain with an outrageous island lair.Weirdly ungadgety and downbeat. Connery searches his hotel room for bugs for what seems like 10 minutes, with the theme music playing deafeningly. There’s a great train fight with Robert Shaw’s Red Grant.“You eckshpect me to talk?” “No, Mr Bond, I expect you to DIE!” This introduced us to Bond’s Aston Martin DB5 and the weird spectacle of Shirley Eaton suffocating in gold. It established the convention whereby the villain leaves 007 time to escape some elaborate automated death.This great action movie put Connery’s Bond right back on top and introduced us to the Nehru-suit-wearing, cat-stroking master criminal Spectre chief, Blofeld, played by Donald Pleasence. Connery announced his intention to quit after this. Perhaps he knew it could never be this good again?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca8eaa87648c2cab5430f2a7a5fe6a258bc1af3f/0_153_8510_5107/master/8510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a951d3c09f75673a83ec958c54fdd8ba","title":"anna jones sweetcorn recipes","story":"As cobs come into season, enjoy the kernels charred with pickled chilli and herbs, or blend them into a velvety soupI overdosed on sweetcorn as a kid. Fresh corn was a rarity, though more often it was frozen half-cobs or Green Giant eaten from the tin. Like many markers of my childhood and teenage years, from wearing the petrol blue of my school uniform to drinking Malibu and Coke, I turned my back on sweetcorn. For years I couldn’t see its culinary merit, but I was missing out. Every year late in the summer, when papery wrapped cobs are four for £1, I make up for it. Corn comes at a time that’s half summer, half autumn, and these recipes bridge those seasons.In a chowder, corn is usually paired with potatoes to add creaminess and body. I use cauliflower here instead: it suits the season, as this soup is a little lighter than the potato version. It also makes use of the often wasted cauliflower leaves, which I crisp up in a pan as I would crispy kale. The basil, spring onion, green chilli and peanut topping is what makes it sing. You could use other nuts, and coriander would work in place of basil, if you like.Olive oil1 leek, trimmed and finely slicedSalt and black pepper4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced1 pinch dried red chilli350g cauliflower (about ½ a medium one), cut into small florets, leaves shredded3 corn on the cob, kernels sliced off the husk (about 650g kernels)1 x 400ml can coconut milk1 tsp veg stock powder or ½ a cube Juice of ½ lemonHeat two tablespoons of olive oil in a large soup pan over a medium-high heat. Add the leeks and a good pinch of salt and cook for 10 minutes, until soft and sweet.Add the garlic and dried chilli, cook for two minutes, then add the cauliflower florets, keeping the leaves for later. Add all but a handful of the corn, a good pinch of salt, the coconut milk, stock cube and one and a half tins of water, then bring to a boil and simmer for about 20 minutes. It’s ready when the cauliflower is soft throughout and the soup has thickened a little. Blend with a hand blender until it’s about half liquidised. Add a little lemon juice and a good grind of black pepper. Taste, adding more salt, pepper and lemon as needed.Heat a frying pan over a medium heat, add a little oil and then the remaining corn, the chopped chilli and spring onions, along with the shredded cauliflower leaves. Cook until the corn is charred and the leaves wilted to a deeper green. Serve on top of the soup with the herbs torn over and a scattering of peanuts.I use one of my new favourite ingredients here: pickled chillies, which add an instant pop of heat, acidity and sweetness: a great foil for the smoky corn. I buy the jarred spicy Pepperdew ones from the supermarket, or make them myself. To make your own, heat 100ml white-wine vinegar with a tablespoon of sugar until dissolved and add four sliced chillies. Leave to pickle in the liquid for at least an hour. 2 small shallots, peeled and finely slicedJuice of 2 limesSalt Extra-virgin olive oil4 corn on the cob, kernels sliced off the husk (about 800g kernels)4 pickled red chillies (shop bought, or make your own – see introduction to recipe)4 tbsp Greek yoghurt (optional)1 large bunch coriander leavesA good grating of parmesan cheese (I use a vegetarian one, optional)Put the shallots into a small bowl, squeeze over the lime juice, add a pinch of salt and scrunch a few times with your hands.Heat about one tablespoon of oil in your largest frying pan on a medium-high heat. Add the corn kernels and a good pinch of salt then cook, undisturbed, until well charred underneath – this will take about three minutes. Toss and cook again until the corn is charred all over – another three or four minutes.Once the shallots have sat for a little while, add the pickled chillies, three tablespoons of olive oil and the yoghurt, if using. Season and mix.Put the charred corn in a large bowl with half the coriander, pour over the dressing and toss together, adding more salt if needed. Finish with the rest of the coriander and, if you are using it, the parmesan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6300fbf8ce0324581754c363f63f77d37fa2002/0_214_4615_2769/master/4615.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13b64489504390a48d9145b64c056d5f","title":"marco silva bournemouth everton","story":"Goodison Park is a happier place after the arrival of Marco Silva who wants his side to offer a more attacking threat this seasonIt was one home win, nothing more, but Goodison Park embraced the immediate signs of change under Marco Silva last weekend. None were more welcome than the new Everton manager’s rejection of the style that came before him.With the notable exception of the £40m summer signing Richarlison, Everton beat Southampton with a team that would have featured under Sam Allardyce last season. To be more precise, it was a team featuring two players signed by Allardyce, five by Ronald Koeman, one by Roberto Martínez and two by David Moyes.It was a team coached in the basics of survival last season by Silva’s predecessor, who insisted throughout his brief Everton tenure that positive change depended on better recruitment. Had the new arrivals Yerry Mina, Lucas Digne and André Gomes been fit to face Mark Hughes’s side, or Bernard and Kurt Zouma match-fit, Everton may well have been unrecognisable from last season for the home debut of the Portuguese coach. That they were unrecognisable, in approach if not personnel, reflected the meticulous attention to detail, the hard graft and the psychological work that Silva has undertaken since his arrival. And the players’ willingness to buy into it.A greater intensity and commitment to attack in numbers have been evident throughout Silva’s opening two matches, even when Everton were reduced to 10 men after 40 minutes on the opening day at Wolverhampton Wanderers. More subtle changes have also had an impact, however. Morgan Schneiderlin was booed on to the pitch by his own fans at Goodison last season and considered a fresh start this summer. Silva convinced him otherwise, stressing the midfielder’s importance, and it is testament to Schneiderlin’s response that his absence at Bournemouth through injury is a setback. “He has started very well for us,” the manager said. “He needed to get his confidence back.”The same applied to Gylfi Sigurdsson following a difficult first season as Everton’s £45m record signing when regularly played out of position on the left. Silva said: “I was clear with him like I was with all of them. We show them what we expect, what his role will be. I told him I believe in him and his quality and then it was up to him to prove his quality and that he deserved a role in the XI. He started pre-season later because of the World Cup but he is giving everything and prepares his mind and body every day to play with high intensity.Sigurdsson and Schneiderlin were involved in the free-kick that enabled Theo Walcott to open the scoring against Southampton, a sharp routine that Silva had his players practising the day before. Another departure. Allardyce’s reputation may include well-drilled set pieces but Everton scored only six goals from that source last season. Only Brighton and Huddersfield scored fewer. Bournemouth scored 16, the most in the Premier League. Their recent contrast with Everton extends beyond managerial stability.“Details make the difference in football today,” Silva said. “It is part of our process. Every week we work really hard on that, in our defensive and offensive set pieces, and in our routines as well. When something happens like in the Southampton game, and when you spot something and our players can transfer it from the training ground into the match situation, then it is very important for us.“Bournemouth are good at set pieces but it is something we are working on from the first day, not just this week. Often in football a game is really balanced and one small detail will make the difference between winning and losing. We try to find the detail that makes the difference for us.” Everton hope to say the same about Silva."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a106f6a9d929064e54b8c8d8a8e5e6ef4faad49/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31ebb0d58760d8c70513a2af95b1d435","title":"mourinho vs the world and a book writers special football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson and Michael Calvin to discuss Liverpool’s perfect start, José Mourinho’s issues with everyone, books, plane banner protests and the joy of chancing across a game in the parkRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Michael talks to us about the characters, stories and issues he uncovers and exposes in order to gain a deeper understanding of how the football industry affects the lives of those who are desperate to succeed in it. In part three, we look forward to a handful of this weekend’s Premier League games. Back on Monday! PS: we’re doing a live show in Manchester on 5 September as part of the Football Writers’ Festival. Tickets and all other information here! PPS: we’re heading to Oslo on 19 September.

It forces you to look closer, hear better. We are a few minutes into a tour of the Kenans’ Hollywood home when London-born director Gil Kenan stops. “Who’s barking? It’s not our guys,” he says, referring to their two dogs. “That’s not usual,” adds his wife, artist Eliza Kenan. “There are a lot of coyotes in the hills right now.”We are standing in their dimly lit bedroom in Los Angeles’ Bronson Canyon, not far below the Hollywood sign and from where Hollywood ends. It’s a warm evening, and while the rest of the city is reaching for the last of the day’s rays, we’re shaded by hills. The house was built upside down, with the bedrooms below the living area. “It’s cave-like, and that works for us,” Eliza says.Situated on a corner, the house is ship-like from the outside, with an imposing curved, grey facade, smallish windows and a flat roof. It was built in 1937, in the early days of Tinseltown, by Hungarian émigré Joseph Babolnay, for himself and his wife. Babolnay was an interiors architect who worked on the Pantages Theatre, an art deco Los Angeles landmark. “There are pieces of wood used around the house that look like they were taken from sets,” Eliza says.Today it’s home to the Kenans and their 10-year-old daughter, Una. Eliza has a background in architecture, and describes how their home mixes the industrial lines of streamline moderne design on the exterior with an art deco warmth in the interior. The couple’s bedroom, like much of the house, is hand-decorated with thin panels of Philippine Lauan wood. In a section on the ceiling, original accent lights peep through it on to artwork and a pile of folded quilts – some collected, some made by Eliza. “We have a problem with piles,” she says, referring also to the books on their bedsides.Although there are three main levels (basement, bedrooms, living area), every room is offset by a few steps this layout gives you a sense of exploration, reinforced by hidden nooks. The Kenans have made a curved concrete staircase a place to linger, by painting the walls a charcoal grey and adding a gallery of images, including pieces made by friends, oil paintings from junk shops and travels, and a framed copy of their wedding invitation.The pair met through a friend in 2003 and subsequently worked together on films, Gil as director and Eliza in the art department. First came Monster House, a children’s comedy-horror animation about an anthropomorphic house, followed by adventure film City Of Ember, set underground. “Our space inspires both of us,” Gil says. “We’re emotionally connected to where we live, and it affects how we work.”When the couple first viewed the house in 2004, what they saw when they got to the top of the staircase persuaded them to buy it: a large mural handpainted on hessian across the interior curved wall of the lounge, telling the story of Wagner’s The Ring cycle. “We turned right and lost our breath,” Gil says. “It wasn’t on any of the listing pictures. And we were so excited, because it’s classic Hollywood style but also uses animation language.”Through research and information handed down with the house, the couple learned that in exchange for room and board from the Babolnays, the mural was painted in 1941 by a young artist called John DeCuir. DeCuir went on to win Academy Awards for production design on The King And I, Cleopatra and Hello, Dolly! The Kenans believe the mural was a gift from Balbonay to his wife, Olive, who was a music lover and teacher (they found her 1937 teaching log book tucked in a convertible desk). “We’re so grateful no one’s ever stuccoed or painted over it,” Gil says. “We partially feel like we’re caretakers for the house now.”The living area is filled with things the family have created. The wall adjacent to the mural is covered by a bookshelf Eliza handmade in the garage. “We needed that because our wedding list was all books,” Gil says. Their approaches to belongings differ: while Eliza says they need to get rid of some books, Gil says they just need to find more space.Running under the mural is built-in seating the couple made together, which holds records and magazines. Perched atop is a cast of Kathleen Turner’s hand that was used in Monster House. Further along sit three sculptures made by Eliza of masonry bricks wrapped in quilt batting and covered in bright linens and silks (sold at days-la). And on a vintage velvet sofa from eBay is a heart-shaped cushion that Eliza helped Una embroider when she was five, saying, LOVE UNA.Turning left at the top of the stairs, you’re in the dining room. Over a table found on Craigslist is a painting by Los Angeles outsider artist Blitzstein. Last year, the couple wanted to continue the use of primary and secondary colours through the room, and reupholstered vintage dining chairs in red, green, blue and orange to match it. Four of the chairs sit around the table, the other two in the lounge. And everywhere there are more piles, stacks and collections.“Every little object has meaning to us,” Eliza says. “Even things like pine cones that friends have given us have become treasures.” A shelf at the top of the stairs displays carefully arranged shells, stones and intricate metal trinkets. “I think if a burglar were to come in here they would just be very confused.”Interiors style? Eliza: Personal and layered over time.What book’s on your bedside? Eliza: Many, but always John Berger’s Ways Of Seeing.What would we never find in your house? Gil: Meat.Best thing about the neighbourhood? Eliza: Living in between hours of empty trails and Hollywood, with its chaos and craziness.Favourite design feature of the house? Gil: The ship theme and the curves.Biggest extravagance? Gil: After buying the house, a Vitamix.Pet interior hate? Eliza: Hiring a designer to buy tchotchkes for you.Most treasured possession? Gil: The mural and the library.What are you saving up for? Eliza: To replace the 90s bathroom.Last house guest? Eliza: A group of women artists I meet with once a month.• Commenting on this piece?

From the stunning coastlines of Crete, to the lively festivals of Thessaloniki and the sacred sites of Delphi, the country combines beautiful landscapes with rich mythology and literature. Go on a sunset wine tour beside the bright-blue seas and domes of Santorini, believed to have been the home of the mythical land of Atlantis. Or visit Delos, where Apollo, the god of poetry, truth and prophecy, is said to have been born. Travel to one of the world’s largest natural harbours in Ithaca and you’ll see why Odysseus is intent on returning here in Homer’s Odyssey. Literature is inescapable in Greece. Athens offers its own tour of the spots where writers from all over the world once spent their time keen cyclists can take a three-hour bike tour around historic Athens and Plaka. Families with teens can be led around the city by a street-art expert, exploring the graffiti and urban art of a thriving creative scene. And if it’s great food you’re after, why limit yourself to eating when you can learn how to make it too? Join one of the city’s cooking lessons designed to give tourists a chance to recreate seven traditional Greek dishes, before heading home with a recipe book.If you’re in the market for a lazy holiday of sun, sand and sea, Crete could be the place for you. With its secluded bays and pink-sand beaches, Greece’s largest island is stunning and hospitable. Elounda is perhaps the fanciest part – a good spot if you’ve got a bit of cash to spend, or for the honeymooners. Alternatively, you could take the heart-stopping drive through narrow roads on steep cliffs to Stefanou Beach, an incredible cove of turquoise water. Elafonisi Beach is the place for pastel-pink sand. It is near a national park where tourists are known to come and do a five-hour hike through the gorge. Nature lovers might also enjoy Pátmos, designated as the “Holy Island” of Greece. Its settlement, Chorá, is a world heritage site, where white houses sparkle under the Aegean sun between historical streets leading from the island’s port, Skála, to the famous monastery. This is where John the Apostle wrote the Book of Revelation, having been banished to Pátmos by the Roman authorities. Ultimately, Greece’s extraordinary literary legacy is evident almost everywhere you look. Whether you’re exploring the inner cities or taking time out on the beach, a holiday in Greece is a great chance to familiarise yourself with the abundance of literature written about this ancient, mythical and beautiful country. And you might want to start with any number of the audiobooks listed below, perfect for listeners heading there this summer.The Magus by John Fowles, NaxosNicholas Urfe is a young Brit teaching English on a fictional Greek island, based on Spetses. Bored and consumed by his loneliness, he stumbles on to a wealthy estate and its Greek owner, Maurice Conchis, a man who may have collaborated with the Nazis. The two develop a friendship, and Nicholas is drawn into Conchis’s mysterious ways and psychological games, becoming a performer in re-enactments of the Nazi occupation and obscene parodies of Greek mythology. This is a chilling thriller, as well as a postmodern classic, in which the narrator, Nicholas, grows unsure of what is real. Many of its settings exist, however. The Lord Byron School, where Nicholas teaches, is the Anargyrios and Korgialenios School of Spetses, and Villa Bourani is a private house on the south side of the island, overlooking a popular public beach.The Names by Don DeLillo, MacmillanDeLillo knows how to write a dense and elusive novel. And he doesn’t miss the mark in this tale about the mythological world. The characters are bizarre, yet well realised, and the author uses their story to look at family loss and language. It’s classic DeLillo, in so far as all the players are smart and eloquent, including the children, and it is stylish throughout – much more than just your average exotic thriller. Set in Athens, this is a story that moves away from conventional plot to focus on politics, culture, religion and mythology.Murder in Mykonos by Jeffrey Siger, HachetteWhen a backpacker goes missing on the island of Mykonos, no one is sure if it is her body that is found in the ancient church. Andreas Kaldis, the new chief of police, recently arrived from Athens, is faced with an island of locals who are used to doing things their own way. The case reminds him, and veteran homicide investigator Tassos Stamatos, of the ritualistic murders of a few years ago, but the suspect has since killed himself. So who could the killer be? The book reveals its author’s intimate knowledge of Mykonos, with very visual descriptions and lots of information about the historic churches. Perhaps it’s no surprise this was a bestseller in Greece.Exit West by Mohsin Hamid, PenguinIn the newest novel by the author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist and How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia, Hamid tells a story about migration, in which the refugee journey happens through a portal. While living in an unnamed country taken over by war, Nadia and Saeed hear of “doors that could take you elsewhere, often to places far away”. The couple pass through a portal and find that they are on the Greek island of Mykonos, in a refugee camp. Here, “everyone was foreign, and so, in a sense, no one was”. Exit West is a timely tale about the global refugee crisis, much of which Greece has witnessed first hand. This modern history of the country is just as compelling as its mythology.Captain Corelli’s Mandolin by Louis de Bernières, AudibleSet on the Greek island of Kefalonia, the novel follows Antonio Corelli, an Italian army captain who comes to the island in the early days of the second world war. Corelli begins a love affair with Pelagia, the daughter of local doctor Iannis. Their relationship is complicated, as is to be expected in wartime, and atrocities mount around them, in both their personal lives and the life of the island itself. This is a love story and a war story – a tale of an island that is occupied first by the Italians, then the Germans. The characters are gloriously rendered and Captain Corelli’s Mandolin uses its magical setting to tell a now-famous story about romance and courage.Shirley Valentine by Willy Russell, Laughing StockYou’ve probably seen the film, adapted from the play of the same name. Shirley is a lonely middle-aged Liverpudlian woman in a loveless marriage. When her friend offers to take her on holiday to Greece, she packs her bags and heads for the sun. The gorgeous island of Mykonos is a strong attraction for both tourists and, seemingly, many of the writers who go there. And it’s the same for Shirley, who rediscovers herself here, along with the happiness she’s been longing for. Hers is a story of finding self-confidence, and recognising it’s never too late to start again.Zorba the Greek by Nikos Kazantzakis, Recorded BooksMaybe you’ve seen the film too? Written by Cretan Kazantzakis, the novel tells the story of a Greek intellectual who befriends working man Alexis Zorba. Zorba is a larger than life and unpredictable, unlike the narrator, who is modest and reserved. The two become friends, and the passion in Zorba’s character reminds both narrator and reader of the joys of living. Set in Crete, the tale captures the island’s passionate spirit – full of its smells, tastes and wines.The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller, IsisThis is The Iliad skilfully told from another perspective. Writing from the point of view of Achilles’s best friend, Patroclus, Madeline Miller convincingly reimagines the relationship as a romance, casting a different light on the Trojan War. Achilles is given a human touch. He is gentle and capable of love. It’s a new side to an ancient story and it’s super smart. The men are not positioned as brothers in arms, but as the soul mates that Homer hints they might be. Greece’s wealth of mythological and classical literature is complemented by this masterful modern interpretation.My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell, AudibleThis autobiographical work tells the story of British zookeeper, conservationist and TV presenter Gerald Durrell’s childhood on the Greek island of Corfu, where he discovered his interest in the natural world. Home-schooled during this period, Durrell became friends with a Greek doctor, Theodore Stephanides, who acted as a mentor to the boy and kindled his fascination with local fauna. The book is as much about the author’s family experiences as it is about Corfu. “It was originally intended to be a mildly nostalgic account of the natural history of the island,” wrote Durrell, “but I made a grave mistake by introducing my family into the book in the first few pages.” My Family and Other Animals is as charming as it is full of sunny olive groves and cypress trees, and all the more enjoyable for it.Mythos by Stephen Fry, PenguinAncient Greek literature has inspired creators from Shakespeare to Walt Disney. The Greek myths are told to you here by the ever-soothing voice of Stephen Fry, who takes you from Zeus to Athena with his typical humour. The Greek gods of the past become relatable, as pop culture, modern literature and music are woven into their stories. It is joyfully informal, yet full of the literary legacy threaded through so much of the tapestry of contemporary Greece.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

But his solo tour has been a place for fans – and him – to process their griefThe last time Mike Shinoda played Reading and Leeds festival it was 2003 – circa Von Dutch caps, wallet chains and buzz cut-era Britney ­– and his band, nu-metal titans Linkin Park, were headlining. “I remember the show pretty distinctly,” he says, “because it was the most rugged-looking fest I’d ever seen. Back then, being from the States, I thought music festivals were all like Lollapalooza – you go for the day, and then you go home. This was totally different, real down and dirty. There were tents everywhere, everything’s muddy, and the fans were just filthy and stinky and having the best time.”This weekend, after a lengthy absence, Shinoda will return to the main stage of this loamy and hallowed institution to play songs from his recently released solo debut, Post Traumatic. The sets will be his first UK dates since the suicide of his friend and Linkin Park co-frontman, Chester Bennington, last July. That loss is writ large on Post Traumatic, a moody, articulate work of minor-key electronica. Does it get easier to play these songs live? “Yeah, it does, actually. Part of it might be the repetition, but part of it is definitely the crowd response.”Following a short string of solo US dates, Shinoda took Post Traumatic on a whistle-stop tour of Asia, passing through China, Japan, Korea and Singapore, from where he speaks to me. “Each night we’ve been creating this forum for people to get together. I think mostly its a fun show its upbeat and enjoyable.” There are moments of tribute the fan singalong to Bennington’s part on Linkin Park’s In the End is always a bittersweet part of the set, for example, but one Shinoda has found himself looking forward to. Striking a balance between reflective and celebratory is important to him. “I wouldn’t want to go to a concert that was a downer, so I don’t want to play a concert that’s a downer.”Shinoda is evidently invested in honouring the grief of Linkin Park fans, diligently using his solo tour to offer a space for that. Even so, the strength of their feeling can still surprise him. A few nights ago in Beijing, the audience staged a post-concert vigil that went on for 40 minutes. Shinoda had long since left the venue, on strict instructions from the roadblock-weary promoter. But he got updates.Post-gig Twitter searches have helped him gauge the fan response. While he’s committed to supporting his fans, this is as much about his process as theirs. “Different people deal in different ways. My coping style is staying in motion, through music and art. Plus I’m out on the road with crew members who were with me and Chester for many years, so I’m around family, people who get it.”If there’s time after his Reading \u0026amp Leeds sets, Shinoda is hoping to see Dua Lipa (“I haven’t managed to catch her live yet”) and this year’s crowd-iding headliner, Kendrick Lamar. The furore that followed the rapper’s booking is trifling, says Shenoda. “If I saw him on like, a Hellfest bill or something, that might be a little weird,” he laughs. “But Kendrick is a unicorn. He’s not your typical rap artist. Every time I’ve seen him live it’s different – it’s poetry, it’s jazz, it’s rock, it’s rap. It’s everything.”After all, rap and rock are longtime bedfellows, something Shinoda knows more than most. He has made a career mining that intersection, from the diamond-certified emo swagger of Hybrid Theory to his hip-hop side project Fort Minor. Even in unabashed pop mode, as Linkin Park were on 2017’s One More Light – the group’s final studio album with Bennington – they made a space for MCs American (Pusha T) and British (Stormzy) alike."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62e324b11ccc6209e2c9dea41cd1befab967f8e9/1_13_1591_954/master/1591.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9ce78b994a14a49237cc68acd84b4a3","title":"why kanye west and nicki minaj are hooked on tampering with their finished albums","story":"In the age of streaming, an artist can endlessly tweak their masterpieces – but where does it end?Until recently, Minaj would have had no option but to grumble to herself, joining the many artists, from Radiohead to Lorde, who loathe sections of their back catalogue. But now, she can re-record parts she doesn’t like and change the files on Spotify. Indeed, she has already added another song, FEFE, to the record, noting that “because of streaming, we can update the albums”. In fact, if you downloaded Queen, Kanye West’s The Life of Pablo and Travis Scott’s Astroworld the day they came out then, well, first of all you’re a very strange person who still pays to get MP3s, but also you’ll have outdated versions of those records.Kanye was the first major artist to publicly own the fact that he was releasing an unfinished record, with his label Def Jam announcing, on the day The Life of Pablo came out, that “in the months to come, Kanye will release new updates, new versions, and new iterations of the album”. They called this “an innovative, continuous process the album will be a living, evolving art project”, which is basically label-speak for: “We have literally no idea what Kanye might do, no one here even has his mobile number.”In the months that followed, Kanye put Vic Mensa and Sia’s parts back on Wolves after previously removing them, and added the song Saint Pablo. Kanye appears to have encouraged his proteges to take a similar attitude to finality. Teyana Taylor, whose record was executive-produced by West, briefly floated the idea of releasing an updated version of it once the samples had been cleared. Travis Scott, also on West’s label, followed a similar path after fans complained that Astroworld track Yosemite was badly mixed.Why stop there? There are a couple of records I would love to tweak, with or without the artist’s consent. I’d start by making a version of Rita Ora’s Your Song that comes up with a better rhyme for “sad songs” than “mad songs”, then I’d set about taking all the skits off every hip-hop record ever.Some purists might argue that records are windows into a particular point in time and artists should leave them alone as a record of that particular moment, but then those are probably the same people who will spend £50 on a deluxe version of a Peter Gabriel album, remastered using technology unavailable at the time it was recorded, to play on their fancy soundsystems. So, who are the real philistines?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d78cde90d64924b7c02f47d8ff735d59334e5d/1229_489_2241_1345/master/2241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d09c682538831c11d91e4b8539b03a58","title":"the only way to end the class divide the case for abolishing private schools","story":"The continuing gap between state and private education is reinforcing privilege and harming the prospects of another generation. The only solution is integration. By  Melissa BennUnlikely as it might sound, one of the most electric political meetings I have ever attended was a lecture on the Finnish educational system given by Pasi Sahlberg, the Finnish educator and author, in London in the spring of 2012. Sahlberg, who was speaking to a packed committee room 14 of the House of Commons – the most magnificent of a run of grand meeting rooms that directly overlook the Thames – has a rather laconic manner of delivery. However, in this particular instance, his flat speaking style proved the perfect vehicle for an unexpectedly radical message.Sahlberg described how Finnish education had evolved, in the postwar period, from a steeply hierarchical one, rather like our own, made up of private, selective and less-well regarded “local” schools, to become a system in which every child attends the “common school”. The long march to educational reform was partly initiated to strengthen the Finnish nation after the second world war, and to defend it against Russian incursions in particular.Finland’s politicians and educational figures recognised that a profoundly unequal education system did not simply reproduce inequality down the generations, but weakened the fabric of the nation itself. Following a long period of discussion – which drew in figures from the political right and left, educators and academics – Finland abolished its fee-paying schools and instituted a nationwide comprehensive system from the early 1970s onwards. Not only did such reforms lead to the closing of the attainment gap between the richest and poorest students, it also turned Finland into one of the global educational success stories of the modern era.I was recently reminded of this meeting when reading a short pamphlet published in November 1964 by the Young Fabian authors Howard Glennerster and Richard Pryke on “the public schools”. Much of the pamphlet covers the same ground occasionally trod today by the odd brave soul: the social isiveness bred by a parallel school system for the better-off the disproportionate access of privately educated pupils to Oxford and Cambridge and then to the top jobs in society the dispersal of bursaries largely to the cash-strapped middle class and the numerous canny tax schemes enjoyed by both private school parents and the schools themselves that amount to large state subsidies to the most privileged in society. The pamphlet ended by dismissing the foolishness of those who say that state schools should “catch up” with the private sector. The answer was integration.It also quoted the Labour party manifesto of 1964, which promised that “Labour will set up an educational trust to advise on the best way of integrating the private schools into the state system of education”. It also included an extract from a document titled Signposts for the Sixties, which provided a statement of Labour party “home policy” submitted by the national executive committee to the 60th annual party conference: “We are convinced that the nation should now take the decision to end the social inequalities and educational anomalies arising from the existence of a highly influential and privileged private sector of education, outside the state system.”The Young Fabian authors concluded that “in the future, these statements may be seen to mark a turning point in the development of British education … now Labour is committed to action, and action there will have to be”. Sadly, it was not to be. As David Kynaston and George Kynaston noted in a long, cogent consideration of the issue published in New Statesman in 2014, the Labour party, if not the wider left, has largely remained silent on the issue of private schools for 40 years.We urgently need to renew the conversation about the private-public ide, and move beyond the superficial, profoundly apolitical debates of recent years. These have chiefly been characterised by the rolling out of the same information again and again, almost as if the private schools were not human creations but unchallengeable phenomena like the weather or religious deities. Over and over we are told: private schools achieve higher results their graduates vacuum up the majority of places at the best universities they take all the top jobs they dominate the top of society. There is, as a result, a continual stirring up (with the liberal help of a few capital letters) of resentment, envy and panic – “Private pupils are SIX TIMES more likely to get A* grades at GCSEs than those at state schools” “A third of private pupils score 3 A* grades at A-level compared to one in TEN at state schools” – finely seasoned with a good dollop of hopelessness: “The awful truth: to get ahead you need a private education.”Moreover, many people today still peddle the line that those prescient Young Fabian authors of half a century ago urged us not to take, which is to implore our often-battered state system to close the widening ide through non-stop “improvement”. During a BBC Radio 4 debate on education in the runup to the 2015 general election, Fraser Nelson, editor of the rightwing weekly the Spectator, argued that what was needed was more visits by the influential and successful to state schools, more internships and mentoring of the disadvantaged. Useful as such initiatives might be, to some iniduals, it is hard to see how such stopgap methods will do more than chip away at a yawning structural ide.We can’t expect the Conservatives to say much about private education. After all, it underwrites a hierarchical form of social organisation, and philosophy of inidual freedom, intrinsic to the party’s philosophy. Labour’s position in the postwar period – from roughly the late 40s to the early 70s – was, as I have indicated, to deplore the ide and promise to do something about it. In 1997, New Labour got rid of the assisted-places scheme, a system of subsidies for private schools. Yet the most marked feature of the post-1997 New Labour years has been the suggestion that state education could benefit from imitation of the autonomy, pedagogy, disciplinary atmosphere, as well as the direct patronage, of the private sector.Under this rubric, two distinct policies were pursued. One was to lure cash-strapped private schools into the state sector, via the academies and free school movement. To date, a handful of private schools have come into state education via this route, but enjoy preferential admissions arrangements and other advantages that some argue have intensified stratification within the state system. The other, much-heralded path – particularly under education secretary Michael Gove and education minister Andrew Adonis – was that of “partnership”: the idea that private schools should sponsor struggling academies. Spurred on by a mix of duty, guilt, interest in innovation or a combination of all these, some schools – including Brighton College, Dulwich, Eton, Highgate, King’s Canterbury, Wellington and Uppingham – joined the scheme. However, a number subsequently pulled out. As one private school head is reputed to have said: “I take my hat off to these guys who run academies. I wouldn’t last five minutes in that environment.” Former chief inspector of schools Michael Wilshaw was sceptical of the arrangement, telling a gathering of private school heads that the so-called partnerships amounted to no more than “crumbs off your tables, leading more to famine than feast”.If we are to move the conversation on, then, we need to be clear that the success of private education is not replicable precisely because it offers the already socially and economically privileged superior resources and opportunities that inevitably augment their confidence and capabilities in every sphere. Private day schools now cost, on average, £14,500 a year – more than the annual disposable income of the average English family. Boarding is a great deal more costly. The annual fees of a top private school such as Westminster, which sends more students to Oxbridge than any other school in the country, are around £35,000 a year for boarders. Compare this with the average per-pupil spend in a state secondary school of between £4,000 and £6,000 a year. But the difference is not only in simple resources, for the spread of pupils at many state schools will include those from deprived or struggling families, compounding the pressures on their education and those who teach them, while a private school is in general recruiting from the already affluent, literate and enterprising. Thus, we need to publicly acknowledge that the success of private education is far less to do with character building or autonomous governance than the powerful alchemy of several kinds of advantage.Now, more than ever, there is a strong moral and political argument in support of integration. At a time of growing ides and damaging inequality, we urgently need public institutions that bring the nation together, not further separate and ide us. For many in the UK, the idea of a unified education system to which all subscribe is too great a leap of the imagination, too daring a proposition – and yet the benefits of a common schooling could be immense.Finland teaches us not only that state education will never be considered truly first-rate until we give all our children the same high-quality schooling, but also that a country that educates its children together has a better chance of being at ease with itself than one that segregates different parts of the population from an early age. On a more raw political note, the greater the spread of families using a public service, the greater the pressure on politicians to commit sufficient funds to support it. Or as David Kynaston puts it, rather more amusingly: “One only has to witness pushy private-school parents on the touchline to realise that the state sector will never achieve its full capability without them.”It may be that the problem with private education is not that it is too expensive, but that it is too cheap. Certainly, low-level growling about the extent of state subsidy of private schools has a long history. The Charities Act 2006 removed the presumption that charities automatically provide public benefit, and decisions on this question were shifted to the Charity Commission, which, in statutory guidance, “ruled that people in poverty should not be excluded from the services of these ‘charities’ their benefits should be made available to a ‘sufficient’ section of the population, be quantifiable and reported on annually”. Since then, there has been intermittent and testy discussion as to whether the sharing of playing fields and libraries, and the provision of Latin taster classes and so on to neighbouring state schools constitutes sufficient public benefit. In 2014, Tristram Hunt, then Labour shadow minister for education, boldly proposed that private schools should lose some of their business-rate relief if they didn’t form more meaningful partnerships with state schools. There were even rumours, in 2017, that Theresa May would withdraw charitable status from private schools that refused to participate in the sponsorship of academies and free schools.“We recognise we have to give the schools business-rates relief,” Ross argued, “but we considered the time was right to seek better engagement with the schools and see whether their delivery of public benefit could be aligned with tackling local priorities … In an area with national pressure on education, plus county pressure on children’s services and libraries, and our borough having deprived wards in which literacy is identified as a barrier to families accessing services and employment, we need to look at, and beyond, the current arrangements.”The mood music is changing. In the runup to the 2017 general election, Jeremy Corbyn proposed that VAT should be charged on private school fees in order to subsidise free lunches for all primary school children. In December of that year, the Scottish government accepted the recommendations of the Barclay review that Scottish private schools should lose their business-rate relief, with the exception of some specialist and special-needs schools.Robert Verkaik, author of the recently published Posh Boys: How the English Public Schools Ruin Britain, calculates that “the UK spends more on private education than any other country in the developed world”. Private schools could have been expected to pay £1.16bn in business rates between 2017 and 2022. As charities, he argues, they will pay just £634.26m, equating to circa £522.31m in savings. Eton, for example, will save an estimated £4.1m in business rates over the next five years. Yet state schools, which are not charities and do not receive fee income, must pay the full rate. Verkaik also investigates the manner in which private schools, as charities, are exempt from UK tax on most types of investment income, and do not pay corporation tax, which means every penny of profit a public school makes is tax-free. If this income were taxed, it could raise up to £500m a year. He has also highlighted the considerable sums of money used to subsidise private education for the children of military families. By removing some forms of public subsidy, and perhaps taxing school fees (a report by the Fabian Society in 2010 suggested that introducing VAT on private school fees could raise around £1.5bn annually), private education might start to become more like a luxury brand, encouraging a significant proportion of parents to choose the state sector.A number of leading private schools have already indicated a willingness to participate in the scheme. However, given the overwhelming evidence concerning the social discrimination inherent in 11-plus-style tests, such a plan would exclude the genuinely poor, further deprive state schools of motivated and high-attaining pupils, justify selection at a time when it is seriously being questioned in the state sector, and bestow an additional, and wholly unjustifiable, moral halo upon private education. Earlier schemes of a similar nature, such as the assisted-places scheme, ended up largely subsidising the already educationally advantaged on moderate or low incomes.Given the considerable and sustained advantage that private-school students currently enjoy in terms of access to top universities, and from there to the most influential and well-paid jobs, there is also a case for an increase in contextual admissions criteria – ensuring that universities take into account economic and educational contexts when offering places, particularly at so-called top universities.“Potential” is always a tricky quality to judge. In a recent blogpost headlined “Making Oxbridge entry matter less”, the education researcher Rebecca Allen described a period she spent conducting admissions interviews at an Oxbridge college. “The experience completely revolutionised my view that university admissions were efficiently selecting students by ability … Those who performed exceptionally well at interview often didn’t seem to turn out to be genuinely interested and motivated by their subject.” (Allen knew this because she also worked as a supervisor of first-year students.) In other words, confident self-presentation may not always indicate authentic passion in a reverse manifestation of the same question, one state-school head told me that some of his most brilliant sixth-form students were not – yet – able to translate their passions into an acceptable form of fluency, but could be taught to do so.Allen also noted that accompanying “thinking skills” tests were clearly not tutor-proof, and confirmed that disadvantaged students were often not prepared for the demands of the interview. In the long term, we need a fresh approach to teaching and learning that will produce greater numbers of intellectually confident and questioning pupils. In the short term, given that exam results determine entry to all universities, there is a strong case for lower entrance requirements for those who have had a less well resourced education, especially since research shows that state-school students admitted to highly selective universities with the same A-level results as their private-school peers outperform the latter.Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford has recently set up a free, fully funded foundation year for students usually “underrepresented” at Oxbridge, to give disadvantaged students a taster of demanding courses at an elite institution and aid applications to university entrance proper. While some might question the sensitivity of such a publicly visible separate track for those from more modest backgrounds, it is an indication of a new determination to shift entrenched inequalities.The point is that if private-school attendance were no longer associated with a smooth transition to a top university, there would be less incentive for parents to pay fees in order to educate their children separately.Within the state sector in England, there is a less daunting transition to be managed in terms of selective education. Kent, Lincolnshire and Buckinghamshire have fully selective systems, pretty similar to those operated in the postwar period. In Birmingham, to take one example of how selection operates in the big cities, eight grammar schools cream off the most motivated and high-achieving students and make secondary transfer for all Birmingham’s parents a complex, messy and socially unfair business. While there are only 163 grammars in England – many of which are expanding fast under this government – it is estimated that the secondary education of one in 10 children nationwide is affected by the nearby presence of a selective school.We know the negative impact that grammars have on other local schools. Expensive private coaching, beyond the reach of most families, is a crucial part of winning a place at a selective school. While some ethnic groups do better than others in selective systems, grammars disproportionately exclude children from minority backgrounds. Selective schools are more likely to be rated outstanding as other local schools suffer, their pupil intake out of balance in terms of the proportion of disadvantaged, disengaged children – many of whom are demoralised by having failed the 11-plus and told that they are not up to the mark – or those with special needs. It is often hard to recruit and retain teachers. These de facto “secondary moderns” – a term no modern politician will go near, with its reference to the now widely discredited system of the postwar period, which ided children into grammar and secondary modern schools, largely along lines of class – are more likely to be judged “inadequate” or “failing”. And thus the vicious circle is complete.Lobby groups as politically erse as Comprehensive Future, a cross-party campaign group committed to phasing out selection and supporting fair admissions policies, and Bright Blue, a conservative thinktank, agree with this conclusion. Comprehensive Future proposes that we slowly open grammar schools up to a fully comprehensive intake: ensuring local populations can decide the best means of transition, what use to make of existing grammar-school buildings, and how to prepare teachers in the selective sector to teach all children to the highest level.Such a move would complete the reforms that occurred across much of the UK in the 60s and 70s. Change is still happening today. In 2016, Guernsey, a small crown dependency, voted to transform its school system, converting the island’s single grammar school and three secondary moderns into a unified system. For decades, campaigners against selection have been patiently arguing their case, putting forward the evidence and attempting to persuade others. Finally, they won. From 2019, Guernsey will have a fully comprehensive secondary school system, joining some of the most successful and modern education systems in the world. It is time England did the same.

It is not yet clear whether his successor Jeremy Hunt found a face-down stone that Johnson had somehow missed or instead a confluence of new forces has prompted her temporary reprieve.The UK ambassador in Tehran, Rob Macaire, had been given little warning of her release and she herself was given only a few minutes’ notice.The release can be seen either as a welcoming gift to the incoming Hunt, a reward for specific recent diplomatic gestures made by the UK, or an indicator of the extent to which Iran, under massive US sanctions pressures, needs all the friends it can find in Europe. It is quite possible all three factors played a role in the often opaque thinking inside Tehran’s dual regime. A visit to Tehran by the UK Foreign Office permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, in late July may also have been pivotal.Since his appointment, Hunt had made the Zaghari-Ratcliffe file a priority, meeting her husband Richard twice for lengthy discussions, describing his sympathy as the father of young children from a mixed race marriage.Hunt did not leap to escalate the crisis in a way that would have offended Iran by giving her diplomatic protection, a status the Zaghari-Ratcliffe family have been seeking from the Foreign Office for many months.He went out of his way via McDonald to assure the Iranians that his elevation to the foreign secretaryship would not lead to any change to the UK’s support for the Iranian nuclear deal, the linchpin of Iranian diplomacy. Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal in April.Indeed, Hunt signed a joint statement with France and Germany on 6 August, the day the first round of US anti-Tehran sanctions kicked in, defending the deal as “a key element of the global nuclear non-proliferation architecture, crucial for the security of Europe, the region, and the entire world”.Macaire, days after presenting his own credentials as ambassador to Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, tweeted the statement saying “its message could not be clearer”.In interviews surrounding his visit this week to Washington, and in his encounter with US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, Hunt stood his ground, insisting excessive US pressure on Tehran was only likely to lead to a regime more hostile to the west. In this, he was erging from the US on its pre-eminent foreign policy issue, a point that McDonald hammered home in his Tehran visit.But the UK has also been making some quiet gestures of goodwill towards Iran. For example, the Iranian embassy in London has been allowed to open a bank account.The head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), Ali Akbar Salehi, this week highlighted how the UK – jointly with China – had assumed responsibility for helping Iran rebuild its heavy water reactor in Arak. The UK involvement, volunteered at a meeting with Iranian officials in Vienna in July, is designed to reduce the amount of plutonium produced by the reactor as a by-product, so ensuring Iran remains inside the terms of the deal. The additional UK cooperation came after US technical experts pulled out.There have also been tentative signs of progress on the single biggest blockage in the bilateral relationship – the UK’s refusal to repay £450m outstanding debt on a 40-year-old arms deal, because of a dispute over the interest rate on the debt and the difficulty of making a payment that is not in breach of international sanctions. Tehran suggested in recent weeks that the payment need not be made in cash but in kind through medicines, so circumventing sanctions. A sympathetic British response could end a diplomatic sore that began in 2002 and has resulted in successive court judgements against the UK.Finally, Iran has come to accept that the EU is sincere in trying to soften the impact of US secondary sanctions on EU firms active in Iran.Tehran always saw the nuclear deal as a simple trade-off. It would hold off on restarting the nuclear programme so long as the lifting of sanctions led to a substantial rise in western investment.The difficulty has been that EU multinationals, faced with a choice between investing in Iran, and as a consequence facing US Treasury sanctions on its often larger US outlets, are choosing Washington over Tehran. The dollar still rules. An EU €18m package of aid to Iran announced by Brussels on Thursday hardly fills the blight on European investment caused by the US sanctions threat.The EU’s efforts to prevent an exodus from Iran has not worked, as firm after firm has announced it was abandoning planned investments. The British Airways announcement on Thursday that it was suspending its uncommercial service to Tehran symbolises how hopes of a business revival have been disappointed.British officials say it is not widely understood how the US has chosen sanctions policy, and the dominance of the dollar, as an instrument with which to impose its foreign policy rule on Europe. In Brussels, Berlin and Paris, it has prompted an anguished debate about how the intrusiveness of secondary sanctions is exposing the lack of true European economic and foreign policy sovereignty.Tehran may have realised that, given the geopolitical stakes ahead, anything standing in the way of the support of the UK’s newforeign secretary was worth re-examining."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22cc90331bc3dd3d69512d5aa9a70e80ef3ea246/9_528_2902_1740/master/2902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ff4cfd76b31639b44b49479e72dd66","title":"andy murray us open not realistic to win this year","story":"Flushing Meadows holds glorious memories for the Scot but, at 378 in the world as he grinds his way back from hip surgery, he believes this year’s title is out of reachSerena Williams sent a tremor of concern through the US Open when she pulled out of a press conference days before her opening match on Monday against the unseeded Pole Magda Linette, advising organisers she felt “under the weather” – but at least Andy Murray is still in the draw.Outside the seedings at a major for the first time in 12 years and ranked 378 in the world as he grinds his way back from hip surgery, Murray does not think he can win the tournament where he made his breakthrough six years ago. His opponent on Monday is the Australian James Duckworth, who is 67 places below him in the rankings.Almost a year to the day after pulling out of last year’s Open Murray said on Friday: “This one feels slightly different because, for the last 10, 11 years, I have been preparing to try and win the event. I don’t think that is realistic for me this year.”Williams, who surprised everyone but herself by reaching the Wimbledon final this summer in only her second grand slam tournament since a traumatic childbirth last September, was smiling and relaxed during practice on Thursday but did not, apparently, feel up to fulfilling media obligations 24 hours later. It was easy to sympathise, given the shambles of an all-day rolling press conference conducted like a bank holiday weekend puppet show on the court of the newly roofed Louis Armstrong Stadium.She is expected to play – although it was uncertain whether or not the USTA would follow the bizarre ruling of the French federation, which has banned her from wearing the black catsuit she needed to contain the muscle spasms that plagued her after her emergency caesarean section.Certainly his demeanour was better than on the day he pulled out of Wimbledon this year, having given every indication he was ready. He also withdrew from the Rogers Cup in Canada after Washington, then went out in three sets in the first round of the Cincinnati Open last week.Murray has not played Duckworth, a talented player who has had his share of injury setbacks and is in the tournament after the late withdrawal of Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. If Murray is anywhere near the level he showed when losing a tough three-setter at Queens to Nick Kyrgios, then beating Stan Wawrinka and losing to Kyle Edmund at Eastbourne, he should progress to the second round.He would then play either Feliciano López or Fernando Verdasco. Juan Martín del Potro is his likely opponent in the third round. The Argentinian, who won here in 2009, said on Friday: “I’m in good shape. As everybody knows, this is my favourite tournament on tour. I have big expectations playing in New York.”Del Potro, the third seed, will have higher expectations than Murray, although the British player has the memory of a titanic Olympic final win over him on which to draw.Murray does not see the status quo changing much this year. Rafael Nadal returns after skipping Cincinnati, where the second seed, Roger Federer, reached the final, losing to Novak Djokovic, who looks almost back to his best. Djokovic and Murray quit the 2017 season on the same day at Wimbledon but the Serb’s elbow injury looks to have healed far more quickly.Asked if he took comfort from the return of Djokovic, Nadal and Federer from various health problems, Murray said: “All injuries are completely different. Some are more serious than others. Someone is out for a few weeks with a muscle injury. It’s very different to somebody recovering from a surgery on certain parts of the body. It’s notoriously more difficult.“I haven’t really looked at them so much as an inspiration for a comeback. I’m trying to deal with the situation that I’ve been in as best as I can myself.“But I do feel that, once my body is right again – which takes time when you haven’t played many matches in a year – I’m sure that my level will be OK to get me competing at the top of the game again.”Meanwhile, Heather Watson beat Katie Swan 6-2, 6-4 to join Johanna Konta in the women’s draw at Flushing Meadows. The last two British hopefuls in qualifying found themselves up against each other and experience won out, with Watson defeating 19-year-old Swan in an hour and 14 minutes. Having not won a match at Flushing Meadows since lifting the junior title in 2009, Watson has now claimed three victories in a row."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aadef4266c90df0989c38c75bea262374c88d1e6/818_50_4654_2793/master/4654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2efee431099e8e5eab239e97d7d18db5","title":"kipyegon bett kenya epo tests positive","story":"• Bett edged out GB’s Kyle Langford at 2017 worlds in London• Bett, 20, is awaiting tests on B sampleKipyegon Bett, Kenya’s world 800m bronze medal winner, has tested positive for the banned blood booster erythropoeitin (EPO).The Athletics Kenya executive committee member Barnabas Korir said it received notification from the Athletics Integrity Unit on Thursday that the 20-year-old had submitted a positive sample.

Whether Stratum will be seen to best effect at Saturday’s trip, however, is a real concern for anyone taking a short price in such a competitive race.Nakeeta, last year’s winner of this race, was behind Stratum at Newbury but is 7lb better off and back at the trip that suited him well 12 months ago. He should run well again but may be vulnerable to a late surge from Blakeney Point and Jamie Spencer. Roger Charlton’s runner has some strong form to his name this season and looks to have been prepared with this race in mind by one of the shrewdest trainers in the business.York 1.50 Lord Glitters has yet to register a win in four starts this season, but he has been in Group One company on two of his three outings and acquitted himself well in both. He was just two lengths behind Lightning Spear in the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood last time and could have been closer still had Danny Tudhope not been forced to switch around the bulk of the field inside the final quarter-mile. Mustashry, a decisive winner of this race last year, is the obvious danger but this should be the day when Lord Glitters finally gets off the mark for the year.Goodwood 2.05 Beat The Bank is a winner over track and trip and an obvious favourite after finishing fifth in the Sussex Stakes, but a price of around 5-4 looks short with a potentially top-class performer like Altyn Orda in the field. Roger Varian’s runner returned to her best form to finish second behind the outstanding Alpha Centauri in Group One company last time out and though she is taking on male horses for the first time, 5-1 is too big a price for a filly who also finished fifth in the 1,000 Guineas in May.York 2.25 Supernova has yet to post a performance that fully justifies his status as favourite for what is often one of the strongest three-year-old handicaps of the season, having beaten four opponents last time out at odds of 4-6. However, his previous defeat of Soto Sizzler in a Goodwood maiden reads well in the light of the runner-up’s subsequent win in a hot handicap at the same track’s big August meeting earlier in the month, beating Making Miracles, Corgi and Proschema, who are all in the field, in the process. He could be a Pattern performer in waiting and 7-1 is a decent price if so, though the list of potential dangers is extensive.Goodwood 2.40 Several very promising juvenile fillies make the step up to Group company and marginal preference is for Antonia De Vega, whose winning form on debut in a strong race at Newmarket has been franked by the subsequent success of the one-and-a-quarter length runner-up, Zagitova. Dangers abound, however, the most obvious probably being William Haggas’s Magnetic Charm in the Royal colours.York 3.00 Expert Eye could not quite back up his convincing win in the Jersey Stakes at Royal Ascot when he lined up for the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood, but he was within two lengths of the winner and seems to be back to something close to his best.

In 1995, at the instigation of the late Hein Verbruggen, the then president of the UCI, the race was moved from its traditional late April-mid May date to the back end of the season, to a chorus of concerned voices.As late as 2008 there was still debate over the calendar slot but in recent years it has become clear that Verbruggen had a basically sound idea: the Vuelta could extend a narrative for the cycling season that would naturally peak in July with the Tour de France. It probably helps that the Tour de France has come to be dominated by Team Sky since 2012 Julys now regularly end with a bevy of Grand Tour specialists looking for a new target having failed to knock the British team off their perch. Luckily for them, that target now comes up within four weeks.This iconic ascent in the Picos, home to some of the last wolves in Europe, is the third consecutive mountain-top finish in a series that should shape the overall standings before a brutal final week. It is relatively long at 11km and comes after a lumpy stage through Asturias but the previous two days’ climbing are what make it truly tough this year.Santillana del Mar – Torrelavega, time trial\u0026nbsp(32km)The only substantial time trial in a Vuelta that is largely for the climbers, this looks pancake flat and will give the few strong time triallists a chance to regain time. A big day for Richie Porte and Rigoberto Urán if they can get here in one piece.The grand finale at the end of a short, brutal stage that has six categorised climbs and 4,000m of height gain. The final climb is not super long but the stage itself is brief enough to encourage attacking from the gun. It will be impossible for a team to control so the race could be turned upside down.With last year’s winner, Chris Froome, absent, along with Geraint Thomas – to the obvious benefit of the Tour of Britain – Quintana, Nibali and the Italian Fabio Aru top the contenders’ list by virtue of the fact that each has already won at least one Grand Tour, or in Nibali’s case all three. However, Nibali has had so little time to get over the broken vertebrae he sustained in the Tour de France that he says he has his eye on the world championship instead, while Quintana and Aru have impressed only in their inconsistency in the last couple of seasons.Like Nibali, Richie Porte and Rigoberto Urán are looking to redeem their seasons after crashes ruined their Tours de France Porte has just signed a two-year deal with Trek-Segafredo but he has still to prove he can finish on the podium of a Grand Tour. An attack of gastroenteritis on the eve of the Vuelta has not helped. Pinot is also in search of redemption: the Frenchman rode a strong Giro d’Italia, but fell apart in the final 72 hours, ending up with pneumonia that compromised the middle part of his season. If Quintana falters, Alejandro Valverde may step up, but at 38 he is surely too long in the tooth to repeat his 2009 victory.Even without Froome or Thomas, there is a serious British contender in the Bury climber Simon Yates, who led the Giro for 13 days this spring but cracked on the penultimate mountain stage. If he can make the leap to overall victory in the Vuelta, it would delight statisticians as, following Froome and Thomas’s wins in the Giro and Tour, this would be the first time the same nation had won all three Grand Tours in the same year with three different cyclists.The Dutchman Steven Kruijswijk is another credible candidate, having finished fifth in the Tour, but the young Colombian Miguel Ángel López carries more weight, figuratively at least. At 24 he has shown a near-perfect improvement curve since winning the Tour de l’Avenir in 2014 last year at the Vuelta, he took two stage wins, while this season he managed third in the Giro behind Froome and Tom Dumoulin.It is not only the candidates for the overall win who will be seeking redemption in the next few weeks. The French sprinter Nacer Bouhanni has had a season marred by disputes with his Cofidis team and is in a dire need of a major victory, while the former British champion Steve Cummings has fought ill-health and has been waiting all year for the Dimension Data team to give him a start in a major Tour.After taking stages in the Tour de France in 2015 and 2016, the Wirral racer was left frustrated when Dimension Data opted to put all their strength behind Mark Cavendish in this year’s Tour, a plan that ultimately came to nothing. Cummings acknowledges this has been a disastrous season for him – as it has for his team – which puts him in precisely the same situation as 2012, when he relaunched his career with a stage victory at Ferrol."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f67d78602b903362516b82833baa8732f7110a61/0_81_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7ad4adedc41c3c5d2ca9d5fe2881a2a","title":"nine foot nine review taller women sci fi dystopia feminist fantasy","story":"Assembly Rooms, EdinburghThis feminist fantasy about women worldwide suddenly growing vastly bigger and stronger than men is uneven but eloquent about power dynamicsWhat would happen if every woman in the world grew to be 9ft tall? So asks Sleepless Theatre Company’s dystopian look at gender politics that crumbles a little under its own ambition.The production focuses on a likable couple, Cara and Nate, and their daughter Sophie. Over 60 minutes we skip back and forth across Sophie’s childhood. Alex Wood’s script veers between strong character drama and somewhat earnest feminist mouthpiece. This makes many of the reflections on gender feel a bit contrived, as we learn how society deals with “Sprouters” (the name given to the suddenly larger, stronger women).The production feels slow at times and those who struggle with science fiction are perhaps unlikely to be won over. But there is still a lot to like. The story has some good reveals, such as the question of how sex and dating would change in this new future and the way Sprouter women in the developing world quickly become exploited for profit. Cara and Nate communicate using a mix of British Sign Language and spoken English, and so the implication that Nate didn’t teach his daughter how to understand sign language after Cara leaves their family carries a lot of weight.The unfussy backdrop of a series of white frames that take on different colours means it’s easy to keep track of the frequent changes of setting. Creative captioning makes a strong case for the way making work more accessible can enhance a production.The three actors have good chemistry with one another. Misha Pinnington skilfully navigates Sophie’s teenage anxieties about her new body, and Paul O’Dea plays Nate’s subtle shifts towards resentment and fear well. Alexandra James, as early Sprouter Cara, is great. Its message might be uneven, but Nine Foot Nine still says a lot about the power dynamics between men and women."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d35b595367c24ac5eee4416a1eff875d74c4f08b/192_376_3936_2361/master/3936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e22b2ff743376ae60f3260786dc1c1d2","title":"spanish government approves exhumation of dictator francisco franco","story":"Former dictator’s grandson says moving remains from mausoleum is ‘vengeful’Spain has taken another step towards dealing with the legacy of the civil war after the government approved the exhumation of the remains of Francisco Franco, which have lain in the Valley of the Fallen mausoleum near Madrid since his death in 1975.The council of ministers voted in favour of the move, which was opposed by the rightwing People’s and Citizens parties. However, the decree only needed a simple majority to pass. The Socialist party of the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, the leftwing Podemos and the Catalan and Basque nationalist parties all voted in favour.The decree means that after a dispute lasting many years, the removal of the former dictator’s remains will go ahead, probably later this year, despite opposition from Franco’s family. His grandson, Francisco Franco Martínez Bordiú, said: “The government has taken this opportunistic, cowardly and vengeful decision. This is just a trick to win votes for the left.”Pablo Casado, the leader of the People’s party, which emerged from the reformist wing of the old Franco regime, criticised Sánchez for “reopening old wounds” in an effort to “cover up the fact that he is incapable of governing”.The Citizens party, which is going head to head with the People’s party for the rightwing vote, also criticised the move. “It seems that some want to return to the fratricidal battles between reds and blues, of confrontation and ision, which is what bipartisan politics likes,” said Albert Rivera, the party leader. He claimed this type of politics was as obsolete as “listening to music on cassette or vinyl”.While the opposition argued the decision would only reopen old wounds, these have never healed for millions of Spaniards.While Franco has lain in splendour 37 miles (60km) outside Madrid, until recently, an estimated 140,000 of his opponents lay in unmarked graves around the country, buried where they were summarily executed during and after the civil war. The last of these executions was carried out in 1975.In order to smooth the transition to democracy after Franco’s death, all parties agreed to a “pact of silence”, leaving the crimes of the civil war and its aftermath as unfinished business.As a result, for decades before and after the transition, the “vanquished” in the civil war have had to live alongside the “victors”, often knowing their neighbours or local mayor are the people who murdered members of their family or confiscated their property.No one has been prosecuted and, despite plans to establish a truth commission, those who committed crimes under the dictatorship are protected by an amnesty.There has been no attempt at reconciliation regarding the civil war and it is only in recent years, when the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory was formed in the realisation that the witnesses to this history would soon be dead, that the issue has been addressed and the nation shaken from its collective amnesia.Every day, fresh flowers are laid on Franco’s grave, but the fact it exists as a monument is seen as an insult to the millions who suffered and were driven into exile by his regime. While it is a crime in Germany to venerate Hitler and the Nazis, in Spain, there is a Francisco Franco National Foundation dedicated to his memory.The exhumation is expected to be carried out in secret to avoid protests and it is not yet clear where the remains will be reburied. The government has given the family 15 days to come up with a proposal. However, wherever his final resting place, what the furore about his removal makes clear is that, while the dictator may be long dead, his legacy is very much still with us."},{"url":null,"title":"case study fr eugene greene","story":"IN 1995, shortly after he was appointed Bishop of Raphoe, Dr Philip Boyce travelled to Annagry in west Donegal to address a rumour about Fr Eugene Greene, one of Ireland’s worst sexual abusers of children. He spoke to a concerned school teacher and others but there was nobody prepared or able to give him hard evidence or make specific allegations against Greene.“There was nothing really you could do about it because you didn’t even have a name of a person abused or the name of anyone who could say anything about it,” he said yesterday. “I could not get anything.”Two years later Greene was caught. When one of his victims attempted to blackmail him, he complained to the Garda – which set in train an investigation that finally led to Greene being sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment in 2000.Yesterday’s audit goes back to 1975 and, according to Dr Boyce, over that period Greene was allegedly involved in 21 or 22 sexual abuse cases against children.However, his period of offending went long before that. He was convicted of offences against 26 boys in eight parishes in Donegal between 1965 and 1982, originally facing more than 100 charges.Before his return to Donegal in 1965, he served for 10 years with the Kiltegan Fathers in Nigeria. There are allegations that there was knowledge of his proclivities going back at least as far as 1976 but, as noted in the audit and also referred to by Dr Boyce, the main concern against Greene appeared to be over his alcoholism.It was known that he had a drink problem but not that he was a child abuser, Dr Boyce added.

File photograph: Joe O’ShaughnessyA number of established retailers and hoteliers in Ennis, Co Clare, have expressed their “shock” at the revelation that the company behind a plan to build a large motorway service area outside the town had agreed to pay the cost of submission fees in support of the plan. The business interests, who as a group have opposed the plan, have described the revelation, and the fact that some of the more than 180 supportive submissions to the council were forged, as an “unsavoury sideshow” which it hoped would not “undermine the planning process”. Businessman Pat McDonagh and his Supermac’s fast food franchise wants to build a large motorway service station, complete with retail and restaurant outlets, just off the M18, 4.8km east of Ennis.Shortly before the deadline for submissions closed this month, a single batch of more than 180 letters was received by Clare County Council. However, when the council wrote back to the supposed submitters, acknowledging also their payment of the requisite €20 fee, 40 of them contacted the council to say they had not made any submission, nor paid €20.This week, it was further revealed that Supermac’s had agreed to pay for the €20 submission fees, though no money had been handed over as yet.The company did not say who organised the campaign of submissions, only that a petition was being organised locally. It denounced the forging of signatures (which in at least one case was that of a dead person) saying: “This company is horrified to learn from the media that this exercise was not conducted legitimately and disowns the actions taken and wants to distance itself completely from them.”Yesterday, Allen Flynn, owner of the Old Ground Hotel, one of the opposing interests, said on behalf of the group that he was “genuinely shocked” that Supermac’s had agreed to reimburse people writing in letters of support.He added: “At the end of the day, the hope within our group is that this unsavoury sideshow is not allowed undermine the planning process.”Meanwhile, a woman whose late father was alleged to have made a submission in support of the plan has spoken of her surprise to find his name among those purporting to have written to Clare County Council.Paddy Russell of Clarecastle died in November 2003. His daughter Anne Marie was taken aback to learn that 15 years later, on August 10th last, he had apparently written to the council’s planning department.In the letter, the late Mr Russell declared his “full support to Mr Pat McDonagh for his recent planning submission for a Motorway Service station at Junction 12” of the M18.The letter to the council, similar to others delivered in bulk, was alleged to have been sent from Mr Russell’s home in Clarecastle.The council replied with a standard acknowledgement (for the observation letter and €20 fee), which was received at the nearby address of his daughter, whose story appeared first in the Clare Champion.“I was away last week in Germany,” Ms Russell told The , “and when I came back there was a letter addressed to my late father. When I opened it, I said ‘oh good God’.”The current occupant of her father’s former house had apparently kindly dropped the letter into his daughter’s home, some 500 meters away.Asked if she thought her father would support the plan, were he alive, Ms Russell said: “I’d say he’d go to the meetings and listen to the discussion but sure, he’d be 86 at this stage.”And her own view? “I suppose it would be good for employment but it should go through the proper channels . . . There’s something rotten with whatever is going on in Clarecastle – whatever is going on.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3606817.1535139151!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pope francis in ireland complete guide to weekend traffic restrictions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere will be seven dedicated Dublin Bus transport hubs to bring people as close as possible to the Phoenix Park for the papal Mass. Photograph: Paul FaithAFPGetty ImagesWidespread traffic restrictions will be in place across Dublin from Saturday morning to facilitate the visit of Pope Francis.On Saturday, when the pope arrives at Dublin Airport, 52 roads will be closed around Dublin’s city centre between 6am and 7pm as he attends events across the capital.Road closures will stretch from Patrick Street and Dawson Street to Cathal Brugha Street to accommodate the popemobile’s tour of the city from about 4.15pm, which is set to last about 25 minutes with more than 100,000 people expected to line the streets.The popemobile entourage will begin on Cathal Brugha Street, move on to O’Connell Street, across O’Connell Bridge, up Westmoreland Street and continue up Dame Street.The motorcade will then pass Christ Church Cathedral, go down Bridge Street and across the Liffey on to Church Street to the Capuchin Day Centre, where the pope will meet homeless families.Gardaí said the M50, M1 and Dublin Tunnel will be fully open on Saturday, with no restrictions or closures planned.Dublin Bus will operate a normal Saturday service. However, significant ersions will be in place. There will also be restrictions to the Luas service.On Sunday, a controlled access area will be in place from 6am to 11pm which includes closure of roads east of the M50 between and including the N3, N4 and N7.Dublin City Council said the M50 will be fully open on both days and only the inbound lanes at J6 Blanchardstown, J7 Lucan and J9 Red Cow will be closed to all vehicles apart from buses on Sunday.Dublin Bus will operate a Sunday service with a number of ersions throughout the day. There will be seven dedicated Dublin Bus transport hubs to bring people as close as possible to the Phoenix Park. There will be some restrictions to the Luas service on both lines. Public transport on Sunday will be free for anyone travelling in the greater Dublin area with a ticket to the papal Mass.The centre of Knock village will be closed from 6pm on Saturday. The N17 between Charlestown and Claremorris will be closed from midnight on Saturday until at least 3pm on Sunday.It looks like the pope will narrowly miss the heavy rain but thousands of pilgrims may not be quite so lucky.As heavy bands of rain pass over the country late on Saturday night, they threaten a wet start but should have cleared up by the time the pope arrives.Gerry Murphy of Met Éireann said there was a chance of a few isolated showers on Saturday but they would be few and far between. And mild temperatures of about 17 degrees will help make pleasant conditions for the Festival of Families event at Croke Park later that evening.On Saturday night, heavy rain clouds are expected across the country. How that will play out “purely depends on the timing,” said Mr Murphy, “and there is always uncertainty about that”.As of Friday, though, it appeared most likely the rain would pass in Knock by the time proceedings began. At the same time, Dublin will be experiencing a wet start to Sunday.“But by the time the pope’s Mass takes place in the Phoenix Park it should be quite dry,” said Mr Murphy. By comparison, in 1979 it was a dry day with temperatures in the range of five to 15 degrees.Pope Francis to preside over the closing ceremony of World Meeting of Families in Dublin.

The company said it was shocked to learn that some of the letters of support for its planning application sent to Clare County Council were forged. Photograph: Joe O\u0027ShaughnessyIf the large-scale motorway service station that Supermac’s entrepreneur Pat McDonagh wants to build near Ennis in Co Clare is ever constructed, it will certainly be a feature on the landscape.But its critics say it will have a “significant negative impact” on the vitality and viability of the town centre of Ennis and two local villages, as well as breaching the policy of the Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) in relation to services on the motorway network.Supermac’s Ireland, a fast-food and retail franchise, initially sought to distance itself from this week’s controversy over forged letters of support, sent to Clare County Council among a batch of 187 submissions delivered en masse to the planning department just before the deadline for such observations.However, the admission by Pat McDonagh, Supermac’s founder, that his company agreed to underwrite the cost of the support campaign (which could run to €3,600) has placed more question marks over the whole affair.The company had said it was shocked to learn that some of the submissions were made by people who had not, in fact, written the letters bearing their names. It condemned the action “utterly” and said it disowned such support.The company is keen, nonetheless, to press on with its plans, but it is facing an amount of stiff opposition. Then came the acknowledgement that the company was financially connected to the campaign (although it says that it has yet to actually pay for the cost of the submissions).The plan remains on the table, as it were, and the council is due to make its decision by September 4th. Whether approved or rejected, it would seem likely that the losing side will appeal to An Bord Pleanála.The plan is for the development of a 4.8-hectare site just off the M18 LimerickGalway motorway at Junction 12, some 4.8km east of Ennis, and 3.5km east of the adjoining village of Clarecastle.If given the go-ahead, Mr McDonagh and Supermac’s want to construct a centrally located two-storey building with a total floor area of 2,564sq m, with 100sq m allocated for retail and 710sq m allocated for eating and seating.In addition, there would be staff and office facilities of some 188sq m, a travel and tourist information centre of 148sq m, and toilets, storage and maintenance space amounting to just under 1,000sq m.There would be parking for 142 cars, eight motorbikes, 10 coaches and 15 HGV vehicles.Ennis prides itself on being a commercially successful place in challenging times. People connected to the local chamber of commerce will tell anyone who asks that the town had six retail outlets ranked within the country’s top 100, as defined by Retail Excellence Ireland. The town has also been declared Ireland’s friendliest.So it is perhaps not surprising that local vested interests came together to oppose a plan which they say “will rip the heart out of the town”, as a spokesperson put it.Nine of them, all members of the chamber of commerce, came together and submitted a 50-page objection.The nine are the Old Ground Hotel, the Temple Gate Hotel, Hotel Woodstock, Treacy’s West County Hotel, Ryan’s Centra supermarket, Hogan’s Mace supermarket, the County Boutique, the Woollen Market and Clarke’s Daybreak supermarket and petrol station.They look at Mr McDonagh’s Barack Obama Plaza motorway service area at Moneygall and see its mirror image near their town. And when they do, they see their businesses, and the jobs and life they argue they bring to Ennis, as under serious threat.According to their submission, if the plan gets approval it will have a “significant negative impact on the vitality and viability of Ennis town centre, Clarecastle village centre and Crusheen village centre which is contrary to the policies of the Clare County Development plan 2017-2023”.They argue that the proposal is also against the policy of Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), which devises policies in relation to services on the country’s motorway network.According to TII, motorway service areas (MSAs) are “essential for driver safety and to ensure the availability of services and amenities for drivers”.In line with this, TII says there should be one “on-line service area” on the M18 between junctions 7 (which is Sixmilebridge) and 12 (which is Ennis). The “on-line” element is central to objections to the McDonagh plan.On-line means the services offered are accessed directly from the motorway. In other words, drivers leave the carriageway and drive straight into the service area, as is the case on various Applegreen service areas on, for instance, the M4 and M1.The Ennis service area would be “off-line” meaning the motorists would have to exit the motorway proper, enter other roads and drive to the service area, albeit a short distance.Mr McDonagh has twice before sought permission to develop the site. One application was turned down by An Bord Pleanála the other was withdrawn.In rejecting the first application, the board cited problems with access roads, and Clare council policies of “maintaining high-quality built and natural environment”.“The board considers that the proposed development, by reason of its design . . . would not integrate satisfactorily with the rural and predominately flat landscape in the hinterland of Ennis.”Pat McDonagh will be hoping that, this time, it is third time lucky."},{"url":null,"title":"welcome to the liberties new students get a taste of inner city dublin life","story":"  August 24, 2018Shopkeepers show the best of local hospitality to the latest arrivals to the area "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

The IPO of a 5 per cent chunk of the company would be the biggest stock market float on record, with an estimated value of $2 trillion (£1.6 trillion), and would be expected to raise up to $100bn for Saudi Arabia. The move has been in the works for several years\u0026nbspbut no date or location has been set\u0026nbspand, on Wednesday, Reuters reported the flotation had been shelved. The news service said Saudi Arabia had pulled the domestic and international listings of Aramco and cited senior industry sources. It also reported advisers working on the deal had been disbanded. The news followed reports this year the chances of the kingdom continuing with plans for an international listing were “diminishing”. However on Thursday, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister\u0026nbspKhalid al-Falih said: “The government remains committed to the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, in accordance with the appropriate circumstances and appropriate time chosen by the government.”The Saudi government also said, in preparation for the listing, it had “undertaken a number of major preparatory measures, including issuing a new income tax law as it relates to hydrocarbons activities reissuing a long term exclusive concession and appointing a new board of directors, amongst other measures to safeguard its interests and those of the company’s future private shareholders”.Chance of Aramco listing in London or New York ‘may be diminishing’Public listing of Saudi oil company may be delayed until 2019UK Government agrees $2bn loan guarantee for Saudi AramcoLondon, New York and Hong Kong are among potential hosts for the record breaking IPO. The kingdom’s denial of the IPO cancellation will come as a relief to bankers and advisers who stand to make $200m from the float. According to reports, international banks JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and HSBC were appointed as global coordinators and boutique investment banks Moelis \u0026amp Co and Evercore were chosen as independent advisors.

The IPO of a 5 per cent chunk of the company would be the biggest stock market float on record, with an estimated value of $2 trillion (£1.6 trillion), and would be expected to raise up to $100bn for Saudi Arabia. The move has been in the works for several years\u0026nbspbut no date or location has been set\u0026nbspand, on Wednesday, Reuters reported the flotation had been shelved. The news service said Saudi Arabia had pulled the domestic and international listings of Aramco and cited senior industry sources. It also reported advisers working on the deal had been disbanded. The news followed reports this year the chances of the kingdom continuing with plans for an international listing were “diminishing”. However on Thursday, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister\u0026nbspKhalid al-Falih said: “The government remains committed to the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, in accordance with the appropriate circumstances and appropriate time chosen by the government.”The Saudi government also said, in preparation for the listing, it had “undertaken a number of major preparatory measures, including issuing a new income tax law as it relates to hydrocarbons activities reissuing a long term exclusive concession and appointing a new board of directors, amongst other measures to safeguard its interests and those of the company’s future private shareholders”.Chance of Aramco listing in London or New York ‘may be diminishing’Public listing of Saudi oil company may be delayed until 2019UK Government agrees $2bn loan guarantee for Saudi AramcoLondon, New York and Hong Kong are among potential hosts for the record breaking IPO.

It was a fairly low-key event, with a portable stage not much bigger than the park’s bandstand. The lineup was comprised of mainly tribute acts.Fast forward to 2018, and Bingley Music Live, as the event evolved into, is preparing for its biggest three-day festival yet, on the weekend of Friday 31 August. This time the roster is a little more impressive: Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Jake Bugg, Public Image Ltd, Shed Seven, former Spice Girl Melanie C… and all on a stage that wouldn’t be out of place at one of the summer’s big-name festivals.But, so what? Festivals are big business in the UK, and the summer calendar is stuffed with internationally-renowned acts zipping between fields across the country. Just down the road from Bradford, the Leeds Festival is twinned with its more venerable cousin Reading, and together they form the apex of the festival pyramid with old-stager Glastonbury (when it’s not having a fallow year, like this summer).But also on the calendar is Latitude, the Isle of Wight Festival, RiZE (formerly the V Festival), Wireless, Creamfields, BBC Music’s Big Weekend, Bestival… it seems that no matter where you are in the country, sling a 12in picture disc like a frisbee any time over the summer and you’re almost certain to hit a music superstar on the head.But what makes Bingley Music Live a slightly different beast is that just like the inaugural Music at Myrtle\u0026nbspevent in 1991, it is still run by the local authority. No longer free, of course, because you don’t get Noel Gallagher out of bed on the sort of money you can make up by adding a few quid on the council tax bills. But value for money certainly, compared to the big commercial festivals, and certainly pulling its weight in the ring with many of them.A spokesperson for Bradford Council said\u0026nbspthat when Music at Myrtle was set up in 1991, nobody really expected that it would become the major player it is now. She says:\u0026nbsp“When we held our first small free concert few could have envisaged that the festival would grow to attract such big names as Pet Shop Boys, Kaiser Chiefs, Manic Street Preachers, Chic and Nile Rogers, All Saints, Jess Glynne\u0026nbspand James who have all played over recent years.”The key, though, is that Bingley Music Live has grown organically. Bradford Council never set out to make a full-blown festival, it expanded a little bit year by year. She adds:\u0026nbsp“Although it has come a long way from its humble beginnings and it is unusual for a council to be involved in such a big festival we have grown it gradually and now it sees 15,000 people a day flock to the town for festival weekend.”\u0026nbspIn its early years, Music at Myrtle was split into themed days, with old rockers such as Bradford’s own Smokie on the bill, newer bands for the younger audience, and jazz. In 1998 Bradford Council partnered with local radio station Pulse to make the event a two-day festival, with Pulse using their clout and contacts book to bring in bigger names such as Liberty X, McFly, Rachel Stevens and another Bradford boy-done-good, Gareth Gates.That continued into the 2000s, until what was then billed as the Party in the Park hit its first major bump in the road. In February 2007, the event was summarily cancelled. Rising costs and declining audiences were blamed, and the Pulse’s station director, Tony Wilkinson, told the local paper,\u0026nbsp and\u0026nbspArgus, that support from the music industry for such small festivals was on the wane. He said that the record labels did not have “as many artists out on promotional tours to provide a top class running order”.Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo ParkWhat nobody envisaged in 2007, though, was that the music industry was in the throes of a massive shakeup. Downloading and streaming of music was in its infancy then, and music acts still made the majority of their money from physical album and single sales. However, a decade on, that situation is reversed nowadays it’s the touring of live shows and pounding the festival beat that earns pop and rock bands a crust.It would be nice to think that Bradford Council was playing something of a blinder back in 2007, but the chances are that it was pure serendipity. Either way, within a couple of months of the announcement that the Myrtle Park festival was dead, it rose from the ashes.The original plan was to scale back on the A-listers and give more of a platform to unknown, local bands. The rescue package had been put together wholly by Bradford Council, and they were obviously mindful of the budgetary restrictions of putting on a big festival but still wanting to provide residents with a music event of some description.Indeed, it was the residents of Bingley in particular who lobbied the council to save the festival in some form. This was at a time when the financial crisis was just bubbling over, and it’s fair to say that Bradford had been hit harder than most cities. Neighbouring Leeds had stolen a march on city centre development and by the mid-2000s had a thriving retail and leisure sector that put it in a stronger position to weather the credit crunch.aren’t too far removed from its neighbouring Leeds\u0026nbspBefore the financial collapse, Bradford had been on the up as well. Large swathes of the city centre had been demolished to make way for a brand new shopping centre built by Westfield. The majority of the work on taking down the tired, old buildings began in 2004, but by 2007 everything had stalled, leaving Bradford with an infamous hole in the ground that made it look as though it was ground zero of a meteor strike. It wasn’t until 2015 that the centre was completed and opened… and, to be fair, did help to kickstart a much-needed revitalisation of Bradford.So it was understandable in that atmosphere in 2007 that people wanted some form of entertainment, and Bingley Music Live was it. That year’s festival was indeed\u0026nbsppared down, but still attracted some recognisable names – Bruce Foxton’s post-Paul Weller “From The Jam” outfit, the Charlatans, the Bluetones. The following year brought the Happy Mondays, Echo and the Bunnymen, and local heroes Terrorvision.\u0026nbspBy the time the first headliners the Charlatans returned in 2012, the festival had added a third day on the Friday, and the festival was really on an upward curve.But can a local authority really justify the cost? There are partners of course, including Ticketline, Mercure Hotels and Carlsberg. But surely it doesn’t make any money?According to a Bradford Council reply to a freedom of information request last month asking for income and expenditure on Bingley Music Live over the past three years, in 2015 there was income of £946,000 against just over £1m in costs. In 2016 income was down at £822,000 against very similar costs, but last year, with costs standing at £1.15m, there was gross income of £1.3m… leaving a net surplus of £222,000.Having attended the event last year, those figure’s aren’t surprising. It was packed and money was flowing over the bars and food concessions. It’s also a very family-oriented event. And with ticket sales ensuring 15,000 come through the gates every day this year –\u0026nbspwhich the coup of booking Noel Gallagher has certainly helped with –\u0026nbspit looks likely that Bingley Music Live is on an upward trend.Being in the middle of one of the Bradford district’s big towns as well, rather than in splendid isolation on a field somewhere in Hampshire, there are extra benefits. My council spokesperson says: “The event is a big thing for Bingley’s businesses, with its many excellent pubs, bars, shops and places to eat all busy with people for the full weekend. The festival is also embraced by the local Bradford and Bingley Sports Club who provide camping for festivalgoers on their fields.”Ariana Grande and James Corden perform hit-filled version of TitanicWhy drag queen Vicky Vox is starring in Little Shop of HorrorsCamp Bestival forced to close early due to poor weather conditionsWhile Bingley Music Live might be unusual in being local authority-run, its model of being an “urban festival” is one that is becoming increasingly popular… and can pay idends for local economies.Journalist Claude Lynch, writing in CityMetric earlier this year, said that while the big, camp-out-all-weekend festivals were declining, smaller, urban festivals were thriving… and possibly because of a sense of community. He wrote: “Multiple studies into the dynamics and economics of festivals make similar arguments about how to drive ‘re-patronising’ – in other words, how to make festivalgoers want to come back next year. Evidence suggests that ‘social identification’ – having something in common with other festivalgoers – is often just as important as the quality of the music or the food. Festivals can capitalise on this boon of social identification by offering a self-contained event designed\u0026nbspwith both locals and tourists in mind. Locals are more likely to patronise events that emphasise community spirit while tourists are enthused by events that symbolise and epitomise the local culture.”From very humble beginnings 27 years ago, Bingley Music Live has survived and thrived, often against the odds, and when international superstar Noel Gallagher takes the stage in a couple of weeks’ time, it will be the culmination of the dogged determination that gets things done in this part of the world… and looks like providing the template for the future of live music.For more information go to bingleymusicliveMusic at MyrtleEnter

approach” to Earth on 29 August.It is classified as an “Atens” body, which means its orbit comes into the vicinity of Earth.Some have described as bigger than the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Colosseum and the London Eye, while others have opted for more local comparisons\u0026nbspusing Leicester Cathedral and the Victoria shopping centre in Nottingham as the yardstick against which to measure this cosmic visitor.Nasa estimates the asteroid is somewhere between 70 and 160m in diameter, meaning that if it was at the bigger end of the scale it would indeed rival major landmarks like the pyramid.Almost certainly not. While Nasa has described the asteroid as “potentially hazardous”, it\u0026nbspis expected to pass us by a distance of 3 million miles.The diameter of the Earth is about 8,000 miles. Any object that comes within 4.6 million miles of the planet comes under the “potentially hazardous” category.Other asteroids are actually expected to pass much closer to our planet in the coming days, although admittedly ones only measuring around 6m.Nasa have previously issued a statement saying that “no asteroid currently known is predicted to impact Earth for the next 100 years”.Are you

Philip Hammond visiting the Francis Crick Institute, a top biomedical research centre that relies heavily on European fundingBritain stands to lose around half a billion pounds of annual European science funding in the event of a no-deal Brexit, jeopardising research into cancer and other health treatments, new figures reveal.The UK receives €1.28bn (£1.15bn) every year from Horizon 2020, the EU’s funding programme for science and innovation.The nation would lose around 45 per cent of the cash, and its ability to influence key European projects, in a no-deal scenario, according to analysis by the Scientists for EU group.The government had previously attempted to reassure scientists by claiming they would still have access to EU funding under ‘third country’ rules, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.But following the publication this week of their plans for a no-deal Brexit, the government has updated advice to scientists to concede funding from the EU would be lost.\u0026nbsp“Third country participation does not extend to some Horizon 2020 calls”, the advice now reads.That line\u0026nbspupdated a report published at the beginning of August which said: “In a no-deal scenario, UK researchers and businesses would be able to apply to, and participate in all those Horizon 2020 calls open to third country participants from the date of exit.”Without full membership of Horizon 2020, the UK would lose access to money from the European Research Council (ERC), Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) and SME Instrument grants, which are not available to “third countries”.The revelation comes after leading scientists voiced concerns about a chaotic exit from the EU and declared their support for The Independent’s Final Say campaign, calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina

make up the biggest chunk of funding from the EU, and losing them would be a major hit to the UK’s scientific community.Professor Lisa Bortolotti, of the University of Birmingham, and whose mental health research s psychology, psychiatry and philosophy, said\u0026nbspthat without the\u0026nbspprogrammes, “projects like mine could not be pursued in the UK”.“Losing ERC funding is mad,” she added.Olivier Stephan, who coordinates grants at the Francis Crick Institute, said the ERC drives some of the country’s most important science, citing its work fighting cancer.While, he said, the institute was\u0026nbspworking on the basis ongoing grants are safe, there are fears for the future of British scientists and the country’s ability to attract foreign talent.On top of a hit to UK science, the SME Instrument programme provides £143 million to small, innovative UK businesses, funding around 17 per cent of their research and development.The government has said it will step in to replace any lost funding if necessary, but the effects of third country status go deeper than monetary value, according to some experts. \u0026nbsp“Throughout my career I have had many, many grants, but none as transformational as the ERC grants,” said Professor Carlos Frenk, a cosmologist at Durham University. “Access to these grants to a very large extent determines where the very best researchers in the world want to go.”“In short, it’s a mess,” said Dr Mike Galsworthy, programme director at Scientists for EU.Besides the “chilling effect” the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is having on grant applications and hiring in the sector, he noted people who received EU grants were having to register with the government “just in case”.“So it’s devastation if it does happen, and just lesser damage, red tape and waste if it doesn’t,” he said.According to Scientists for EU, third country status would also mean UK researchers in European projects could no longer take leading roles, as the EU will not be willing to put them in charge of the money.\u0026nbspThat\u0026nbspis why Dame Anne Glover, president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, says it is essential the government arrives at some kind of deal.“If that doesn’t happen, there is a danger of us being a sort of lame duck, just looking at what the opportunities are and trying to become partners in research consortia without driving anything,” she said.The Tories’ plan for a no-deal Brexit is not looking so sunny any more‘Not realistic’ for UK to trade on WTO rules straight after BrexitDespite assurances, Dame Anne said she felt “we are really no further forward” with understanding the status of science after Brexit.“In March next year if there is no deal, the EU is not going to scrabble around to help researchers in the UK,” she said.“There may be an accommodation reached for a period of time, but there will be a hiatus, and research does not work well with a hiatus.”Professor Frenk added, unlike some of the predicted effects of a no-deal Brexit, the loss of scientific funds would not change the country overnight.“The effects won’t be seen tomorrow, they won’t be seen next year – they will be seen gradually over the years as we see a general decline in the scientific excellence of the UK,” he said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or

Police are investigating the scene after a man and woman were exposed to nerve agent novichok and are in critical conditionDr Mackiewicz, whose research looks at women in the 16-24 age bracket,\u0026nbspsaid there was a greater stigma attached to women drinking than there was to men.“If men go out drinking, it’s ‘oh they are a typical male’ but if a woman goes out drinking, it’s seen as dreadful. Tabloid articles always pick on women - they will always have pictures of women half-dressed drinking. It’s been happening since the 18th century. William Hogarth, a London artist, had a series of prints where women are condoned for drinking alcohol.”\u0026nbspThe study found that among countries where alcohol consumption is commonplace, just two other countries - South Korea and the Gambia - witnessed men and women consuming the same quantities. However, in both instances, it was considerably lower levels than those in Britain.In historic terms, far more men drank alcohol than women. Men born between 1891 and 1910 were twice as likely as their female counterparts to consume alcohol and more than three times as likely to be involved in problematic use.But a study published in the journal BMJ Open in 2016 found that in all three respects, this had almost reached parity among those born between 1991 and 2000.Katherine Twamley, senior lecturer in sociology at University College London, said the stigma which surrounded women and drinking had declined.“On the face of it, this research does suggest more convergence among men and women in their practices,” she told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“More parity in drinking may in part be due to more women engaging in paid work\u0026nbspand therefore in post-work drinking. There is also much less stigma around women drinking than say 50 years ago. These can be considered as positive changes for many women.”\u0026nbsp“But as a feminist scholar, I would say that huge amounts of feminist debate has centred around the kind of gender equality we aspire to as well as how we can achieve it. As in, do we want women to become just like men?\u0026nbsp“Traditionally masculine behaviours are in general more respected in society - competitiveness, risk-taking, ambition - while behaviours traditionally associated with femininity and women have received less respect - such as care and compassion.\u0026nbsp“For me, to see parity in drinking alcohol as a boon for gender equality is a mistake, especially as it relates to dangerously high levels. This could be seen as a further signifier that traditionally male culture is being seen as the standard by which women should live.\u0026nbsp“That is a race to the bottom\u0026nbspin this particular instance. And given that women experience worse health impacts for the same amount of alcohol intake, one could say that it is, in fact, a sign of further inequality rather than equality.”\u0026nbspThe new study also found giving up drinking completely is the only way to avoid the health risks associated with alcohol.Alcohol-related problems kill around seven per cent of men and two per cent of women every year\u0026nbspand drinking is the leading cause of death and disability for people aged 15-49.Despite previous research suggesting\u0026nbspmoderate levels of drinking may protect against heart disease, the new research concluded that any supposed health benefits\u0026nbspare radically offset by the costs.Addressing the findings on women, Andrew Misell, a director at Alcohol ConcernAlcohol Research UK, told The Independent:\u0026nbsp“Women have been drinking more like men for a number of years now, and as a result, alcohol-related health problems amongst women are increasing. But the reasons why women are drinking more is complex.\u0026nbsp“One of the key reasons links to changes in society where women are much freer to choose their own lifestyle today than they were in previous decades. Of course, none of us would want to change our freedom of choice in this or many other issues.\u0026nbsp“But the fact of the matter is that we all, male and female, need to consider our relationship with alcohol – how we drink and why and consider whether we need to change our drinking habits to improve our health and wellbeing both for the short and long-term.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/24/15/chicken-human-league-uk-5.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6489716  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/24/15/chicken-human-league-uk-5.jpg","title":"mcdonald s chickens mcnuggets salad welfare breed humane league","story":"Created with Sketch.Fast-food giant accused of buying birds bred to grow so quickly their\u0026nbsporgans can’t copeClick to followThe IndependentChickens can collapse under their own body weightMcDonald’s condemned for using chickens that suffer heart failureMcDonald’s is under fire from animal-welfare activists who say the chickens it uses for food suffer heart failure and lameness because they are forced to grow fat too quickly.Menu items such as McNuggets, chicken sandwiches and salads come from birds that have been selectively bred over time to put on weight more rapidly than is natural, causing painful health problems, according to the campaigners.They claim\u0026nbspthe world’s biggest fast-food chain failed to address the issue of the fast-growing breed when it issued a new animal-welfare policy last year.Providing chickens with enrichments and improvements is meaningless until they change to breeds with better welfareThe\u0026nbspanimal welfare\u0026nbspcampaigners have now launched a worldwide campaign, beginning with\u0026nbspMcDonald’s,\u0026nbsplobbying against companies that use\u0026nbspthe breed in intensive farming systems.The new guidelines that McDonald’s issued in October require suppliers to follow new standards by 2024 for raising and slaughtering chickens, including increasing the amount and brightness of light in chicken houses and providing birds with access to perches that promote natural behaviour.McDonald’s condemned for using chickens that suffer heart failureThe company also pledged to conduct trials with suppliers to measure the wellbeing of different breeds.But the Humane League UK says the pledges still allow quickly growing breeds to be commonplace in factory farming systems.They grow so big\u0026nbspso fast\u0026nbspthat their bones and organs cannot keep up, according to critics of intensive farming, who claim the weight of the birds’ upper bodies causes leg pain and lameness, sometimes collapsing under their own weight, while the pressure on their hearts means birds often die prematurely of heart disease.When they are handled badly before transport or slaughter, their weak bones means their legs often break.Broiler chickens account for 95 per cent of all land animals farmed in Britain, with animal charities also arguing the barren warehouses where they are reared are cramped and cruel.The Humane League says today’s birds “have been made into genetic monsters that grow unnaturally fast and often cannot even walk. Their environment is crowded, filthy and devoid of anything related to a natural life.”Pru Elliott, of The Humane League, said: “Despite claiming to invest in animal welfare, McDonald’s is showing resistance to change and lack of leadership on the issue of chickens reared for meat.“McDonald’s uses free-range eggs and organic milk so why does it source chickens that have been bred to grow so fast their bodies can’t keep up? This doesn’t make sense, and ultimately chickens are suffering en masse because of it.“Chickens are the most numerous farmed animal and suffer in the greatest numbers, so why are McDonald’s failing to make change where it really counts?”A coalition of groups opposed to factory farming wants food firms to sign up to the “better chicken commitment”, a new set of standards that includes using breeds that grow more slowly, reducing overcrowding, providing better living environments and ending cruel slaughter practices. The standards go above and beyond the minimum legal requirements for poultry welfare.Ms Elliott said changing the breed used was the crucial factor in curbing “unthinkable” suffering.“Providing chickens with enrichments and improvements is meaningless until they change to breeds with better welfare, because the birds’ suffering is such that they can’t make use of them or appreciate them,” she said.The Humane League has launched a worldwide campaign, called I’m Not Lovin’ It, to put pressure on McDonald’s.A series of events in the UK included inviting passers-by to throw damp sponges at a volunteer dressed as the chain’s publicity character Ronald McDonald, who was put in stocks activists dressed as him visiting the company’s headquarters flashdancing in Leicester Square, London, and handing in a petition with 236,000 names.Pret A Manger signed up to the better chicken commitment within four hours of the campaign’s being launched. Azzurri Group, which operates Zizzi and Ask\u0026nbspItalian, has also signed up.McDonald’s said it is committed to sourcing food and packaging sustainably.“This includes continuing to invest significantly to raise welfare standards for the animals in our supply chain and undertaking research to increase industry understanding of the challenges that remain,” said a spokesman.He\u0026nbspsaid farms that rear its chickens must meet independently set farm assurance standards.“In addition to this, for a number of years we have required them to provide enrichment objects for the birds to peck and perch on, as well as windows in their houses to provide natural light,” he added.\u0026nbsp“We recently announced a Global Chicken Sustainability Advisory Council, a multi-stakeholder group including leading academics and animal health and welfare experts, global suppliers\u0026nbspand NGOs.\u0026nbspThis group will provide deep expertise, erse perspectives, and recommendations for evolving our chicken welfare and sustainability strategy across the world.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/10/19/barry-gardiner.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/10/19/barry-gardiner.jpg","title":"labour brexit eu referendum john mcdonnell jeremy corbyn far right conservative","story":"Created with Sketch.Remarks from shadow chancellor come after a frontbench colleague said such a move would be undemocratic and could cause civil disobedienceClick to followIndy PoliticsLabour not taking new Brexit deal referendum off the table, John McDonnell saysLabour is not taking the option of a fresh EU referendum off the table, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said, as he also warned about the potential of the far right in Britain to exploit the issue.The remarks from one of Jeremy Corbyn’s most senior allies came after the party’s Brexit spokesman made\u0026nbspsimilar comments but another cabinet colleague argued a second public vote could lead to civil disobedience and social disruption in the UK.Mr McDonnell also described the government’s release of 24 technical notes –\u0026nbspoutlining official preparations for a no-deal scenario –\u0026nbspas “extremely worrying” and said Labour will fight a disorderly Brexit.Labour says new Brexit referendum is possible if May’s deal rejectedNo-deal Brexit could disrupt delivery of foreign sperm to BritainDrug companies told to stockpile extra medicines for no-deal BrexitNationalism makes you weak, poor and morally insecure, EU warnsAppearing on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr McDonnell was asked to clarify Labour’s position on a second EU referendum after Sir Keir Starmer made clear the option is possible if parliament rejects Theresa May’s agreement with Brussels or if a no-deal exit is looming.The previous day, Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, said he opposed a fresh vote, suggesting it would undermine democracy and could result in “social disruption, perhaps civil disobedience”.Mr McDonnell said: “It’s not Labour Party policy to have another referendum, we respect the past referendum, but we recognise that when the government comes forward with its proposals –\u0026nbspif it does, I’m worried we might be in a no-deal situation –\u0026nbspbut when the government comes forward with its proposals, parliament will decide the next step.“My own view is as I’ve said consistently, the Labour Party is not opposed to any kind of democratic engagement –\u0026nbspI’d prefer a general election.”UK news in picturesBritish Secretary of State for International Trade, Liam Fox, attends a signing ceremony for memorandums of understanding between British and Chinese firms and institutions at the British ambassador\u0027s residence in BeijingNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe hugs her daughter Gabriella, in Iran.

Political analysts have pointed to the comments as a potentially winning strategy for Democrats faced with answering isive comments along the campaign trail leading up to the 2018 midterms — from Donald Trump’s impeachment, to kneeling during the anthem.In an off-the-cuff statement, Mr O’Rourke highlighted peaceful protests shaping American society throughout history while focusing on the actual issues NFL players are attempting to spotlight by kneeling during their televised games.“My short answer is no, I don’t think it’s disrespectful,”\u0026nbspMr O’Rourke said when asked about his thoughts on the matter from a voter. “Here’s my longer answer, but I’m gonna try to make sure that I get this right because I think it’s a really important question. And reasonable people can disagree on this issue. Let’s begin there. And it makes them no less American to come down on a different conclusion on this issue, right?”“Peaceful, non-violent protests, including taking a knee at a football game point out that black men, unarmed, black teenagers, unarmed and black children, unarmed, are being killed at a frightening level right now, including by members of law enforcement, without accountability, and without justice,” he added. “And this problem – as grave as it is – is not gonna fix itself and they’re frustrated, frankly, with people like me, and those in positions of public trust and power, who have been unable to resolve this or bring justice for what has been done and to stop it from continuing to happen in this country.“And so non-violently, peacefully, while the eyes of this country are watching these games, they take a knee to bring our attention and our focus to this problem to ensure that we fix it. That is why they are doing it. And I can think of nothing more American than to peacefully stand up, or take a knee, for your rights, any time, anywhere, in any place.”The comments sparked massive support from Americans of various backgrounds and affiliations, from celebrities and athletes to elected officials and moderate voices.\u0026nbspThey also began a conversation about how Democratic candidates should answer questions with honesty and compassion towards a variety of perspectives, especially during a politically ided time like 2018.\u0026nbsp“A great example of a person who does this well is Beto O’Rourke in Texas,”\u0026nbspsaid Jon Favreau, Barack Obama’s former director of speechwriting, in this week’s episode of the podcast Pod Save America. “The way he answers some of these questions, the way that he talks to his constituents, it’s like, ‘reasonable people can disagree on this issue. On one hand he’s a strong progressive, he’s an unafraid progressive, he’s a confident progressive on a whole bunch of different issues,” he added,\u0026nbsp”but on the other, he’s willing to use a language which says, ‘yeah, I’m willing to cooperate and compromise with Republicans — when it helps your life’.”\u0026nbsp“We don’t know if Beto can pull this off,” he added, “but the campaign that he is running and how he answers questions, and how he talks about issues, that is the model for candidates in 2018 and 2020, whether or not he pulls this off.”Ted Cruz criticised Mr O’Rourke after the comments went viral, claiming his Democratic opponent “raised big” money from Hollywood for his defence of the football players.“Beto raising big $$ from Hollywood by supporting NFL protests of the national anthem,”\u0026nbspMr Cruz wrote on Twitter. “But in Texas? Vast majority of Texans stand for the flag, honor our veterans, and support the brave men \u0026amp women of law enforcement”.“People can protest without disrespecting the flag,”\u0026nbsphe continued.\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesIsrael\u0027s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, second from left, speaks as Lithuania\u0027s Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis, second from right, Latvia\u0027s Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis, left, and Estonia\u0027s Prime Minister Juri Ratas listen during a news conference at the Martynas Mazvydas National Library in Vilnius, Lithuania.

A month later, Russia’s Supreme Court upheld the decision and ordered the group’s official representation to disband. \u0026nbsp“It doesn’t matter where in Russia they try to worship – in their meeting houses, which the state is beginning to confiscate, or in private homes,” said\u0026nbspGeraldine Fagan, author of Believing in Russia – Religious Policy after Communism. “It\u0026nbsprepresents the worst roll back of religious freedom since the fall of Communism.” \u0026nbspIt is unclear exactly why the Kremlin chose to use its broad extremist laws against the movement. Initially\u0026nbspthe Russian Justice Ministry’s moves against the group appeared to be\u0026nbspa response to an aggressive leafleting campaign.\u0026nbspSome have suggested the group’s opposition to overt patriotism and violence played a role. The influence of the Russian Orthodox Church, which views Jehovah’s Witnesses as a dangerous sect, is also apparent.\u0026nbspIn the 17 months since the ban was enacted, dozens of Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses have been arrested. Most of an\u0026nbspestimated 175,000 members of the denomination\u0026nbspin Russia no longer advertise their faith. Many, it seems, are looking for new lives elsewhere.\u0026nbspAccording to the Finnish Immigration Service, the number of applications from Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses grew from five in 2016 to more than\u0026nbsp100 in 2017 and 2018. The number of asylum applications also grew, from 193 in 2016 to 309 in the year to date. The\u0026nbsplatter figure\u0026nbspincludes all kinds of groups – from opposition activists to refugees from the northern Caucasus.Finnish immigration officials told The Independent the vast majority of Jehovah’s Witnesses applications have yet to be processed. There had been only a “handful” of accepted applications and a “handful” of negative decisions, officials\u0026nbspsaid with nearly all of those rejected since appealing.\u0026nbsp“Each of the cases is dealt with on an inidual basis,” The Independent was told. “Persecution of these groups has not been systematic across Russia, and the approach of the ministry has taken this into account.”\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull speaks to the media during a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, AustraliaHigh waves hit Jeju Island, South Korea, as powerful Typhoon Soulik gradually approaches the Korean PeninsulaA Palestinian man throws his child in the air following morning prayers marking the first day of Eid al-Adha celebrations on the compound known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem\u0027s Old City.

Will our current free movement regime be rebadged as a “Labour Mobility Framework”?Such a move, speculated on in the media this week, would be politically toxic and very poorly timed. It would also betray her own instincts, which she rightly gave voice to when she became Prime Minister.Striking a chord with millions of people angry and alienated at their voices being ignored by the political elite on immigration and the downside of globalisation, delivered for her record poll ratings then and a real feeling of hope that at last people in power were listening.Yes, the main driver for the Leave vote was about democracy, independence and national sovereignty but it was also about the fundamental choice that a UK outside the EU would have: Who comes to our country and on what basis – decided by our own Parliament.Voters have noticed that the tightening of the labour market and record employment levels, as revealed by the Office for National Statistics last week, mean that at long last real wages – i.e. pay packets less inflation – are slowly rising and that belatedly big business is beginning to move away from an over reliance on cheap foreign labour, undercutting the pay and conditions of indigenous workers and giving rise to higher welfare dependency.It might seem a radical concept, but such employers might just have to pay workers decent wages, train them better, improve their skills and try hard to retain them. That’s why EU workers are still coming to the UK in huge numbers, despite ridiculous Project Fear stories to the contrary.So yes – Brexit will mean higher pay for British workers! Top businessman Stuart Rose, briefly spokesman for the Remain campaign, accurately predicted such a development before the EU Referendum.Regrettably, the multinationals’ trades union, the CBI didn’t get the message: No surprise that they now want no restrictions on foreign workers post Brexit – in other words an endless pool of cheap labour just like now.Likewise, they’re happy to defend the growing gap between average pay and that of FTSE 100 bosses.Ironically, The Prime Minister could still snatch victory from defeat on this issue, notwithstanding her lamentable record as Home Secretary on reducing net immigration to the tens of thousands.The alternative White Paper which David Davis and his Ministers were working on prior to it being dumped at Chequers, was much more evidence-based and looked to many workable international examples of mobility agreements between first world countries like Australia, the United States, Japan and Canada, as a model for future EU-UK immigration arrangements, to our mutual benefit.The policy would have been informed by the Migration Advisory Committee which reports next month, focused on what was the sensible policy for the whole of the UK and all business sectors rather than a noisy minority and their well-paid advocates.It also sought to end the systemic bias towards low paid and low skilled EU citizens over the well qualified from across the globe.It was pro controlled immigration and not about pulling up the drawbridge and that’s where most British voters are now.Will Theresa May use the opportunity to keep faith with the millions of people in the north and the midlands, in south Wales and south west, who look to her to keep her promises and defend their interests and not just those of the well heeled, the multinationals and those comfortable with the Brussels status quo?Will putative leadership contender Sajid Javid have the courage to resist further attempts at craven supplication on continuing free movement in all but name? Will Conservative MPs who benefited from the highest ever blue collar vote for their party in history, ignore their own electors’ concerns and just accept further concessions?The electoral prospects of her party depend on it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Appropriation.In the eyes of today’s politically correct policers of “wrongthink”, there is no greater crime than cultural appropriation.Cultural appropriation is when people embrace the grub or music or ideas of a culture that isn’t theirs.Like when Kylie Jenner wore her hair in cornrows. Or when Katy Perry donned a Japanese kimono. Or when drunken lads on a university campus put on sombreros as they neck shots of tequila.All of these things have been branded cultural appropriation by today’s potty warriors against “offensiveness”.And to this blacklist of things we must never appropriate, we can now add non-native foods.This is not the first time Jamie Oliver has been criticised for making foreign dishes. Two years ago foodies were up in arms when he put chorizo in paella — which the Spanish tend not to do.Clearly Jamie Oliver is only allowed to cook “white” British food, like roast beef and toad-in-the-hole.Not Cornish pasties or Yorkshire puddings, though.After all, what right does a man born in Essex have to appropriate the food of Northerners and people from the West Country? And presumably Dawn Butler only ever tucks into Jamaican dishes.If it is cultural appropriation for Oliver to make jerk grub, surely it must be cultural appropriation for Ms Butler to rattle up a bit of sushi?This would be the crazy conclusion to the war on cultural appropriation — none of us would ever dip into other cultures and experience their pleasures.What is most depressing about the Butler/Oliver spat is that it confirms how mainstream the miserabilist, divisive PC worldview has gone.It used to be just time-rich posh kids and snowflakes on university campuses who raged against cultural appropriation.Like the officious students at Cambridge who banned an Around The World in 80 Days fancy-dress party for fear students would wear “culturally appropriated” costumes.Or the clipboard bores at the University of East Anglia who banned students from wearing sombreros.Or the easily offended muppets at the University of Ottawa in Canada who banned a yoga class, because for white people to indulge in this ancient Indian discipline is an act of “cultural genocide”.I bet you never knew that when you do a pelvic tilt at your local gym you are being a horrible racist.Now, however, with Butler’s missive against the crimes of Jamie Oliver, this PC claptrap has crept from the fringes into the political centre. Butler is Shadow Secretary for Women and Equalities, and she is very close to Jeremy Corbyn.Is this what we should expect under a Corbyn government? Finger-wagging at anyone who deviates from PC rules?The worst thing about the clampdown on cultural appropriation is how divisive it is. The message is that we must always stick with our own cultures and never borrow from others.Didn’t that used to be known as racism?In recent years, Beyonce has been slammed for wearing a sari. Glastonbury has banned attendees from wearing Native American head-dresses. Selena Gomez was ridiculed for doing a Bollywood- inspired dance on US TV.This new racial divisiveness makes ­culture stiff and dull.Anthony Horowitz, author of the Alex Rider teen spy novels, says he was “warned off” from writing a black character. Apparently a white writer like him ­cannot understand the black experience.Is this really the world we want to live in? Where people never mix and never try to empathise with those who have had different life experiences to theirs?We should stand up for cultural ­appropriation.The global intermingling of food and fashion and art has enriched human life.As the great American novelist Lionel Shriver reminds us: “People with different backgrounds rubbing up against each other and exchanging ideas and practices is self-evidently one of the most productive, fascinating aspects of modern urban life.”Yet in their Brave New World, everyone would stick to their own people and their own ways. What a dispiriting, divided world that would be.I would far rather live in a world than has Jamie Oliver jerk chicken in it than in such a racially regimented PC nightmare.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They both agreed: too much soy sauce, but otherwise delicious. Last month Gwen van der Zwan, from the Netherlands, tried cannibalism for the first time.However, shes no Hannibal Lecter and no humans were hurt in the making of her dinner.Instead, she made the meal from her own blood - which she had painstakingly drained into a medical bag that day - after becoming fascinated with the idea of trying a human sausage.Why is my idea considered disgusting, but doing the same thing with pigs blood isnt? she asked at the time.Although shes rare in acting publicly on her unusual tastes, Gwen is far from the only one to be fascinated by cannibalism.Dating-style fetish sites match up those desperate for human flesh with those who want nothing more than to be eaten alive themselves.Cannibal seeks meal, one post reads. This 37 year old male seeks a nice cute piece of meat. I prefer girls.Another says: Im a thirty-something man looking for a female so we can sample each others flesh. Cut together, cook together, and eat together. Non-lethal cuts so we can enjoy eating one another. Would-be victims refer to themselves as longpigs - a term meaning human flesh which was used by man-eating Pacific islanders who thought people tasted like pork.But why would anyone want to eat, or be eaten by, someone else?Experts say that cannibalism is largely to do with power - breaking the ultimate taboo leaves man-eaters feeling euphoric.Therapist Karen Hylen has even suggested that cannibalism can become addictive for a small number of people with psychopathic tendencies, comparing the act of eating someone to a cocaine high.On Reddit, a growing number of posters chat openly about their fascination with cannibalism, although comments seem to often be driven more by a morbid curiosity than anything else.Bill Schutt, author of Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History, ate a human placenta when writing his book.He told Sun Online: We think cannibalism is revolting because thats what our culture dictates. Other cultures that didn’t get that memo have had very different attitudes toward cannibalism. For example, in the mid-20th century, the Wari people of Brazil were apparently just as upset to find that Western anthropologists buried their dead as the anthropologists were aghast to learn that the Wari ate their loved ones after they died.In June, a 38-year-old man took to Reddit to share the story (verified by Vice) of a dinner party where his friends tucked into a meal made from his amputated foot.After a motorbike accident in 2016, he had the smashed limb cut off - and doctors let him keep it.Then, three weeks later, he threw a brunch for ten willing friends where the main course was tacos made from the flesh which had been amputated.The anonymous man posted photos of the dish, and explained how he kept his mangled foot in the freezer until it was time to cook it.Then he cut out a chunk of flesh, marinated it overnight and sauteed it with onions, peppers and lime juice.Posting on Reddit, he says: I taste like buffalo. But chewier. Super beefy and a little fat. We werent looking to go all Hannibal and get gourmet - just to make it so no one gagged.My friends and I always had this joke, he adds. If you could try human flesh in an ethical and healthy way, would you? And we always said of course. Well the opportunity came up and I called them on it.It was a neat experience, and I wouldnt change it.Obviously if you kill someone to eat them then the appropriate offence would be murder. There could be liability for unlawfully preventing a burial or outraging public decency if a desecrated body was publicly exposed or eaten in public.But we couldnt criminalise the eating of human flesh as most of us consume bits of our own bodies, like nibbling your own fingers for example.So although eating human flesh isnt strictly illegal, consenting cannibal arrangements can stray into dark territory.Samantha says: The law sets limits on what you can lawfully consent to. So, for example, you couldnt consent to someone chopping off your finger to consume it.In the UK you certainly couldnt consent to being killed to be eaten.Where we have seen cases of cannibalism in English law these have been charged as murder.In Gwens case, it all started because she had been thinking about how her friends would react if she really made a dish from her own bodily fluid - so last month she got online and ordered a set of needles and a blood bag.A couple of days and a few YouTube tutorials later, she punctured the skin on the inside of her elbow and started filling a bag with half a litre of her blood.Listening to the sounds of blood splashing into the bag, Gwen wondered: What would my mom think if she saw me sitting in my living room like this?Once she had extracted half a litre of her own blood from her now weak and purple-looking arm, she removed the needle - accidentally squirting a few droplets onto the carpet.Then, with the help of a close, not-too-squeamish friend, Gwen mixed lentils, tomato puree, soy sauce, and herbs into a filling and sloshed in almost the entire bag of blood.The kitchen looked like a slaughterhouse, she jokes in a Munchies article.Amazingly, many of Gwens friends were eager to try her creation, which she served up, MasterChef style, on white plates with a bloody jus.We cut happily into the sausages and chewed on them as if we were judges on a cooking show, she writes.The texture was very good and the level of spiciness was perfect. Unfortunately I went a bit heavy on the soy sauce, so the sausage is a bit salty. Not bad, though.However, not all would-be cannibals are so easily satisfied with just a bite of blood sausage.An alarming number of online posts feature requests for victims willing to be eaten alive to satisfy cannibalistic sexual desires.The forum which hosts hundreds of these posts is the evolution of Cannibal Cafe, a now-defunct website for cannibals seeking the same.Supposedly, the message board is for fetishists who want to role play as man-eaters, but we know from a high-profile case on Cannibal Cafe that some users were deadly serious about eating someone they met online.German IT technician Armin Meiwes was among the unknown number of legitimate cannibals lurking on the site.In the most notorious case of cannibalism this century, he posted: looking for a well-built 18 to 30-year-old to be slaughtered and then consumed.Bernd Jürgen Armando Brandes, an engineer from Berlin, answered his advert in March 2001, stating that he was willing to be killed and eaten.A few days later, the pair met in Meiwes home in the small town of Rotenburg and filmed a video where Meiwes cut off and ate Brandes penis, with his consent.As Brandes bled to death, Meiwes fried the penis in a pan with salt, pepper, wine and garlic.He later stabbed his victim the throat and hung his body on the meat hook.He ate the remains over the following ten months, hiding body parts in his freezer and eating up to 44 pounds of human flesh - all for the supposed sexual pleasure of it.The cannibal wasnt arrested until 2002, when another ad he posted online was brought to the attention of the authorities.Even though his victim had agreed to being killed and eaten, he was eventually convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.Today, Meiwes is a vegetarian and says he regrets his crime, but he estimates that there could still be as many as 800 active cannibals in Germany alone.As for the number of cannibals elsewhere, experts say its impossible to guess.But new posts pop up on the cannibal forum every day, and based on the chatter online it seems like the appetite for these dark and unconventional tastes is only growing.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But that’s where we have got it so wrong.It comes as no surprise that nearly 50 per cent of UK schools are failing to achieve the target 25 per cent of A-level entries in STEM subjects — science, technology, engineering and mathematics.The nation is crying out for STEM skills. It is estimated there is a STEM-worker shortfall of 40,000 — and it is set to rise. We are facing a national crisis.Yet schools are rewarded on delivering grades, not different subjects. And this relentless focus on grades means youngsters are potentially being deprived access to high-paid and fast-growing careers.Research shows interest in maths and science dramatically declines during secondary school.When it comes to gender, there is a big difference. Interest in STEM subjects drops by 56 per cent among boys and 74 per cent among girls.Quite often girls underestimate their performance and, although they get better grades in maths and physics at GCSE, fewer of them take the subjects at A level than boys.There is this perception that you have to be a genius to do maths or science, but that is not true.Often teachers will say unless you get a grade A in maths or science at GCSE, don’t even bother taking it for A level. The reality is, even if you get a lower grade in the subject, it is still viewed very well by employers. Even if you take just one STEM subject, it will open up so many more doors.This is one of the reasons I created Future Finder, a free app to show young people the relationship between subject choices and their career pathway.After all, this is about preparing them for a job, not getting them to the top of the school system.Science is also fun, it is creative. It’s not dull and nerdy, which is how it is often perceived.We need to tell youngsters there are such jobs as autonomous vehicle engineers, gamification designers and carbon capture technicians, because you can’t be what you can’t see.Sixty-five per cent of children entering primary school now will end up working in jobs that don’t yet exist. And unless young people are learning the right skills, they’re not going to get them.Nearly 30 years ago, when I set up a data analysis company with my husband Clive, people threw data away because it was too expensive to keep. We went on to create Tesco Clubcard, the world’s first supermarket loyalty card.We were only a small business, but we had the skills to figure out something Tesco couldn’t on its own — exactly what its customers were buying.It revolutionised the way we shop, the supermarket doubled its market share within the year and we went from employing 30 staff to 1,500.We were at the forefront of a new science and it was an amazing time.I’m incredibly lucky and I’ve had a brilliant career. Now I want to help give back by preparing tomorrow’s talent.I was the chair of Your Life, a national campaign to encourage youngsters to consider careers in STEM.As a result of that movement, the Government now gives schools an additional £600 per pupil studying maths at A level.Figures also show that STEM subjects are becoming more popular. More than a third of all A-level entries in 2018 were in these subjects and more girls are taking STEM subjects.But we are already far behind countries such as America and China. That gap is only going to get wider too, as we estimate we will need 1.3million more science professionals by 2030.If schools are the talent factory then we need to deliver the skills the nation needs. We must start by giving extra weighting to maths and physics when it comes to measuring a school’s success.We are defined by the talent coming through our schools. That’s our future, that’s who we will be.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Precious little.WHAT credibility can Labour’s promises over the freedom of the media possibly have when their single biggest financial backer is the odious Max Mosley?Leave aside that he is a former fascist who was present as his father Oswald’s thugs marched through a Jewish area of East London chanting “Jews out”.He now bankrolls Corbyn’s mob, to the tune of £300,000 last year alone, because he knows they will try to crush the popular Press given the chance. His apparent sole motivation being revenge after his lust for Germanic sado-masochistic hooker orgies was exposed.This, then, is the rancid state of Labour:A cesspit of a party, run by public schoolboy Marxist class warriors, infested with anti-Semitic racism and funded by one of the most unimaginably unpleasant individuals in public life.How proud its MPs must be.IT’S far too easy for banks to blame ­customers conned out of their savings.Most of us are still too savvy to give our details to cold-callers or emailers. But the scams grow more and more credible and sophisticated. It’s easier than ever to be taken in and plenty are.The Financial Ombudsman argues that it’s unfair to assume victims are “grossly negligent”, and we agree.The onus must be on banks to beef up their security processes and software to keep our funds safe — as well as to keep hammering home to all customers the risk in handing over information.Last year only a quarter of the £240million stolen got refunded.That represents a shameful shirking of responsibility.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have got agreement on about 80 per cent of the issues.Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer claimed the release of todays technical notices was a sign of panic from ministers.He said: No Deal has never been a viable option. It has never been credible and I dont think the Prime Minister thinks it is a viable option.Dressing up the severe consequences as if that could be accepted or that could somehow be smoothed, is not to reassure anybody.And Hilary Benn, chair of the Brexit select committee, complained that the documents dont provide an answer to the Irish border question.He said: There is still no clarity on how the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland will be avoided, and ministers have simply told businesses to seek advice from the Irish Government.This is an extraordinary abdication of responsibility.Business leaders welcomed the publication of more details - but warned ministers they must go further in reassuring Brits that No Deal would not lead to disaster.Adam Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce said: Public preparations for all eventualities – and clear, crisp communication with affected businesses – are long past due.UK Finance boss Stephen Jones added: The Government is taking a pragmatic approach to addressing critical cliff-edge issues and to ensure consumers and businesses can continue accessing vital cross-border services.Anti-Brexit campaigners blasted the dossier, claiming it proves No Deal would devastate the UK.Labour MP Ben Bradshaw from the Peoples Vote campaign said: We are in this shambolic situation because the Government has utterly failed to come up with a proposal that is acceptable to either the EU or even their own party.They have made a catastrophic mess of this process from start to finish and that’s we’re looking down the barrel of a disastrous No Deal Brexit.David Davis, the previous Brexit Secretary, claimed he wanted to publish the No Deal notices as early as March - but was blocked by Cabinet colleagues."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004241313632.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"corbyn media reform mick hume opinion","story":"Addressing the annual Edinburgh Television Festival, Corbyn declared that the UK news media is “failing”.Presumably the Press was to blame for his failure to answer the same question on Brexit no fewer than six times the day before.Fear not, Labour’s Great Leader has a plan.He proposed a one-off tax on big tech firms such as Google and Facebook.But not to fund hospitals, social care or anything useful.Instead, Corbyn wants to back “news co-operatives” that will produce “investigative, public-interest journalism” and produce a more “informed public”. Corbyn’s speech was full of cuddly sounding expressions.But the real message was clear: Never mind all that freedom nonsense — let’s nationalise the news.So, the Labour leader says he wants to invest taxes in public-interest journalism.Who would want journalism that goes against the public good?But the question is: Who decides what the public interest might mean?Government ministers? High court judges? Simon Cowell and Cheryl? Jeremy Corbyn’s press office?Look a little closer and it is clear there is no consensus on what qualifies as public-interest journalism.It is just an ethical-sounding excuse for imposing your own interests on what are really matters of personal taste and political preference.One thing seems certain: It will not be the British public deciding which sort of public-interest journalism taxes should finance.Corbyn wants his state-backed media fund to be “independent”.A buzzword that should raise the question: Independent of what?There are no independent angels floating above the grubby political battles below, with only the public interest at heart.Everybody has interests and agendas of their own.Labour’s independent media funding body would be another government-backed quango, stacked with placemen from the political and cultural elites.Corbyn had the nerve to protest that the media today is “unaccountable”.Yet his independent media board would be less accountable to the public than newspapers, which must respond to their readers who pay their hard-earned money for their newspaper of choice.As for taxes funding journalism to create a more informed public — informed by who, peddling which line?It is not hard to imagine the sort of information Corbyn wants the media to feed us, it would be like the old Russian Communist party paper Pravda.It is no coincidence that the Labour Party’s biggest individual donor last year was the odious, Press-hating Max Mosley.The Labour leader singled out something called the Bureau Of Investigative Journalism as an example of an independent outfit that should be given charitable status and tax perks.Would that be the same self-righteous bureau that prompted the BBC’s flagship Newsnight programme to throw its ethics overboard a few years ago and falsely inform us that a Tory lord was a paedophile?Newsnight never recovered its reputation in the wake of the debacle.When Corbynites talk about wanting a more “diverse” media, one thing they do not mean is diversity of content and opinion. They want a conformist media that will report what it is told and not ask awkward questions.Even the BBC — bastion of the Remainstream media establishment — is too insolent for Labour’s tastes.If you want to see the real face of Labour’s attitude to journalism, just look at Corbyn’s smirking response to a Sky News reporter who asked him some straight questions about the recent wreath-laying controversy.His contemptuous reply basically said, “You have no right to know what I do or think” — in which case, neither do the mass of viewers.Labour’s track record gives the lie to any notion that it is interested in a more open media.The non-Corbynite deputy leader, Tom Watson, is an even more embittered Press-hater.Who does Jeremy Corbyn think he is, to be laying down the law on what a free Press should or should not investigate, and protesting to regulators when they report facts or express opinions not to his liking?Yet Corbyn’s quasi-Stalinist vision of State-approved journalism seems to go down well with his cultish fan club, who ensured that #ChangeTheMedia was trending on Twitter even before he spoke in Edinburgh.Perhaps they should more honestly have made it #ChangeTheMedia-OrElse.“Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or The Mail,” Corbyn claimed yesterday, “doesn’t automatically make it news.”If he had his way, it would be more a case of: “Just because it’s news, doesn’t automatically mean it should be allowed on the front page of The Sun.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Remainer sabotage? Or just another tone-deaf blunder?Either way, he left the Government looking even more chaotic than usual.Will No Deal happen? Consider this:Britain has offered “unconditional” security cooperation with the EU post-Brexit. In response, Brussels vows to CHARGE us to access its databases.They want capitulation, not a deal.JEREMY Corbyn’s sole motive in “changing the media” is to silence a hostile Press.The giveaway was when he attacked broadcasters yesterday for following up Sun stories. “Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or Mail doesn’t automatically make it news,” he whined.Could this be because recent front pages have exposed Labour’s racism? That IS news, as page one stories in the two biggest daily papers tend to be.Britain already has the world’s most vibrant media. Corbyn is feigning some high-minded interest in improving it. But the last thing he wants is it holding a future Labour Government to account.He detests scrutiny, as his tantrums sparked by tricky questions prove.As for his plan for a state-run Facebook rival, can you imagine anything more ridiculous or pointless?The ­Austin Allegro of social media, making ­gargantuan losses for taxpayers?And how about his “Netflix levy” to fund the BBC?Is there no limit to the costs he wants to pile on ordinary people?NOW, by contrast, is the time for the Tories to CUT taxes.There is depressing talk of a new hike to fund the NHS. But the public finances are in unexpectedly good shape, the deficit plummeting and growth on the up.Corporation tax should be as low as Ireland’s, stamp duty slashed to get the housing market moving, fuel duty lowered, and income tax cut too.With No Deal Brexit more likely, we need to boost the economy and lure investment with a low-tax regime as never before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

published in medical journal The Lancet - also reveals that Brit ladette women drink equivalent of three standard drinks a day, putting them at eighth place on the table, just before Irish women.By contrast, British men ranked 62nd of the 195 countries surveyed, even though they also drink an average of three tipples a day.The top countries for drinking are all in Europe, many in Eastern Europe and, according to the results, men are most likely to abuse alcohol around the world.Men in Luxembourg and Ukraine are also among the worlds heaviest drinkers, consuming on average roughly seven drinks per day. However Luxembourg fares far better than Ukraine in preventing alcohol-related disability and death.Experts say the trends are alarming and have warned of growing rates of liver disease among middle-aged women who had continued the ladette drinking habits of their younger years.The Global Burden of Disease study looked at levels of alcohol use and its health effects in 195 countries, including the UK, between 1990 and 2016.Analysing data from 15 to 95-year-olds, the researchers compared people who did not drink at all with those who had one alcoholic drink a day.They found that out of 100,000 non-drinkers, 914 would develop an alcohol-related health problem such as cancer or suffer an injury.But an extra four people would be affected if they drank one alcoholic drink a day.For people who had two alcoholic drinks a day, 63 more developed a condition within a year and for those who consumed five drinks every day, there was an increase of 338 people, who developed a health problem.Previous research suggested moderate booze levels — around one drink a day for women and two for men — may protect against heart disease.But the new research, pooling data from 592 studies with 28 million participants, suggested any alcohol benefits are outweighed by harms.The findings showed the risk of developing an alcohol-related health problem rose to seven per cent for those having two drinks a day and soared to 37 per cent for those who downed five drinks.2.

Policies focusing on alcohol consumption to the lowest levels will be important to improve health."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427843057-e1535120052843.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"elon musk tesla employees twitter erratic behaviour","story":"His increasingly erratic behaviour, bizarre tweets and production problems are becoming a huge concern to his staff and investors, reports claim.Once-loyal workers have described a company in chaos and their billionaire boss as someone who promises what he cannot deliver.A source told the New York Post: Elon talks about being a socialist and doing good for mankind, unless you work for them...

His enthralling true story has now been made into the movie, BlacKkKlansman. But first director Spike Lee had to be convinced the tale was real.In events that seem too fanciful even for Hollywood, Ron became the first black member of the all-white KKK.Ron’s gripping memoir tells how he was even asked to LEAD the vile group’s Colorado Springs chapter, so convincing was his cover. The intelligence he gathered let cops stop bombings, stamp out the burning of crosses to intimidate black locals and also identify white supremacists in the military ready to prepare explosives and supply guns.Ron — played in the movie by John David Washington, son of Hollywood A-lister Denzel — recalls: “From an intelligence standpoint, we were successful. No cross-burnings in seven and a half months during this investigation.“They talked about bombing two gay bars — but they didn’t. We stopped two Klansmen whose job in the military was to deal with explosives from carrying out a threat to bomb. They talked about stealing automatic weapons from Fort Carson (army base) in preparation for a race war. We gained valuable intelligence.”For decades, the KKK waged a campaign of hate, violence and murder against non-whites. Ron was frequently on the receiving end of racist abuse.He was sworn in as a Colorado Springs police officer on his 21st birthday in 1974, and spent those first years honing his skills as an undercover cop, becoming their first black undercover narcotics detective.His infiltration of the KKK came about almost by chance. In 1978, while scanning the local papers for suspicious activity, Ron spotted a classified ad for a local KKK chapter. He answered using his real name, doubting he would hear back.Now 65 and retired, Ron says: “I told him I was a white man, that I hated blacks, Jews, Mexicans, Asians, that I thought the white man had not got a fair deal in this country. I signed my real name instead of my undercover name and mailed it off, thinking I would get a pamphlet, a brochure or something.”Two weeks later, the phone rang at Ron’s desk. To his amazement, it was a local KKK organiser.Shocked Ron reached for the most hate-filled response he thought would impress a Klan member.The delighted Klansman replied: “You are just the kind of guy we are looking for. When can we meet?”Ron says: “I had to formulate a plan real quick. I told him I couldn’t meet him now. We agreed to meet a week later.I started putting things in motion, getting a white officer to pose as me for this face-to-face meeting.”Ron scrambled to put together an official investigation, recruiting narcotics officer “Chuck” — not his real name — to play Ron in person. He would conduct most of the work over the phone, while Chuck went to secret Klan meetings. Star Wars’ Adam Driver plays a character similar to Chuck in the movie.Though their voices sounded very different, the investigation was never rumbled — despite one close call.Ron, who now lives in Utah, says: “The people I was dealing with were not, to use an old adage, the brightest bulbs in the socket. Only once in the entire seven months of the investigation was I ever challenged as to why my voice sounded different to Chuck’s.“Chuck had gone to a meeting I set up and later that day, as I thought about something said at that meeting, I got on the phone and called the local organiser. I started talking as if I’d been at the meeting.“But he said, ‘You sound different — what’s the matter?’ I coughed a couple of times and said I had a sinus infection. He said, ‘Oh, I get those all the time. Here’s what you need to do to take care of that’.”Ron even had conversations with “Grand Wizard” David Duke — a former Klan boss and one of America’s most reviled racists.Ron came across a phone number for “the Voice of the Klan” and Duke, played in the movie by Topher Grace, picked up on the other end.Ron says: “He laughed and said, ‘I’m the Voice of the Klan’. He identified himself as the Grand Wizard, the director. I told him I was a new Colorado Springs chapter member and was honoured to speak with him.“He was very much like Donald Trump in that he liked to be fawned over. He liked flattery. I played that game and flattered him a lot.”During their conversations, Duke, now 68, had no idea he was talking to a black man. He found out for the first time a decade ago. Ron even describes Duke — a white supremacist and Holocaust denier — as being pleasant to talk to when he wasn’t discussing race.Ron says: “Inevitably, race would come up. Dr Jekyll turned into Mr Hyde and the monster in him came out. He said vile things about racial groups and people of colour, ethnicities and people, as they put it, who were not ‘pure Aryan white’.”The racism Ron fought has not gone away Ron cheekily asked Duke if he ever worried about talking to black men over the phone without realising.The clueless Duke told Ron he could tell if callers “weren’t pure Aryan white” by the way they pronounced “certain words and phrases”. The remark had Ron “cracking up laughing”.In another twist, Ron was asked in his role as police officer to guard Duke at a rally in Colorado. Duke never recognised the man he had been speaking to on the phone.Ron even had a Polaroid photo taken with Duke, throwing his arms around the Klan leader. Behind the camera was Chuck, the cop who played his white alter ego.Ron says: “Duke ran to get (the photo) out of my hand. I told him, ‘If you touch me, I will arrest you for assault of a police officer. That is worth about five years in prison. Don’t do it’. He stood there dumbfounded.”Sadly, the picture was lost as Ron moved house 40 years ago.His undercover operation was brought to a close in March 1979, after the local organiser of the Colorado Springs Klan asked Ron to take over as LEADER. Instead, he was ordered by the police chief to shut down the investigation and cease all contact with the group.Ron says: “The chief made it clear he wanted ‘Ron Stallworth, Klansman’ to completely disappear.”No arrests were made during the sting. Ron says: “That was always a bone of contention around law enforcement circles — and among people like David Duke, who try to downplay it. Nobody was arrested for a criminal offence.”But, Ron insists, the investigation WAS a success. When he got a tip that a cross-burning was about to happen, the police would send cars to prevent it.When the operation was wound up, Ron’s boss ordered him to destroy all evidence of the investigation.But he took home some files — including his Klan membership card with his name on it. After his operation ended, Ron spent time as a narcotics investigator and on special assignment with the Colorado Attorney General’s organised-crime strikeforce. He retired in 2005, writing his memoir in 2014.Spike Lee’s film opened here yesterday, a year on from the death of Heather Heyer, 32. She was killed in Charlottesville, Virginia, when a white nationalist driver ploughed his car into a crowd of people protesting against a far-right rally.Footage of that is included in the film, underlining that the racism Ron fought against has not gone away.Ron says: “Spike Lee has done a masterful job making this movie.”Predictably, a lonely dissenting voice is that of duped David Duke. The bitter racist tweeted: “This whole KKK film is a big lie.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I couldn’t speak to my family.”After losing his accent because of the time he spent gaming, he began to seek counselling.He urged others who use games “like escapism to basically ignore the real world” to do the same.The student added: “When youre doing that you dont really associate it as being a problem - you see it as a tool thats helping.In reality its something thats having a really negative effect on their lives so they should be going to a GP or psychologist.”Gaming addiction was classified as a mental health disorder by the World Heath Organisation (WHO).In June, doctors revealed plans for the first NHS-funded clinic for internet bosses but NHS foundation bosses in Central and North West London did not say the number of patients who were signed up."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000428637350.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"indonesia festival exhume graves loved ones","story":"Locals dig up dead loved ones, wash, groom and parade them around the street for the corpse cleaning ceremonies.The freaky photos were taken at Lembang Lempo Poton village today, in Toraja, during the Manene harvest festival.The strange tradition started centuries ago when an animal hunter found a decaying corpse, and dressed him in his shirt to gave him a proper burial.He believed after the burial he was blessed with good fortune, and the Torajan people bought into it.The new images appear to be the first showing tourists getting involved in the festival.The mummies are walked around the village, following a path of straight lines.These straight lines are perhaps the most important part of the ceremony.According to myth, the lines are connected with Hyang, a spiritual entity with supernatural power.The soul of the deceased must follow the path of Hyang to reach the afterlife.The Torajan people, from south Sulawesi, believe familial relationships do not end at death.Bodies of relatives and friends are dug up - even babies and children - as part of their three-day annual celebrations.The families open the coffins and let the bodies dry.Afterwards, they wash, groom and dress the mummies in fancy new clothes.All of this is done while smiling ear-to-ear, because crying and mourning is prohibited.The villagers believe they are honouring their dead with cheerfulness.After the walk, the villagers sacrifice buffalo and pigs as an offering for the deads free walk to heaven.Damaged coffins are also fixed or replaced."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004241351005.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markles bishop uncle","story":"New images reveal 76- year-old Fred, who prefers the moniker Bishop Dismas F Markle, wearing flowing golden robes and a hat.But despite his grand appearance Fred — brother of Meghan’s dad Thomas — lives more like a ­pauper than a priest.He owns a modest home in Sanford, Florida, with his adult son Nicholas.Fred is estranged from wife Theresa and their other son David, who lives in Pennsylvania with his family.The bishop chooses not to live at his listed address and instead camps at a church just outside of the US city.Formerly Our Lady Queen of the Peace Catholic Church, he proclaims it an outpost of the Eastern Orthodox Catholic Church.It is completely closed to the public and hasn’t seen a single parishioner since the 80s.Fred, also pictured this month while out buying fast food, is believed to have last seen Meghan when she was six.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet, we can’t help but feeling we are looking at a cover-up.“It’s been over nine months since Carl’s death and we’re no further forward in getting answers… I owe it to Carl to get the full picture.”Now a Sun investigation has established that the allegations involve two “incredibly mild” incidents of inappropriate touching, and a more serious allegation which was “recycled” - having initially been dealt with a year and a half earlier.On one occasion, he supposedly put his arm around an activist in a bar at a political event the summer before his death.It was apparently months before this was reported to the Welsh Labour Party.Another allegation seems to have involved him touching another woman’s knee.We have been told that the third allegation against Mr Sargeant was “recycled”.It was an old claim first made in 2016 by a Labour Party employee who apparently said Mr Sargeant once ‘twanged’ her bra strap.No action was ever taken against him.But this complaint was re-heated and resubmitted days before his death in 2017.The reason this is important is because a Labour Party member must make a complaint to trigger a party investigation.A Welsh Labour Party source, who does not want to be named, told The Sun: “This historic complaint was resurrected because - unlike the other two complaints - it was made by a Labour Party member.“Someone, it’s not clear who, went back to the Labour Party member who made this complaint in 2016 and asked her to resubmit it as if it were new.”The tragedy unfolded in Downing Street on Monday, October 30, 2017, when the so-called ‘Sexminster’ scandal was gaining momentum.That day, Wales’ First Minister and its Labour Party leader Carwyn Jones visited Theresa May in Number 10.He then told the media he had never received a “direct allegation” about sexual harassment involving a Welsh Assembly Member.Yet strangely, over the next few days several insiders, including a BBC reporter, received text messages tipping them off that Sargeant was about to lose his job in a forthcoming reshuffle - meaning they knew his fate before he did.On Friday November 3, Sargeant was told by Carwyn Jones vague details about the harassment allegations and abruptly dismissed.The decision to fire him from government was made after one of Jones’s senior Welsh Assembly aides, Matt Greenough, who is paid from the public purse, had talked to his accusers.It’s not known what, if any, official notes were taken of these conversations or where they took place.All of this happened sometime between Monday afternoon and Friday morning.The matter was then handed over to Labour, becoming a party issue.At no stage were the police involved.Oct 30, 2017: First Minister Carwyn Jones tells media he had never received a “direct allegation” about sexual harassment involving a Welsh Assembly member.Early Nov: Allegations of sexual harassment made against Sargeant. The 2016 “bra twang” allegation is said to have been resubmitted.Nov 2: Presiding Officer Elin Jones orders a review into how complaints of sexual harassment are dealt with by the Assembly.Nov 3: Sargeant sacked as Secretary for Communities and Children and suspended from the Labour Party pending an inquiry.Nov 6: Carwyn Jones tells media he’d become “aware of a number of incidents at the beginning of last week” involving Sargeant.Nov 7: Sargeant found dead at his home in Flintshire.Nov 10: First Minister orders an inquiry into how he handled Sargeant’s sacking.Nov 13: Inquest opens and a provisional cause of death is given as hanging.Nov 23: First Minister refers himself to independent inquiry to examine whether he breached the ministerial code over a 2014 claim there had been no complaints about bullying in his government.This was a cruel blow for the well-liked Sargeant, who rose from a job at a chemical plant to first representing his beloved Labour Party in the Cardiff parliament in 2003.A friend told us: “Carl was an authentic working class politician, which is very rare in politics these days. He was very popular among the grass roots of the Labour Party.”On Monday November 6, Carwyn Jones told the BBC he had become “aware of a number of incidents at the beginning of last week” involving Sargeant.He said: “I asked my office to speak to those women involved who had provided detail of those incidents. As a result of those conversations I felt I had no choice but to refer the matter to the party.”Note that Jones did not use the term “alleged incidents”, ADD “seemingly” suggesting Sargeant’s guilt had already been established when it certainly had not.Sargeant’s lawyers immediately wrote to the Labour Party describing Jones’s comments as “clearly prejudicing what is allegedly an independent inquiry” by the Labour disputes office.The letter made clear his “anxiety”.This was pertinent given he was reportedly on anti-depressants.And it raised the “very real possibility that the evidence of the witnesses is being manipulated.”The next morning, November 7, Sargeant was found dead at home on the Flintshire council estate where he grew up.But why would anyone have it in for Sargeant?The answer: dirty politics.Sargeant - the popular voice of the people in Welsh Labour - was considered a strong contender to be the next leader.This apparently worried supporters of the altogether more middle class would-be candidate, Vaughan Gething.Leighton Andrews, a former minister in Welsh Labour, has spoken of a “toxic culture” in the party and accused Jones of presiding over “minor bullying, mind games, power games, favouritism, inconsistency of treatment to different ministers, deliberate personal undermining on occasion”.“Carl was unquestionably the target of some of this behaviour,” Andrews wrote recently.“The relentless drip-drip of disinformation — and worse — had a strain on his and others’ mental health. The First Minister was made aware of this by several ministers, including myself. Nothing was done.”Sargeant was apparently considered the biggest threat to Gething.A friend of Sargeant said: “It does look like this was all orchestrated because a group of people wanted Carl out of government. They took advantage of the whole Sexminster frenzy in Westminster and said ‘Right, what have we got on Carl, how can we sack him? We need a reason to sack him.’ So they concocted it.”All this might go some way to explaining the latest twist in this saga.This week Bernie Sargeant and her son Jack, who successfully stood for election in his father’s Assembly seat of Alyn and Deeside in February, announced they are seeking a judicial review into how the independent inquiry into the death will be run.The inquiry, led by Paul Bowen QC, was announced by Carwyn Jones within days of Sargeant’s death.Its remit is to investigate how Sargeant was treated by the First Minister.Not only has it still not begun, triggering the cover-up claims, The Sargeant family believe they will not be allowed to attend the inquiry and their legal team will not get the chance to cross-examine witnesses, including Carwyn Jones.One friend commented: “First there was a stitch-up, now we’re seeing an attempted cover-up.”The Labour Party refused to comment.Carwyn Jones refused to comment.GOT a story?

This suggests that Hackney have made an error, which they now realise.Mr Ahmed received his first fine on June 18 but claims he wasnt notified of the fine until one month later.In the meantime he had committed another eleven offences.“The penalty charge notices have made me very upset, annoyed, angry, frustrated and stressed, he told the MailOnline.“Theyve also given me insomnia and Ive suffered huge financial loss.Between 7am-10am and 3pm-7pm drivers cannot turn left from Mare Street onto Richmond Road to reduce pollution at a nearby school.But drivers have complained poor signage and a lack of warning about the new restrictions have unfairly hit them in the pockets.The council has already dished out more than 14,000 fines since the restrictions were introduced in June, the Hackney Gazette reports.The fine is £65 if paid within two weeks and doubles after that - with drivers told they could face court action if they fail to pay within a month.RAC spokesman Rod Dennis said: The number of fines being given to drivers at this junction suggests something is wrong - and it might well be that the sheer amount of signage and a difficult road layout is to blame.The sign is immediately past a busy pedestrian crossing and between two sections of bus lane on Mare Street.A driver would have just moments to read all the traffic signs and decide whether they were permitted to turn left.And unlike on a straight section of road, they would have no opportunity to correct the manoeuvre if they then realised their mistake.A review of all the street signage around the junction would also be very welcome.The fines have sparked outrage among drivers on social media.Writing on Twitter, Trajon2000 said: Councillors will be giving themselves a big pat on the back for that, oh and a big payrise.Just a thought here, if they put more of these signs around the borough to catch people out, could we have a council tax reduction please.A Council spokesperson said: “The changes to this junction are part of our pioneering school streets initiative which is improving air quality and making it easier and safer for families to walk and cycle to and from school.“The notices already meet all Department for Transport requirements, and we have now added additional signage to ensure all drivers comply and help make our children’s school journeys healthier.“While it is the responsibility of drivers to read this signage and adhere to the road closures, we will of course listen to representations where a driver feels that a fine has been issued unfairly or received multiple fines during a short period.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000428677143.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may urged to sack philip hammond after his  on a no deal brexit","story":"Furious Tory MPs called on the PM to replace the doom-monger Chancellor with Sajid Javid.The fresh anger against Mr Hammond comes after he published a letter warning of “large fiscal consequences” of leaving the EU without a deal on the same day as Brexit chief Dominic Raab’s presented the positives of no deal.Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith compared the Chancellor’s constant Brexit doom to Mr Ratner, the former millionaire whose jewellery chain collapsed after famously describing his products as “total crap”.He told The Sun: “Any business will tell you if you’re in a position of authority and you spend your whole time telling everybody how rotten things are, then you will deliver a rotten outcome.“So Philip Hammond has become the Gerald Ratner of politics because he has no faith in his country or in his country’s businesses or the people who live in his country and all he can see around him is disaster.”Tory MP Nadine Dorries went a step further - calling on the PM to sack Mr Hammond.She fumed: “Philip Hammond has to go - he’s like a ball and chain around the Prime Minister’s leg and he’s a ball and chain on Brexit.“Everything Philip Hammond does is to prevent or stop Brexit.So the calls to fire Philip Hammond over his disgraceful undermining of the Brexit Secretary are short-sighted.But this Chancellor has shown none of the energy, optimism or vision that job needs as we leave the EU.

If Mr Hammond wants to show he understands that too, and keep his job after next March, he should draw up a tax-cutting Budget now.Not just moan that the sky is falling in.“We need an upbeat, outward looking, asporicational chancellor who wants to embrace Brexit and all it has to offer, not someone who is permanently trying to stop it.“I think Sajid Javid would be a great Chancellor - I think he’s born to be Chancellor.”Another senior Tory said: “There isn’t a single person now in politics who in any way can understand why he’s still there because he’s undermined the Prime Minister on every single turn.“Everyone is astonished that he still exists, he still stays in that position and he seems to be taking a completely different line from her on every given occasion.”No10 also laid bare its frustration at Mr Hammond’s failure to get clearance from the Prime Minister before publishing the letter.A Downing Street source dismissed the analysis as “preliminary and very much a work in progress,” adding: “As we have always said, Britain will ultimately succeed, no matter what our particular relationship is with the EU.”But the PM’s deputy David Lidington defended the Chancellor’s divisive intervention.Mr Lidington claimed Mr Hammond was only trying to be punctual in replying to MPs.And he insisted it was a coincidence that the Chancellor’s letter - which warned a no deal Brexit could wipe ten per cent off Britain’s national income - was sent on the same day as Mr Raab’s long-awaited presentation of Britain’s contingency planning designed to kill off “scare stories”.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250 or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Health and safety rules say employers must protect workers from extended exposure to volumes above 85dB.Anne Scorey, from the BSI, said: “It’s worrying to see that so many Brits are exposing themselves to unsafe levels of noise.It’s down to a widespread misunderstanding around hearing safety, to the extent that some in the survey even believed that listening to music through headphones will negate any risk.We’d urge people to keep an eye out for ear defenders that carry the BSI Kitemark before they start their DIY tasks this weekend.”And Vaitheki Maheswaran, from Action on Hearing Loss, said: Quality ear defenders are an excellent and affordable way to protect your hearing.But Jo Behari, author of The Girls Guide to DIY, said: This is health and safety gone mad.People dont need to dress up like they are doing a day shift on an industrial site just for an odd-job around the house.Guidance like this is likely to put people off doing DIY and adds unnecessary expense.People should not be unnecessarily worried if they are putting up shelves without earmuffs this weekend.The Sun told last year how safety experts wanted kids to wear ear defenders when popping balloons at parties.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their research used GPS measurements over 11 years between 2001 and 2012.Writing in the report Dr Murray and his team said this strong geological evidence of sliding have a natural tendency to result in large catastrophic sector collapse and devastating consequences such as landslides.The data suggests the mountain is moving in an east-south-east direction, down a gentle slope of 1-3 degrees towards the coastal town of Giarre, which is about 15km away.The movement has been put down to underlying platform of weak, pliable sediments.Dr Murray stressed it could take thousands of years to develop to a critical stage.He told the BBC: The 14mm/yr is an average it varies from year to year. The thing to watch I guess is if in 10 years time the rate of movement has doubled - that would be a warning. If its halved, Id say there really is nothing to worry about.Etna erupted in March 2017 injuring eight people covering them with steam and burning boulders.Its most destructive eruption took place in March 1669 and produced lava flows that destroyed at least 10 villages on its southern flank."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1536/skynews-brexit-eu-no-deal-dominic-raab_4398676.jpg?20180823130237 ","title":"corbyn reported to mp standards watchdog over zionist comment","story":"He discussed a speech by the then Palestinian ambassador, Manuel Hassassian, which he says was recorded by \"thankfully silent Zionists\" who then approached the speaker and \"berated\" him.Referring to the \"Zionists\" he says: \"There are two problems, one is they don\u0027t want to study history, and the second is, having lived in this country for a very long time, probably all their lives, they don\u0027t understand English irony either.\"Zionism is the support for the creation of a Jewish homeland in the state of Israel.

Can you hear me at the back? My name is Dominic Raab and I am your stewardess on this flight with Brexit Airways. As you will have been aware at the time you bought your tickets, or in the case of 48% of you were marched at gunpoint on to the plane, our original destination was the Sunlit Uplands of 1974, where we could once again enjoy a 3-day week, a state of emergency in Northern Ireland, and fascists marching in the streets.  Due to unforeseen circumstances entirely within our control but sadly not explained in the literature available to you on the clown bus that drove you to the airport, our pilot Theresa has had to alter our destination. She thinks we\u0027re headed for the Great Famine of 1845, but her co-pilot Philip thinks it\u0027s more likely to be the 1931 financial dustbowl.  Meanwhile Jacob, who some of you may remember from when he used to sit at the back of the plane, has somehow got into the cockpit and having assumed the role of navigator is quoting the Book of Proverbs, and trying to get us all on the right heading for the Glorious Revolution of 1688, by taking us first to the Black Death of 1348 which he believes we would all appreciate a glimpse of. I am aware that in the two hours we\u0027ve been on this plane, which have seemed more like years to many of us, concern has grown among passengers about what exactly will happen when we land and so I have been asked to issue you with instructions about what to do if it turns out the runway we are heading for does not, in fact, exist. Now, I don\u0027t want you to worry, but in the 5 minutes - is that all? Feels like a month - since I was put in charge of the cabin crew I have looked all over the plane and not been able to find any emergency exits. I was wondering if I could ask you now to look around and let me know if you can see any possible escape routes. Just wave at me if you can.    Oh I\u0027m sorry, I forgot your hands were tied. Well, I do have some good news in that a 100% organic meal will be served, just as soon as it is licensed by the airport we are leaving and got through, uh, about 9 months of red tape. On the plus side it will be very cheap as there is a limited market for well-rotted swede, even if swallowing it seems a high price to pay.  On the subject of payment, I\u0027m aware most of you use credit cards to make purchases abroad and there may be higher charges for doing so, depending on where we land exactly, and indeed whether money still forms part of our society at that time. Our stewards are now passing round a hat into which you are all encouraged to put your loose change, house deeds, flexible friends and first-born child if you have one, or somebody else\u0027s if you don\u0027t. Please don\u0027t be alarmed if you have less to put in the hat than your neighbour, because we do have complimentary sandwiches on board and you will still be able to enjoy a BLT once we have landed, and although it might be a little damp and curly by then I can put to rest right now the rumour that we will be asking Her Majesty\u0027s Armed Forces to feed them to you.  All service personnel will instead be asked to stand by the cabin door to deal with 7 times the current volume of border checks on people, services and goods, because we do not have nearly enough customs officials and while we could just wave you all off down the stairs, or inflatable ramp depending on what happens, we think there could be hostile customs officials at our destination who will make things worse if we don\u0027t.    I\u0027ve also been authorised to tell you that we will be recruiting 9,000 extra air traffic controllers to organise our landing , and although we will be running out of fuel in 35 minutes or so I can assure you that will feel more like 7 months, so plenty of time to enjoy the company of loved ones before the rule of law enters a period where we don\u0027t know whose law it will be.  As we have left the European Aviation Safety Agency - I know we all assumed we\u0027d find a way to stay in this, I know I did, but it seems that your previous stewardess David didn\u0027t get the paperwork done before he jumped - the plane and indeed the pilot are no longer insured, which is actually good news as it should bring down the overall cost of any flights you decide to take, if you manage to survive this one. Er, hello sir? Are you wiggling your eyebrows and making those strangled noises to get my attention? Yes, yes, ah right, I understand. For those of you who didn\u0027t hear, this gentleman in the fourth row has indicated that all this is giving him a headache and he\u0027s wondering if there is any aspirin aboard. A few of you may be in a similar situation, particularly in Blairite class where there\u0027s been some headbutting. We carry six aspirin at all times, and aware of a possible delay in supplies we have ordered an extra six aspirin to be stockpiled. These will be brought onto the plane as soon as we make physical contact with the ground, and I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll go a long way towards alleviating the painful injuries some of us may sustain during that process.  Now, I\u0027ve saved the best news til last which is that I have managed to find a parachute in the shape of the World Trade Organisation. It has a simple set of rules which, once we\u0027ve dusted them off, will mean more complicated rules on pretty much everything, more paperwork, more laws for things like credit ratings agencies, and so many rules for stuff like paediatric medicine that actually we\u0027re planning to ignore those completely and just give sick children whatever the hell we can find.  WHOAH! Just a bit of turbulence there, I believe the fact that Boris, our trainee pilot, ran screaming from the cockpit, down the aisle and hauled up a floor panel to interfere with the landing gear just shifted some weight around, but we\u0027ve steadied now. As I was about to say, we have this great parachute, although it turns out that it renders individual trade deals impossible, it requires the building of a brick wall covered in barbed wire in Northern Ireland, and in fact the WTO hasn\u0027t actually agreed we can use it so I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m even mentioning it.  You should really stop weeping, and try to be more like Mr Corbyn here who is calmly suggesting alterations to the in-flight magazine, and who despite sitting nearest to the cockpit is making no effort at all to seize control of it.  Oh, and I forgot to say, but those of you who are British ex-pats may not be able to access your bank accounts after we land. Anyone who needs the services of a sperm donor will find that a lot more difficult too. On this last count, I understand Boris has offered to masturbate for free if the Daily  will report on it.

Deputy leader Tom Watson will call for a new regulator and tougher sanctions to police the “wild west” of the internet. He accuses the companies of not removing fake news stories that are “spread\u0026shying like wildfire”, and being too lax on harassment and bullying. Mr Watson will say Britain should follow the lead of Germany, which fines social media firms up to \u0026pound45million for not taking down hate speech within 24 hours.  He thinks No10 is dragging its feet and the UK should consider creating a commissioner to hold tech firms responsible for abuse on their sites. Mr Watson will say the likes of Facebook and Twitter have refused to change, adding: “Authorities worldwide don’t have the baby teeth, let alone the sharp teeth, to make them take notice. International regulatory regimes are outdated and dangerous.” Responsibility for overseeing social media here is shared by Ofcom, the Advertising Standards Authority and the Information Commissioner’s Office.

But wait, it\u0027s not over yet, we\u0027ve got one last bank holiday to go and it\u0027s really worth being prepared for it. By this point, we\u0027ve all had enough of cowering from the heatwave sun so the end-of-summer cooldown is most welcome. That means it’s the ideal time to get out and enjoy some activities. Below we\u0027ve pulled together some great ideas for making the most out of the last bank holiday before Christmas... Get out on a family cycling adventure  If you\u0027ve been putting off taking the kids out to practise cycling, this last bank holiday is the ideal time to get out for a ride. Head out to some quiet woodland, or check out the Halfords widget below to find your nearest cycling route.   If you want to head further afield, then don\u0027t forget that it\u0027s easy enough to add a bike rack to your car.  The Thule ProRide 591 Roof Mount Bike Carrier (above) is \u0026pound75 (save \u0026pound35) and useful because you can add more than one to a roof rack - making it perfect for growing families. Halfords also sell a wide range of roof racks - and will fit them for you too. Enjoy a camping trip to Scotland  One of the great things about Scotland - aside from the stunning countryside - is freedom to roam. It means camping is allowed on public, unenclosed, land for no more than two or three nights. Your other option is to visit one of the many existing campsites across the country, such as at Loch Lomond (try Ardlui), Loch Ness (consider Borlum), or one of the many along the coast (check out Clachtoll Beach Campsite at Sutherland).  For camping, we suggest the Halfords 4 Person Double Skin Tent (above) which is now just \u0026pound40, save \u0026pound60, and takes just 15 minutes to pitch. If you\u0027re driving with all your camping gear, you\u0027ll also want to consider boot space.  It\u0027s surprising how much stuff you need to take the kids away for a couple of nights and you don\u0027t want to be uncomfortable in the car.  For added space, grab the Exodus 470L Black Roof Box Fully Fitted Bundle (above) from Halfords. It\u0027s \u0026pound389 (save \u0026pound98) and includes the fitting and a roof rack suitable for your car. Find the perfect spot for a picnic  Take a picnic out with you and you\u0027ll have everything you need for a great day out. You could even pack the Halfords Portable Gas Stove (below), which is now \u0026pound8 (save \u0026pound12). But don\u0027t forget to pick up the correct Campingaz CP250 (A4) Gas Cartridge to go with it - these are just \u0026pound2 each or four for \u0026pound5.  Just make sure you\u0027re allowed to cook at your destination – many beaches only allow barbeques and small stoves after most people have gone home.

The UK\u0027s summer heatwave is also believed to be behind an increase in the spread of the infection syphilis, with more people being sexually active in the warm weather.  Doctors believe the reason behind the steep rise could be an increase in people using online dating apps to meet up for unprotected sex.  They say people deleting their partners\u0027 profiles afterwards prevents them from warning them if they are diagnosed with an infection later on. As a result, many could be unaware if they have an infection.  Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board has seen five times as many people diagnosed with syphilis in the last four months compared to same period last year. Since April there have been 56 confirmed cases of the infection in Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend - with 16 of those coming in the last two weeks alone. Most of the patients have been men, but several women have also tested positive. Symptoms for syphilis can include small painless sores or ulcers, blotchy red rashes, small skin growths or white patches in the mouth.   It may also cause tiredness, headaches , joint pains and swollen glands, but some people may experience no symptoms at all.  If left untreated the infection can spread to the brain or other parts of the body, causing serious and long-term problems. The health board, in South Wales, are urging people to contact sexual health clinic if they have had unprotected sex in recent months.

Scotland Yard have launched their 100th homicide investigation in the capital this year after the pensioner was found dead. Officers say Carole Harrison’s body was discovered in her house in leafy Teddington, south west London, following a blaze in the early hours of Wednesday. The Met Police say the 73-year-old had suffered injuries “consistent with an assault”. The mother of five lived alone after her late husband Terry, a bus driver, died 22 years ago.  According to neighbours, her son Christopher lives in a nursing home while Ian lives nearby and regularly visited her. Her other son Stuart visits from time to time. Carole also has two daughters and is estranged from one of them. Her family said in a statement issued by police: She was a loving mother and caring person who dedicated most of her life to nursing in the NHS and private care homes. She really was a grandmother with character and will be deeply missed for her unique cheeky laugh and comical character. Due to the illness she suffered from, she trusted anyone that she met, sought friendship in many people and was known for being somewhat generous at times. Her illness could make her frustrated at times too.  This is a very difficult time for us and we appreciate that there is an ongoing Police investigation and we would ask anyone who knows anything that could help with the investigation to please contact the police. Particularly if anyone saw her on Tuesday, 21 August. If you have ANY information please contact the police immediately on 0208 721 4622. We ask that our privacy during this difficult time is respected by all.\u0027 A neighbour who knew the retired nurse said Carole had recently “inherited a large sum of money” and hoped to buy a property with the funds. The woman, who did not wish to be named, said: “Carole was telling everybody she had money. She even came to me and said she had come across money.  “She was going around telling people and told me that she had lost a brother and sister and she was getting half the value of their home. “I think it was very unlikely that she had it.” Neighbour Flo Osmond, 75, claimed she had a “habit of inviting people in that she didn’t know” She added: “She really did not know what she was doing”. Another neighbour said Carole also worked in a local launderette four decades ago. Close friends claimed she wanted to buy a new home with the money she believed she would inherit.

They play a key role in police and fire services up and down the country, and their bravery and unique skills and abilities have helped save hundreds of lives. When devastating or tragic events occur, they are called in to check the scene and to search for survivors.  And to help them stay safe when they\u0027re risking their lives, service dogs are given these very important - and also very cute - boots to wear.   Dogs are never sent into an active blaze, but they are sent into the scene after it has been extinguished. The shoes are designed to protect the dogs\u0027 feet from any debris which has been left, including shards of glass and wood. Watch manager and fire investigation officer Paul Osborne is the proud keeper of search dog Sherlock. The five-year-old working Cocker Spaniel wears the shoes when he\u0027s at work in the London Fire Service. Paul told Mirorr Online: A dog will do anything for its owner and will put itself in harm\u0027s way.  It\u0027s our job to make sure that when that dog is deployed it has as much safety equipment as possible. However the shoes aren\u0027t used every time a dog is sent in to investigate a scene. When they arrive, their handler will assess the scene to see if the shoes are needed. Paul explained: The boots reduce their effectiveness. It\u0027s one of their senses, their sense of touch. By putting what are essentially bags on their feet it does mask them somewhat. But if there is any potential that the dog could be harmed, that\u0027s when the boots go on. Service dogs are introduced to the boots at a young age so they can get used to wearing them.  Paul said: I can only describe it as a dog with rollerskates on. They are just like, \u0027what an Earth are you putting on me\u0027. But before long Sherlock got used to them. Paul added: He\u0027s been absolutely fine with them. He tends to wear them with pride and show them off.  Sherlock is one of the London Fire Dogs, and the groups was named the winner of the Public Service Animal category of the Mirror\u0027s Animal Hero Awards 2017 .  The dogs, wearing their special shoes, were recognised for their bravery after they entered Grenfell Tower after the tragic blaze last year.

Her mum Julia is there teaching her big brother John to play her banjo with its mother-of-pearl back, or John is  practising the guitar with his mates Paul and George in the kitchen as she and her sister Jackie jig about.   Her brother – a half-brother – was of course Beatles legend John Lennon .  That is breathtakingly clear when you see Julia’s face, with the same slim nose and pointed chin, now lined, giving a glimpse, spellbinding and heartbreaking, of how he might have looked today.   Her visits to that house in Allerton’s Springwood estate in Liverpool are bittersweet. Her mum and brother are long gone – Julia killed in a car accident in 1958 and John assassinated by Mark Chapman in New York in December 1980. Chapman was this week refused freedom at his 10th parole hearing.  Julia prefers not to talk about him. Even speaking of John’s death is still acutely painful for her. It could also hurt that John’s legacy is everywhere but the former teacher explains she has found embracing it is better than running away. “There is no escape,” she says. “And there is no point in pretending. It would hurt more to pretend I had nothing to do with him.”   What helps is the memory of those joyous early years before tragedy struck, the time when a teenage John first met Paul McCartney and George Harrison and invited them to join his band The Quarrymen.  It is 60 years since they made their first record with Percy Phillips’ Sound Recording Services. It was a rendition of Buddy Holly’s That’ll Be The Day and an original, In Spite of All The Danger. Two years later they became The Beatles. The record features in The Percy Phillips Studio Collection, which Julia will help launch tomorrow at the Beatles Convention in Liverpool.   Julia has taken on a directorship at the Cavern Club, where The Beatles played in their early years, but admits she never got to see them play there.  “We weren’t allowed at the Cavern. I was 14, but looked like a 10-year-old, and the bus home only went to Penny Lane after 9.20pm. Woe betide you if you missed it because you had to walk a few miles.”  But in 1964 she and sister Jackie went to see The Beatles at the Finsbury Park Astoria in London. Julia says: “The curtain went up and it was instant mayhem, I hated it. “They all rushed to the front and John is doing I Love You and he’s going, ‘Get the girls’. We were hauled on our stomachs back to the curtains. But I saw them in the kitchen often enough. And at home in our kitchen, where John was truly himself. “That kitchen is where it all happened.”  From the age of five, John had actually lived with his strict Aunt Mimi, his mother Julia’s sister. His mum had split from his dad, merchant seaman Alfred Lennon, who rarely returned from sea and was living with Bobby Dykins with whom she had her two daughters Julia and Jackie. John went to live with Mimi because, Julia says, she disapproved of her mother’s unmarried life with Bobby. But John always visited and was close to his younger sisters. Julia, 71, almost snaps when asked if he was different from other lads. She wants to stress their normality. “He was no different from any older brother on the road,” she says.  Sitting in Liverpool’s Hard Day’s Night Hotel, her brother’s voice on loop, she recalls the day of the church fete in Woolton in 1957 where John is said to have met Paul McCartney. The Quarrymen were playing and Paul just happened to come along. “It was a brilliant day, beautiful sunshine,” Julia says. “We met John at Woolton village, they were getting on the coal lorries that had been scrubbed, not entirely clean, him and his Quarrymen. “John sat at the end of the lorry. He was playing and Jackie and I went and grabbed a leg each to try and get him off. He was laughing his head off.” Then rehearsals began in earnest, with Paul joining The Quarrymen and then his younger pal, George Harrison. “I first met Paul in our kitchen,” says Julia. “He started coming round a lot. We all danced to Elvis and skiffle.”  The next year, days after The Quarrymen had recorded their first tracks, John and Julia’s mum was killed, struck by a car being driven by an off-duty police officer. Dealing with their loss as Beatlemania spiralled was tough. Julia says: “We were still suffering and then this huge thing was parallel. We all learned to separate things off in boxes.” Initially, John kept his little sisters close and Julia clearly remembers him coming home in 1964. “John slept on the floor in the front room. He wasn’t going to stay in a posh hotel in town.”  She also has fond memories of the Finsbury Park Astoria concert that year, laughing: “The Rolling Stones were in the dressing room so we knew they’d made it. They were all friends, drinking Coca-Cola – probably heavily laced.” She also recalls visiting John when he and first wife, Cynthia, moved with their son Julian to Surrey. Julia says: “We were opening fan letters and replying, ‘Yes, I will marry you, I’ll meet you at the church tomorrow’.” But after John moved to New York with Yoko Ono in 1971, they lost touch. In 1974, Julia finally received a phone call. They spoke for four hours. She says: “There was a lot of laughing and a lot of crying. He said, ‘Describe the room you’re in,’ and I said, ‘There are photos of Mummy and you and Jackie all round the walls’, and he said, ‘Send them to me’. So I stripped the walls.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum sends kids shop buy","story":"NewsMum sends kids to the shop to buy milk - but they come back with something very cheeky insteadThe mischievous children couldn\u0027t wait to show their mum what they had bought on their shopping tripShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsBySarah Scott22:49, 24 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum was left speechless after her children came back from the shops with something completely different from what she had asked them to buy.

The distressed animals were seen on film being “aggressively handled” by staff at dairies belonging to Coombe Farm in Somerset, which supplies organic products to Waitrose and is RSPCA Assured. After receiving a tip-off about cruel handling, undercover footage was obtained by welfare charity Animal Equality in June and July this year. Coombe Farm boasts of high animal welfare standards and says on its website: “We believe that well-cared-for, relaxed dairy herds produce better milk and that this will be appreciated by the people who drink it.” But the charity claims that when it visited the farm on many occasions it found calves being force-fed and aggressively handled.  The creatures were allegedly denied water for over 24 hours on some of the hottest days of the year. A newborn was dragged by its legs and staff swore at and hit the animals. Several cows were seen with back legs shackled. In the footage, a worker appears to place his foot on a calf’s head after putting a stomach tube down its throat. He is then heard saying “You f***ing s***”as he squats down on the calf while its mother looks on. In another incident, a worker enters the pen as a calf is suckling from its mother. The calf is pulled away and a tube forced down its throat. One staff member was filmed dragging a calf by its hind legs, breaking RSPCA guidelines which state that animals must not be pulled or lifted by their tails, ears or limbs.  Cows were also filmed with their hind legs shackled. The practise is not illegal and is sometimes used to stop cows slipping to prevent injury. But DEFRA does not recommend it and it is condemned by many animal welfare charities. Dr Toni Shephard, executive director of Animal Equality, says: “Far from preventing injury, shackles help facilitate a farming system that works animals to the point of collapse. They simply enable farmers to squeeze every last drop of milk out of these poor worn-out mothers before they go to slaughter.” The charity also claims the calves were left without drinking water for more than 24 hours on days when temperatures soared over 30C. Dr Shephard says: “Consumers will be shocked to see such cruel treatment of tiny newborn calves with their heartbroken mothers forced to look on.  “These harrowing scenes are far from the much-romanticised [idea of an] organic farm. “The workers seen doing the force-feeding have no compassion or empathy with the newborn calves and should not continue to be employed on the farm. “But senior management also needs to be held accountable for inadequate training and supervision.” One of the UK’s leading experts on dairy cow and calf welfare, Prof John Webster of Bristol University’s Veterinary School, reviewed the footage. He slammed the “cruel” way the calves are being given colostrum – the type of milk they are being force-fed.  Prof Webster said: “Not only are the calves treated roughly and with a total absence of compassion, but it is easier to deliver colostrum by stomach tube when calves are gently restrained in a standing position with their heads inclined as they would be for sucking. “This is a reasonably affluent farm where the senior management has the knowledge required to promote good practice. “However, there appears to be a huge gulf between the management and the stockmen, who would appear to have received neither training nor supervision in the humane care of newborn calves.” "},{"url":null,"title":"oscar chihuahua dogs lavish eighth","story":"NewsOscar the chihuahua dog\u0027s lavish eighth birthday party cost £5,000 - and this is whySurrey-based Dazzle \u0026 Fizz organised the party for Oscar and his ten canine friends in London - this is what happenedShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAmy Coles13:34, 24 AUG 2018NewsLizzie Lewis treated Oscar and ten of his canine friends to nibbles in his image (Image: Dazzle \u0026amp Fizz / Instagram)Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBirthdays are a big deal when you are eight years old.

Instead of subjecting him to painful surgery, Charlie Proctor \u0027s parents have decided to focus on making \u0027magical memories\u0027 with their son.   The five-year-old has been fighting a rare form of the disease since 2016 and his mum and dad, Amber Schofeld and Ben Proctor, have been trying to raise \u0026pound300,000 for specialist treatment in America.  But, having recently been told it will actually cost more than \u0026pound850,000, Charlie\u0027s parents now face a heartbreaking reality. In an emotional Facebook post, Amber wrote: Our baby might not make Christmas because of money.  Amber and Ben have accepted the chemotherapy he is currently on will not cure him. Instead, it will make him extremely poorly. Acknowledging this, they have decided to cancel planned surgery to install a new Hickman line - a catheter most often used for the administration of chemotherapy.  Amber, who lives in Accrington, Lancashire, announced the news on Charlie\u0027s Facebook fundraising page , which she set up after his diagnosis.  She wrote: As much as it tears our hearts to bits we have to face reality, we have to see what is best for Charlie. We know he would rather make some magical memories whilst he can than keep making him poorly with treatment that isn\u0027t going to save him.  Tomorrow me and Ben will be going to Manchester hospital on our own to pick up Charlie\u0027s end of life oral chemo that he will take at home. This won\u0027t cure him but it will slow down the growth of his cancer without the horrible side effects so he can still be him. Charlie, who is big brother to sister Jessica, was diagnosed with liver cancer in at the start of 2016, after suffering a bug over Christmas. Doctors initially gave him a 90 per cent of survival, but chemotherapy did not work as they hoped and last month tests revealed more tumours had grown on his liver.   Even though Ben and Amber have stopped their efforts to raise money, they are still accepting donations on their JustGiving page .   They wrote: Fundraising has’t stopped, I\u0027ve asked for no more events as there is no time. Donations only, in hope someone wealthy can donate.   Amber and Ben\u0027s post in full With a heavy heart I have to now let you all know the devastating news. Saturday morning we received the cost estimate and with a liver transplant needed this time the price for Charlie\u0027s life, for him to have a future would be $1.1 million. We realise we could never raise this in time and therefore are stopping all fundraising events. They are too much time and effort for a small amount of what we now need. The chemotherapy Charlie is on isn\u0027t going to cure him, yes it\u0027s slowing the growth down but it also makes him so poorly to the point it will kill him. Yesterday morning we woke up in hospital ready to get his new Hickman line.  After a late night talk, me and Ben both feel it’s best to not put him through surgery for a Hickman line for something that isn\u0027t going to help. As much as it tears our hearts to bits we have to face reality, we have to see what is best for Charlie. We know he would rather make some magical memories whilst he can than keep making him poorly with treatment that isn’t going to save him.

The BBC programme originally aired in the 1960s has not been seen for almost 50 years. \u0027Royal Family\u0027 was created by Richard Cawston for the BBC and, much like reality TV shows of today, a film crew followed the family for 18 months. Footage included scenes like chatter across the breakfast table and Prince Charles in his younger years. But after the Queen gave her consent to the 38 hours of footage, according to the Express , she later decided the film pushed personal boundaries and ordered it to be kept hidden in the BBC vaults.  The two-hour documentary was aired on June 21, 1969, with 37 million viewers settling down to watch. But it was not just the Queen who decided against the footage, Princess Anne also turned her nose up. She later admitted: I never liked the idea of \u0027Royal Family\u0027, I thought it was a rotten idea. She added: The attention which had been brought upon one ever since one was a child, you just didn\u0027t need any more. Michael Bradsell, the film\u0027s editor, revealed he was initially hesitant about sharing his work with Her Majesty. We were all a little bit nervous of showing it to the Queen because we had no idea what she would make of it, he told Smithsonian Channel, who uploaded a clip of the documentary on YouTube. She was a little critical of the film in the sense she thought it was too long, but Dick Cawston, the director, persuaded her two hours was not a minute too long.  In a new ABC show, The Story of the Royals, experts have debated why the footage was banished. Some people say that this would open the floodgates, and therefore after that all the sort of tabloid interest in them [would come after], said royal biographer Hugo Vickers. They would want to know more, and more, and more. Robert Lacey, historical consultant on Netflix show The Crown, explained: They realised that if they did something like that too often, they would cheapen themselves, letting the magic seep out.

Maximum temperatures in Celsius are set to plunge into the high teens by Sunday, with parts of the country expected to be battered by near gale-force winds. Drivers are being warned to expect delays as more than 14 million cars take to the roads for leisure trips between Thursday and Monday, according to the RAC. Met Office meteorologist Simon Partridge said wet and windy weather could cause further trouble for those travelling over the last long weekend before the festive period.  In places we are quite likely to see some standing water on the roads which will add to the difficult driving conditions on Sunday, he said. Some areas could see winds of between 30mph to 40mph, so a wet and windy day.

On Saturday the M1 is predicted to be badly affected from junction 22 to junction 25 in the East Midlands, with typical journey times increasing from 16 minutes to 62 minutes.  Motorists\u0027 frustrations with the congestion could be heightened by the knowledge that fuel prices stand at a four-year high, with Government figures showing the average cost of a litre of petrol is \u0026pound1.29, while diesel is \u0026pound1.33. Engineering work on the railways means a number of routes are disrupted. Network Rail is urging passengers not to travel on the West Coast Main Line to and from London between Saturday and Monday as London Euston is closed. People who do travel between north-west England and the capital risk journeys that are far longer, busier and less comfortable than normal, the Government-owned company warned. London Euston, the UK\u0027s fifth busiest station, will also be closed during the following weekend, as work to replace a junction in Wembley continues.  Network Rail route managing director Martin Frobisher said: There is never an ideal time to shut the railway but these weekends are the least disruptive times to do it. Engineering work will also disrupt some services to Manchester, Birmingham International and Derby. Blustery showers in the north and west moved south-east on Friday, bringing a cool night for the UK, with some grass frost in Scotland on Saturday morning.

The chain, which has pubs and hotels across the country, said there would be no dogs allowed after September 10 in any of its branches.  A JD Wetherspoon spokesman revealed that the group\u0027s hard-working staff had grown tired of picking up poop, reports Somerset Live .  And the company said it had been lenient with dog owners in recent years but would be strictly prohibiting all pooches from now.  Announcing the news, a statement from Wetherspoons said: Please note that Wetherspoon has a policy of not allowing dogs in its pubs, including all outside areas. (Assistance Dogs excepted).   This policy was introduced shortly after the company was founded in 1979, although in recent years we have allowed a few exceptions. After much consultation, we will now be strictly enforcing this policy everywhere. In order to give those affected time to adjust we have set a deadline of Monday, September 10, 2018.  Wetherspoons, founded in 1979 by Tim Martin , has just under 1,000 outlets around the country.   The exception to the rule is assistance dogs who will be allowed inside and beer gardens. Spokesman Eddie Gershon added: Even well behaved dogs can be unpredictable, every dog owner thinks their dog is perfect. We welcome a lot of children and families and younger children in particular can be unpredictable around dogs and many are scared of dogs. We serve a lot of food. Unfortunately not all owners are diligent over cleaning up dog mess.

North America correspondent James Cook was doing a radio report on the storm when there was a loud creak following by a huge crash. He is in the middle of describing the route of the storm, which has since been downgraded to Category 2, when the tree falls. James can be heard groaning, and people rush to his aid.  When asked if he\u0027s okay, James replies: I\u0027m alright, I\u0027m alright. Yeah. I\u0027m fine. That was unexpected. He then asks people not to move the branch, explaining it will be easier for him just to climb out. James escaped with no injuries, but his laptop was destroyed by the impact. He can be heard saying: It smashed my laptop. This afternoon the hurricane was downgraded to a Category 2 story. Maximum sustained winds are now near 110mph with higher gusts.  The US National Weather Service said some weakening is expected throughout the rest of the day, but the hurricane is expected to remain dangerous as it approaches Hawaii\u0027s islands. Hurricane warnings are in effect for the islands of Oahu, Maui, Lanai, Molokai and Kahoolawe. Hawaii\u0027s Big Island has a tropical storm warning. The service said Lane\u0027s centre will move dangerously close to some Hawaiian islands later today. Police warned tourists to leave the world-famous Waikiki Beach after nearly 2ft of rain. So far, about 1,500 people, mostly on Oahu, are in emergency shelters, said Brad Kieserman of the American Red Cross. Emergency crews rescued five California tourists from a home they were renting in Hilo after a nearby gulch overflowed and flooded the house.

The Facebook post described his high maintenance traits including how he loves to be petted while he eats, he only drinks water from a separate room to where his food is, and how he likes the sides of his face to be scratched. A staggering total of 161 adoption applications came in for Bruno, who has extra toes and a habit of standing on his hind legs. And Bruno was finally adopted on Tuesday by 29-year-old Lauren Paris and her boyfriend Jason Bartlett in Chicago.   When I saw a photo of Bruno that had been shared on Facebook I just...freaked, Lauren told BuzzFeed News.  It was this wild combination of an excited laugh/cry.

After catching the attention of the shelter, Lauren got to meet Bruno and said it was love at first sight. And as the adoption was finalised, she was pictured crying with joy.

Shayna Hubers, 27, from Kentucky, sobbed in court during her murder trial on Tuesday after she was accused of \u0027cackling\u0027 as she shot Ryan Poston six times. The incident happened after she discovered her boyfriend was due to meet Miss Ohio 2012 for a date in October 2012. Hubers claims she acted in self defence and their relationship was wrought with abuse. According to Cincinnati\u0027s FOX 19, she said in her testimony: I remember thinking that he had a strong personality. I feared him. I felt like I needed to do what he was telling me to do.  In one incident, Hubers said Poston threw her out of a flat onto a porch and when she tried to get back inside, Hubers said that Poston repeatedly slammed the door on her body. The pair had been dating on and off for one-and-a-half years.  Cellmates Dona Dooley, Holly Vivens and Cecily Miller said she had laughed as she told them she gave Poston the \u0027nose job he always wanted\u0027. Their testimony was similar to that at her first trial in 2015, which found her guilty of murder only for the verdict to be thrown out because one of the jurors had a prior felony conviction. Nivens also said she overheard Hubers on the phone to her mum saying that Poston\u0027s family was rich enough to buy another son.  Dooley said: She would get on the phone and cry and sing to her mum and say there\u0027s worse crimes than murder. The prosecution summoned a forensics expert, who said Poston had been shot first in the forehead, twice in the back from three feet away while still seated, and a further three times in his torso from the same distance while he lay on the floor. Highland Heights Police Chief bill Birkenhauer said Hubers would log onto Poston\u0027s Facebook and block women.  He added that she bombarded him with a hundred texts for every one he would send after their regular break-ups. After the first trial, Hubers was sentenced to 40 years in prison without early parole on the account of showing no remorse.  Cambell Country Circuit Judge Fred Stine labelled the killing as cold-blooded an act as I\u0027ve seen.

Thomas Cook customers staying at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada have been offered alternative accommodation following the sudden deaths of John and Susan Cooper on Tuesday.  The cause of death for the Burnley couple is unknown with the travel agent saying they were \u0027aware\u0027 of speculation it could have been carbon monoxide poisoning. However shortly after midday on Friday they said there was no evidence to suggest that theory.  Meanwhile reports from the hospital say dozens of guests have been ill with food poisoning amid reports of undercooked food.   Up to 40 guests are said to have been \u0027on their knees\u0027 with the illness. Hotel guest Alison Cope, from Moseley, Birmingham, said she has been at the hotel for two weeks, and five out of seven of her family members have been ill for around 10 days. The 44-year-old, who flies home on Friday evening, told the Press Association that other guests had been ill, saying: The food is just disgusting, it\u0027s undercooked. I know so many people have been ill. Half the time we don\u0027t know what it is and can\u0027t eat it because it\u0027s raw in the middle. We\u0027ve spent almost two weeks at a five-star hotel eating bread and chips because we at least know what it is.  It had been reported that Mr Cooper, who ran his own building company in Burnley, Lancashire, had a heart attack and was rushed to hospital where he later passed away. However his daughter Kelly Ormerod, who had been on holiday with her parents and her three children, said she watched the 69-year-old die in the hotel. His wife Mrs Cooper, a long-serving Thomas Cook employee, was rushed to hospital but also later passed away.  Previous guests say they have developed serious food-related health conditions, including skin conditions and stomach bugs, during their visit to the luxury five-star hotel on Egypt\u0027s Red Sea. Ayesha Carson went for a week-long stay with her family and a friend in February 2016 and says she developed stomach problems just days into her dream holiday. I was extremely ill when I left this hotel and had horrendous sickness for months, she told the Mirror, adding that her friend and brother also developed a stomach bug. She branded the food hygiene as terrible. Upon arriving home, Ayesha visited hospital and was told she was suffering from gastroenteritis by doctors.  She says she still sufferers from symptoms of the debilitating condition - more than two years after her ordeal - and claims Thomas Cook ignored her complaints following her holiday. Carly Sutton said she and her partner developed diarrhoea within hours of arrival at the resort in December 2017. She sought medical attention and was prescribed a steroid injection by a hotel pharmacist to deal with a rash that just developed. She told Thomas Cook that the hotel needs to be seriously be looked into and claimed she met others who had experienced the same symptoms. She witnessed the young daughter of a family friend projectile vomiting and said the child developed the same irritable skin condition that she had sought medical treatment for. Her experiences ruined what was meant to be a family getaway with her two kids.  Sue Robinson described similar symptoms of food poisoning during a trip with her husband and claims she witnessed children vomiting in the hotel\u0027s main reception. Thomas Cook said they are removing 300 customers from the Egypt hotel as a precautionary measure. In a statement, the travel company said: We are deeply saddened by the tragic deaths of two of our customers who were staying in the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada, Egypt.      The circumstances of their deaths remain unclear. We are aware of the speculation in some of today’s media that their deaths may have been caused by carbon monoxide poisoning. Currently we have no evidence to support this.

The iconic volcano appears to have reawakened in spectacular fashion as streams of scorching molten rock illuminated the Sicilian countryside on Thursday . Mount Etna has lain largely dormant for two years but began emitting signs of life in July, according to Italy\u0027s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology. No residents have been evacuated and the affected area appears limited following the explosions. At 10,926ft, Mount Etna is Europe\u0027s tallest peak south of the Alps and remains one of Sicily\u0027s most popular tourist destinations and attracts thousands of hikers on its peaks every year.  Although it has not been active recently, the volcano has been known to erupt sporadically, sometimes lasting for months and even years.  Last year, a group of tourists and a BBC film crew suffered burns and head injuries following a huge explosion of lava.   Around eight people have been injured by steam and boiling rocks suddenly erupting from the volcano .  Mountain rescue teams were sent in to save at least one group and treat the injured, including a BBC journalist who live-tweeted from the scene after her team ran down the mountain to escape.

Svetlana Evai, 15, managed to avoid bears and wolves as she wandered around the remote area in north Russia trying to find her way home. The schoolgirl’s survival has been hailed a “miracle” as it also emerged she survived freezing temperatures overnight while she was only seven miles from her family home. From a nomadic family of reindeer herders, Svetlana got lost and disoriented on a four mile walk from her summer camp to visit her brother.  A rescue team arrived on the remote Gydan Peninsula - one of the most remote spots in the world - after three days - but it took another 12 days to find her despite being only a few miles away. Hope had been running out for finding her alive with night temperatures dipping to freezing point in the late summer. Her family feared she had been attacked by brown bears which were seen roaming in the region. In the end her uncle found her suffering from exposure but “walking towards him”, said her aunt Irina Yar.  “When she went missing, people were worried because the bears are roaming very close,” said one source.  She was airlifted to hospital by a search helicopter, reported The Siberian Times .  The girl survived on wild cranberries, black and red currents, and cloudberries - which were mostly unripe. Despite suffering from exposure medics said ‘her vital organs are safe’ and ‘there is no threat to her life’. “Her blood pressure and heart beat are stable,” said Eldar Faradjev, chief doctor of Tazovsky central hospital.  During her ordeal, temperatures veered from almost freezing at night to a high of 27C. But she got wet in the thawing permafrost, suffering leg and knee injuries from crawling.

The brand\u0027s Naked palettes have been dubbed the iPhone of make-up and are beloved by many for their nude and golden shades. Various knock off versions of the palettes have popped up in stores since they were first launched in 2010. And it seems that in future you may have to consider buying a dupe instead of the real thing, because Urban Decay have just dropped a massive bombshell.  The company announced today that they are discontinuing their original Naked palette. Yep, I\u0027m sorry to say, you read that right. It\u0027s not 100 per cent clear why this decision has been made, but the palette\u0027s creator, Wende Zomnir, said it was essential for the company to always evolve and that they would turn the grief into greatness. In a statement, Urban Decay added: Today the beauty world mourns Urban Decay\u0027s beloved Naked Palette , the product that revolutionized neutral eyeshadows.  A little bit naughty, often dramatic, and always in the press, the innovative game-changer and category creator will be laid to rest after eight years, without a smudge of regret. Passionate Naked collectors - and pretty much anyone with eyes - will remember Naked as the beauty product that changed their lids forver. It was beautiful and mythical and millions of superfans, from misfits to moms to models, will miss Naked from Virgin to Gunmetal. Urban Decay have even gone as far as to hold a funeral for the palette, which they said took place in Newport Beach in California on August 23. Beauty influencers such as Kandee Johnson, Christen Dominique, Katy DeGroot, Shayla Mitchell, and Chrisspy attended to pay their respects to Naked, while the eulogy was read by Nicole Richie .  Make-up fans on twitter have also been mourning the loss of the product. One wrote: A moment of silence please for the OG eyeshadow palette that started it all. So long Urban Decay Naked Palette. Another commented: So sad Urban Decay is getting rid of their OG Naked palette that palette will forever remind me of all the times I used it while getting ready to go out with my bestie during our college days. A third posted: I’m still in shock. The Naked Palette is what put them on the map in my opinion. The world really IS coming to an end.

is a youth academy product at the London club and spent the first half of the 2016/17 season on loan at Gillingham before picking up an injury that ruled him out for the remainder of that season.Dundee are on the lookout for defensive reinforcements with former skipper Darren O’Dea expected to leave in this transfer window and Steven Caulker’s future decidedly unclear.Manager Neil McCann has made it clear he’s still in the market for new faces to bolster his squad, particularly after a poor showing last week as they crashed out of the Betfred Cup at home to Ayr United.He said: “We’re not done with our recruitment.“I always said I would like to add one or two boys to the squad, I do believe we are a wee bit light in terms of numbers.“That’ll be dictated to by finances, always will be.“I’m delighted about signing Benjamin Kallman last week and I thank the board, John (Nelms) and Tim (Keyes), for making that happen because it took a bit of work to get him in.“I think the fans were getting a bit impatient but we’ve been working so hard and we’ll always do our homework.”n Dundee Colts’ Irn-Bru Cup clash with their Motherwell counterparts has been arranged for

","title":"im going nowhere insists dundee ace glen kamara","story":"\t\t\t\t\tGlen Kamara says he’s “definitely” staying at Dundee to help them pick up the wins to put their poor start to the season behind them.The Finnish international has been the subject of plenty of speculation over the summer with clubs like Swansea and Wolves credited with an interest and  Sunderland having made an enquiry over his availability.With the English transfer window having shut, the number of clubs able to stump up the transfer fee to prise away the Dark Blues’ prize asset has dwindled.And that’s good news for fans at Dens Park as the team have struggled in recent weeks with Kamara stuck in the treatment room with a troublesome ankle problem.He said: “I’ll definitely be here at the end of the month, 100%.“I want to stay and play games, win games and that’s the plan.“Hopefully, I can help the team do that.“It’s been difficult sitting on the sidelines – I’ve hated every minute of it watching from the stands!“Hopefully, I’m back into it soon, I’m feeling fit.”Kamara made his return to action under testing circumstances.The midfielder came on seconds after Sofien Moussa’s dismissal with his side a goal down to Ayr United.And things got even worse as the Honest Men knocked in another two goals to seal their place in the last eight of the Betfred Cup.Looking back at an abject team display, Kamara was almost lost for words.He did, though, find these ones: “Where do you start?“We knew Ayr would be a decent team and have some decent players, they’d be organised and difficult to beat so it wasn’t a surprise.“All the boys were second best on Saturday. We’ve got to give Ayr some credit but the defeat was down to us. We weren’t at it at all.“We knew their qualities and had watched them so it wasn’t about under-estimating them.“We just didn’t create enough and were second best for the whole game.“It might be a lesson for some of the new guys, the league is tough and you need to be ready every game.“I don’t even know what to say, to be honest – it’s a hard one to take and we have to pick ourselves up for a big game this weekend at St Johnstone.“We need three points there.”Focus turns completely to the league campaign now after the Betfred Cup disappointment and what has now become a huge game at St Johnstone.The Dark Blues picked up three wins from four against their Tayside rivals last campaign, including a much-needed first victory of the season.That came in mid-September – this time around Kamara is keen to help the side repeat that 3-2 victory by grabbing a first three points of the season.He added: “Hopefully we can repeat that.“We’ll just do our stuff on the training pitches for the week coming up and put our attention now on St Johnstone but we definitely have to look back on the game on Saturday, we can’t just forget about that performance.“There are always other games and it’s a long season ahead but it’s really hard to go out of the cup like that.“We’re always after a cup run so it’s a tough one to take.“We have to pick ourselves up but I know this team is capable of doing that.“We played some good football in the games before Ayr so we know what we are capable of.“The results haven’t gone our way, though, and it’s obvious Saturday just wasn’t good enough from us.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ive loved every second and now i want more dan","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDan Jefferies “loved every second” of his first-team chance last season and has vowed to grab any chance he gets this campaign with both hands.The 19-year-old featured in the two final home matches of last season, as a substitute in a 1-0 win over Hamilton before starting the home defeat to Partick Thistle that concluded the campaign.The Welshman, who started his career in Swansea’s youth academy, joined the Dark Blues in January after leaving Colchester United and impressed in the U/20s team that narrowly missed out on the Development League title.He also grabbed a goal in last week’s Irn-Bru Cup win over Hibs Colts for the Dundee youth side and says he thinks he’s ready for another shot at first-team football.Though, he admits jokingly, he might have to calm himself next time he’s out on the pitch in the senior game.Describing his time in the first team last season, he said: “I loved every second of it – once you step on that pitch everything is mad, it’s crazy and you don’t know what to do!“You need to calm yourself down a bit but I’m buzzing to have played for the first team and, hopefully, I can get more chances this season.“I think I’m ready to make the step up.“With the players in front of me in my position, I’m always learning from them, they are always helping me and everyone around the training ground is helping me.“If I do get a chance this year, I’ll give my all and I think I am ready for it – I’ll definitely take it with both hands and I won’t look back.”As a centre-back, Jefferies certainly has plenty of competition to get through ahead of him.As far as central defenders go, the Dark Blues boast an array of experience – Steven Caulker being an England international and former Liverpool and Spurs defender, Darren O’Dea won numerous trophies at Celtic, Josh Meekings is a Scottish Cup winner and Genseric Kusunga has two Swiss league titles to his name.For Jefferies, that doesn’t pose an insurmountable hurdle but rather gives him an ideal opportunity to learn from players who have been there and done it.He added: “In training if you make a mistake, they don’t really get on to you, they encourage more than anything.“They want everyone to improve every day and because I’m young, I’m 19, I look up to the likes of Steven Caulker, Darren O’Dea, Josh Meekings and Gense – I mean, they’ve got some amount of experience.“I hope they can share it with me and I can move on with them.”After making the move north, Jefferies has settled into life quickly in Dundee and says the possibility of first-team football at a club with the stature of the Dark Blues was a big draw for him.“It was a quick six months at Colchester before the opportunity came about up here,” he added.“It’s a good club, I love it here, the people are friendly and I think I can learn more up here and maybe break into the first team.“The manager definitely gives young players a chance if he thinks they deserve it.“He believes in the youngsters and I am very grateful for the chance I had last season.“Hopefully, I can get more this year.“We play the same way as the first team and it’s all the same at Dundee so it’s not too much of a step up from reserve football but it’s older men with experience and you just have to put yourself about.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"life long dundee fan liverpool midfielder charlie adam linked with move away from stoke bolton wanderers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee fan Charlie Adam looks set for

Whether or not either is fit to start on Saturday remains to be seen.A swollen knee means Murdoch hasn’t played since the Betfred Cup tie against Alloa a month ago.Whereas Booth’s absence stretches back a few days longer, to when he picked up a knock at Ross County in his only competitive appearance so far.Just the fact both are back working normally, however, is good news for their gaffer, though he remains frustrated by the continued absence of winger Billy King because of a thigh injury.“Callum Booth has trained with the team and also Stewart Murdoch has trained fully with the team, so they are now fit.“Billy King is still struggling with this stupid injury that he didn’t even get from training,” added Csaba.“He hasn’t done one training session so far this season.“Last season he was one of the most important players for the team but he is struggling with this injury and it continues to affect him.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/01/PA-16052731.jpg.jpg ","title":"no exceptions pub giant jd wetherspoon bans dogs from all of its premises","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJD Wetherspoon is to ban dogs from the premises of its 936 pubs.Dogs will not be allowed inside the operator’s pubs or in its beer gardens from September 10.The firm blames children\u0026#8217s fears and hygiene factors for the end of exceptions to an historic policy.Notes about the new rules have been put up in a few branches.The company’s policy on dogs reads: \u0026#8220Please note that Wetherspoon has a policy of not allowing dogs in its pubs, including all outside areas (assistance dogs excepted).\u0026#8220This policy was introduced shortly after the company was founded in 1979, although, in recent years, we have allowed a few exceptions.\u0026#8220After much consultation, we will now be strictly enforcing this policy everywhere.\u0026#8220In order to give those affected time to adjust, we have set a deadline of Monday, 10 September.\u0026#8221Punters spotted a notice in the Admiral Collingwood pub in Ilfracombe on the ban, according to Devon Live​.Previously, dogs at the north Devon pub are “only allowed at the picnic benches at the front of the pub and must be supervised at all time”.It said: “This is a company decision and has been made in the interest of consistency across all JD Wetherspoon pubs.”Assistance dogs, which support adults and children with a range of disabilities, will still be permitted on the premises of all the pubco\u0026#8217s sites.Spokesman Eddie Gershon said: \u0026#8220Even well-behaved dogs can be unpredictable and every dog owner thinks their dog is perfect.\u0026#8220We welcome a lot of children and families at our restaurants.

spring1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCobbles in an Aberdeen conservation area which were temporarily covered with tarmac are expected to be repaired next year.The Old Aberdeen community previously hit out at the eyesore repairs undertaken to a section of the cobbled High Street.The works, at College Bounds and High Street, were undertaken by Aberdeen City Council in May this year, to improve safety in the area where there were sections of missing stones.It emerged that to make the repairs, it would cost Aberdeen City Council more than £100,000, which the local authority said could not be accommodated within the current financial year’s budget.The Old Aberdeen Community Council, alongside councillors, wrote to the local authority urging officers to take urgent remedial action, with Councillor Alexander McLellan even writing to outside bodies in a bid to secure the funding that was needed to carry out the repairs.At a meeting of the Old Aberdeen Community Council on Tuesday evening, a roads officer revealed that a source of funding has now been identified, and that it is hoped work will be carried out in the spring.Transport spokesman at Aberdeen City Council and ward councillor for Old Aberdeen, Ross Grant, said: “When there is a defect in the cobbles the problem can become a domino effect if it’s not dealt with.“The council officers said that 70 metres of the road will be reconditioned – where the cobbles will be taken up and relayed in the full and proper way.”Repairs were carried out after a member of the public tripped on the cobblestones and reported it to the council.The problem was classified as a category two defect by safety inspectors and, as a result, the repairs had to be carried out within a week.Pouring tarmac on the road was deemed the fastest way to temporarily repair the area without damaging the cobblestones.To fully repair the road, it will take six to eight weeks, followed by a further four weeks to cure.Mr Grant added: “The work the council is carrying out is to repair the road as properly as they can.“As an administration, we are committed to seeing the works through and keeping the community involved.”Utilities companies need to be given three months’ statutory notice to plan work, which made an immediate permanent fix earlier this year unfeasible.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"demolition of old nursery is end of an

to be home to Middlefield Nursery, which has since moved to the Hub in Middlefield.The old building is due to be demolished as part of the £30 million Haudagain redevelopment scheme.Staff at the current nursery are hoping for a big turnout when the building is taken down on Monday, in what will be an “emotional” moment for workers.Marie Macdonald, who is the nursery manager at the Middlefield Community Project, which runs the nursery, said: “When we found out the time and date of the demolition, we thought that it was an end of an era.“With all the families in the area that have used the nursery, we thought that it might be nice to mark it together.”As well as people from the community, Marie hopes to take some current pupils to the site.She said: “We don’t have a huge number of pupils who were attending in the old building, but we do have a couple, so we were hoping to be able to take them down on Monday afternoon.”Marie added: “It’s for any other families, past and present – it’s quite poignant and it’s the end of an era for some people.“The Community Project has been running for a long time so we’ve had people messaging us with their kids now in their 20s.“We just want people to have that shared experience, because the whole community is changing, a lot of the community is being knocked down.“The project and the nursery has played such a big part in people’s lives and it’s the end of that, in a positive way.”Marie also expects her staff to be feeling nostalgic. She said: “There’s always going to be nostalgia for the place.“Our project co-ordinator has been here for a long time, we’ve got a member of staff who’s been here for 20 years, so it’s part of their life.

We were confident that this performance is sustainable.”Service users often go on weekends away and take part in activities such as canoeing.Such outings, said the report, “provided a stimulating programme of new and enjoyable experiences and opportunities to meet up with old friends”.Placements allow service users to make friends and become less isolated, the report added.They have also become fitter, started to eat better and have learned about alcohol awareness and work opportunities.The report said: “A culture of continuous improvement was evident and involved the whole team under the manager’s highly capable and supportive leadership.”The report added: “Family members felt the weekends away allowed opportunities to mix with others and for their relatives to improve self-confidence and to have social opportunities.“Another felt her son would do things on the weekend away that he wouldn’t normally do.”The service’s team leader Sue Mahony said: “We are delighted to receive such a positive report from the Care Inspectorate, which highlights a year of exciting partnership working by so many people.“Shared Lives Aberdeenshire has consistently received high grades over the last few years, as well as being shortlisted in the Scottish Social Services Awards for two consecutive years.“To achieve an ‘excellent’ grade from the Care Inspectorate is testament to the hard work of everyone who is part of the scheme – not just the council but, importantly, Shared Lives carers, people who use this service and their families.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scheme views wanted","story":"\t\t\t\t\tResidents in the north-east are being urged to have their say on a new scheme by Zero Waste Scotland.A team from the organisation will be in Aberdeen next Tuesday getting views on its deposit return initiative.Under the scheme customers will pay a small deposit when they buy drinks and have that returned once they hand the empty container back for recycling.People will be asked their views on which type of items should have a deposit on them and where they should be able to return them.Amy Weir from Zero Waste Scotland said: “We have been really encouraged by the response from members of the public at all the events so far and we are looking forward to visiting Aberdeen to hear from the local community.“Now that a public consultation on a Scottish deposit return scheme is live we want as many people as possible to have their say.”Craig Stevenson, centre manager at the Bon Accord Shopping Centre, said: “We are delighted to host Zero Waste Scotland at Bon Accord to speak to shoppers about a deposit return scheme for Scotland.”The team will be at the Bon Accord Centre from 11am until 3pm next Tuesday.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"spider found in north east confirmed to be a black widow1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA spider found in a crate from the US by a north-east firm has been confirmed as a black widow.The arachnids are known to be highly venomous, and after it was spotted by employees at a company in Portlethen, the Scottish SPCA was called to assist.It was placed in a container while the animal charity collected it, where it was taken to the Drumoak centre and was waiting for formal identification.After being positively identified, the spider had to be put down.Scottish SPCA chief superintendent Mike Flynn said: “We can confirm we were alerted to a black widow on Thursday after it was found in a crate from America.“Bites from the black widow can be dangerous to humans and can cause severe muscle pain and muscle spasms.“Sadly the spider had to be put to sleep as there is nowhere in Scotland to safely rehome it and we could not keep it in our centre due to severe health and safety concerns.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures aberdeen maritime museum through the decades","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThis week we’ve searched our archives for some of our favourite images showing how Aberdeen\u0026#8217s Maritime Museum has changed over the past few decades."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/07/18, 3:43 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.It was a case of \u0026#8216all\u0026#8217s well that ends well\u0026#8217 for young Adam in the Furnace hills last week.Police officers and his mum left him in no doubt of how narrow an escape he had.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"donalds drive to solway trophy inspired by gran","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/08/18, 11:43 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSome of Argyll\u0026#8217s rally crews travelled to the Solway Coast near Dumfries for the next round of the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship (STRC) on Saturday August 4.Again the crews were blessed with decent weather at the Dundrennan training camp for the eight stages.

There were, in fact, 1,571 sticks in the trailer \u0026#8211 worth more than £160.Another competition was to guess the number of daffodils in a jar.

The Mid Argyll drummers were tied on points with Lower Clyde Pipes and Drums across the season but the fact Lower Clyde got a better result on the day put them just ahead, leading to confusion.Craig Lang said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been a historic season for the band, being crowned British champions in May, then going on to win Champion of Champions on Saturday, an unbelievable achievement for such a young group.\u0026#8216Myself and lead drummer Graeme McMillan are immensely proud of every member.

The Labour list MSP hit out as it was announced rail users traveling to Glasgow from Kilmarnock will have to shell out an additional \u0026pound55 for season passes. Regulated rail fares are set to rise by 3.2 per cent, in line with the retail price index rate of inflation, from January. That will see a season pass increase from \u0026pound1692 to \u0026pound1746. Commuters in Ayr would see an increase of \u0026pound78 from \u0026pound2452 to \u0026pound2530 for a season pass. Mr Smyth said: “These rail fare rises are unwanted, unwelcome and unnecessary. “It is simply unfair that commuters in Ayrshire are being burdened with these rip-off rail fares for less than satisfactory services.  “The cost of rail fares being paid by passengers is simply unacceptable, with passengers from Kilmarnock having to fork out \u0026pound1746 a year to travel to and from work. “Scottish Labour is clear: it’s high time working people stopped having to pay such excessive fares to simply line the pockets of private companies. “Only Labour is fighting for a publicly owned railway which will serve the many, not just the few.” Elsewhere, an annual Lockerbie-Edinburgh fare will now cost \u0026pound5250 – up \u0026pound162 – after the Scotish Government decided peak fares were to increase. Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the rises were “unwelcome” and stressed action had been taken to minimise them.  Increases in off-peak fares in Scotland will be held at 2.2 per cent as the government have pledged to cap them at 1 per cent below inflation. All fares in England will rise by the RPI rate of inflation. Mr Matheson said: “This means in Scotland average fares increases are lower than England and Wales.” In recent months staff from rail union RMT have staged protests in cities around the UK. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, said it was “nothing short of a scandal” that ticket prices were up to five times more than fares in Europe. Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles MSP said the rises are the last thing hard-up passengers need.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyScottish LabourGlasgowAyrKilmarnockEconomyTransportLockerbieKilmarnock NewsTransport ScotlandCheap travel"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"musical tribute concert honour loved","story":"NewsMusical tribute concert will honour loved onesFollowing on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie16:27, 22 AUG 2018NewsColin Price and Pauline Moriarty join together for the tribute concert (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA musical tribute concert will honour the lives of two well loved members of the community. Following on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month. Joan Price, a beloved trombone player, was tragically killed in a road traffic accident in January 2017 by two boy racers who are now serving jail sentences. Joan’s fellow band members wanted to do something to honour her memory and decided to organise a concert featuring all three bands which she had played for. Kilmarnock Concert Brass, Irvine \u0026amp Dreghorn Brass Band and Dunaskin Doon Band will join together on September 1 to pay tribute to the Troon gran. The brass band show will now be an annual event, with each band taking it in turns to nominate a charity. This year Kilmarnock Concert Brass has chosen Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) as the worthy recipients. Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) supports bereaved families of suicide victims and any troubled person by providing and funding services such as counselling, music, play and drama therapy.  The charity was set up by mum, Pauline Moriarty, originally from Ayr, following the suicide of her 13-year-old daughter, Jenna. The concert will honour Joan and Jenna with traditional marches, big band hits, movie themes and film scores. Tasty treats and a raffle will be on offer during the interval. Colin, Joan’s husband said: “Our family is delighted and honoured that the three bands have decided to make this concert an annual event in Joan’s memory. A lot of hard work goes on behind the scenes to make a concert like this happen and I’m indebted to everyone who has helped or who is playing on the night. “Last year’s concert was a fantastic night of entertainment and I’m looking forward to meeting many old and new friends again this year.” Pauline Moriarty added: “We are so touched the bands have chosen to raise funds for the work of a Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO). It is such a lovely tribute to Joan Price and it will help us to potentially save lives.” Joan Price Memorial Concert will take place on Saturday, September 1 at 7pm at Kyle Academy on Overmills Road in Ayr. Tickets, \u0026pound7 (under 12s and over 65s \u0026pound5) are available by emailing secretary@ddband or messaging Dunaskin Doon Band on their Facebook page. A limited number of tickets will also be available on the night.

Fraser and Freya Russell have qualified for the National final of the American Golf Junior Golf Championships. The pair, who live in Troon and attend Marr College, progressed from the qualifying competition held at Leven Links Golf Club and now go forward to the final which will be televised on Sky Sports later this year. Competing in the gross score stroke play competition, 14-year-old Fraser, who incredibly plays off a five handicap at Royal Troon, put in a superb performance to take the qualifier with a score of nine over par. Not to be outdone by her older brother, Freya, 12, put in a fantastic performance to score 32 points in a stableford off a handicap of 13 in the girls’ net score competition. That was enough to take top spot and secure a spot in the final at Gainsborough Golf Club, where she will take on the UK and Ireland’s best girls. Speaking after the qualifier, Fraser said: “I am delighted with how I played, it will be a great chance for me to play golf on a good stage and I can test myself against some of the best.”  And younger sister Freya is looking forward to the continuing her golfing journey as she commented: “I love to play different golf courses, meeting new friends and getting to play golf with other girl golfers.” The pair play their junior medals on the Portland Course at Royal Troon, but due to their impressive handicaps they are allowed to enter in competitions that are played on the par 71 Old Course. They are both coached by Royal Troon pro Kieron Stevenson. Both Fraser and Freya represent Ayrshire for their age levels, and Freya has been playing with the West of Scotland U18 team since she was just nine. And they both played in the World Championships at the stunning Pinehurst course, which held both the men’s and women’s US Open just a year later - won respectively by Martin Kaymer and Michelle Wie.  Pinehurst has also been pencilled in for the 2019 US Amateur Championships and the 2024 US Open. The pair’s dad, Craig, has always played golf and he helped get them into the sport. Craig, who played golf for Cambridge University, said: “They have always been interested in golf. “I took Fraser to play at a young age, and Freya’s first steps were when she got up to pick up her brother’s golf club! “I’ve never forced it on them though, anytime they play golf it’s because they want to, which I think is the key. “They aren’t just into golf though, Fraser plays rugby for Marr and Freya wants to play hockey for her school, and both of them swim.” "},{"url":null,"title":"homebase-in-hawick-earmarked-for-closure","story":"A DIY store in Hawick has been earmarked for closure.\nIt is among 10 stores in Scotland which have been listed by Restructuring company Hilco to close over the next 16 months.\nThe company bought the struggling chain in May for \u0026pound1.\nWithin a Company Voluntary Arrangement Hilco aims to shut under-performing shops.\nThe company said it was unable to say how many staff were affected at its Scottish stores, but staff at closed stores will be redeployed within the business where possible.\nHomebase chief executive Damian McGloughlin said: \"Launching a CVA has been a difficult decision and one that we have not taken lightly.\n\"Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the under-performance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs.\n\"The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"window-of-opportunity-for-energise-galashiels","story":"A LOCAL window cleaner has volunteered his time to help with the \u0027pane-staking\u0027 clean-up in Galashiels.\nEnergise Galashiels is working to regenerate the town centre.\nAnd many of its members listed the growing grime around many empty stores in the town centre as a major eye-sore.\nLast week, with the help of local window cleaner Rob Gibson, they began a major shop frontage clean-up.\nMany landlords of the vacant units have now agreed to organise displays in the windows to further improve the look of the town.\nMike Gray, chair of Energise Galashiels Trust, told the Border : \u0026ldquoOne of our aims at Energise Galashiels Trust is to create a more vibrant, welcoming community.\n\"To achieve this we work with a variety of partners and volunteers on a range of projects.\n\"We were thrilled when Rob Gibson agreed to help our efforts by cleaning the windows of some of the town\u0026rsquos vacant retail premises - the difference is remarkable.\"\nMike admits several landlords weren\u0027t so forthcoming with offers of help.\nBut the Trust still carried out the clean-up irrespective of support from the owners.\nAnd members are now fundraising to continue cleaning the empty shops.\nHe added: \"Our volunteers have subsequently started a campaign to rise funds to enable us to carry out the work on a more regular basis.\n\"It was agreed that something as simple as cleaning a window made such a difference.\"\nThe Trust also hopes to tackle illegal fly-posting on the empty frontages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-young-would-be-politicians-to-make-a-difference","story":"YOUNG Borderers with a passion for politics are being urged to register their interest for next year\u0026rsquos Scottish Youth Parliament elections.\nThe elections are due to take place in March and those aged between 14 and 25 are eligible to stand.\nThe democratically-elected Scottish Youth Parliament (SYP) aims to give Scotland\u0026rsquos youngsters a voice.\nWith the decision makers of Scotland taking notice, it allows young people to campaign on the issues which they feel matter most.\nThere are three Scottish Borders MYSPs, elected by their peers.

service.\n\u0026ldquoThere are now fewer welfare officers and they are all working across different services.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom hoping this petition will give some understanding to councillors

McFadyen and Sons is moving into a new field next week.It is starting production of concrete products such as building blocks, paving slabs, kerbs, fence posts, and reconstituted stone.The firm has set up a subsidiary company, Kinloch Precast, to handle this business and their premises will be on the site of the former Campbeltown sawmill which has been bought from Campbeltown Town Council.One of the partners in the firm, Mr Malcolm McFadyen, told the Courier that to start with, two or three men would be employed and eventually they hoped to employ 10 or more.Orders were already coming in for concrete products and it is hoped that Argyll builders, individuals, and local authority undertakings would support this local enterprise and at the same time save themselves transport costs and time, awaiting deliveries from elsewhere.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOIn aid of the Comforts Fund of the Queen Mary Guild a grand fete and sport were held on Saturday last in the showfield.A most attractive list of events was announced, and this, combined with the fact that the carnival had been organised in the interests of the Kintyre men on naval and military service, brought out a crowd that was worthy of the occasion.Unfortunately the weather, which from early morning had not been too promising, and which was showery throughout the day, broke down completely ere the finish of the sports but notwithstanding the discomfiting conditions all the events were pulled off.A fancy dress cycle parade at 1.30 reminded the townspeople that something unusual was afoot.About fifty young ladies and gentlemen took part in the procession, which, starting from Stronvaar Avenue, traversed the usual route, with the sports ground as the terminus.The parade was very effective, the adornment of the bicycles and the \u0026#8216get-up\u0026#8217 of their riders being artistic, novel, and in several instances highly amusing.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage centre embraces iconic red roofs","story":"Members of Carradale Community Trust chose red when repainting the village\u0026#8217s Heritage Centre to ensure it stands out on Google maps.On Monday a group of volunteers, including Malcolm Trott, Alasdair Bennett, Tony Leighton, Stuart Hosie, Alan Walker and Alan Milstead  started work on a project to liven up the museum.During the scheme, funded by East Kintyre Wind-farm Trust, items covering the history and economy of Carradale through the years will be re-displayed.A Trust spokesperson said: \u0026#8216It is hoped to finish the work by next spring.\u0026#8216The colour scheme chosen was subject to considerable debate and it is anticipated that the new colour will be clearly seen on Google maps.\u0026#8217Volunteers, from left: Malcolm Trott, Alasdair Bennett and Stuart Hosie prepare the roof.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.

It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

That has led to questions being asked as to how the current doctors\u0026rsquo surgery, on Newton Port, will cope with the increase in people.  Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.  The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe new housing is phased, which enables us to plan ahead.  \u0026ldquoAt the moment we are still looking at a range of options.  \u0026ldquoOf course, the focus on greater multi-disciplinary working coming in now with the new GP contract will allow patients much greater flexibility and swifter access to the right clinical professional at surgeries and other local settings.  Provost John McMillan, a councillor for Haddington and Lammermuir ward, said planning the development of any future health facility had to be carefully weighed up.  Mr McMillan also noted the variety of services which would be included within the new \u0026pound70 million hospital.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is the same issues around working with a town that has got a good town square and you need to look at car parking.  \u0026ldquoWe are looking at that in a measured way and working in partnership.  \u0026ldquoIt is the same with families with young children coming in and an ageing population.  \u0026ldquoYou have to look at schools and the health service as well."},{"url":null,"title":"pear-tree-nursery-set-to-create-up-to-30-jobs-in-haddington","story":"  Pear Tree Nursery has opened a second facility in the town in a former bed and breakfast on West Road.

Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe wanted a second site because of the waiting list we had at Meadowpark and were delighted to be able to take on the former B\u0026ampB on West Road.  \u0026ldquoOur open day showed how much nursery places are in demand and with all the new houses being built we knew there was a need for it.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have a second nursery in Haddington.

According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.

If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a variety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening.

Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010.

She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform (although hair still looking slightly wild as she likes it), she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to (literally) beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder.

But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington. Mr Wallace said: \u0026ldquoIt made a huge difference \u0026ndash the kids loved seeing them and they were great."},{"url":null,"title":"new-headteacher-wants-to-make-knox-academy-a-flagship-school-for-east-lothian","story":"  Susan Cook took charge at the Haddington school this week after moving from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Trinity Academy, where she was acting headteacher.  Pupils returned on Wednesday, with Ms Cook planning a series of assemblies to introduce herself to the students.  She said: \u0026ldquoI would like to make Knox Academy a flagship school in East Lothian \u0026ndash Scotland, potentially.  \u0026ldquoI want all young people to leave to a positive destination but be healthy and happy as they move through the school and really enjoy their school experience.  \u0026ldquoI want pupils to enjoy education in the widest sense, not just the curriculum but wider activities, and to develop as rounded individuals when they leave school to meet the demands of an ever-changing society.  Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoI found when I was at Trinity Academy, the headteacher and the senior leadership team were in the middle of the school.

She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.  Currently the school is undergoing a large-scale expansion, which is due to be fully complete in early November.  Ahead of the new term starting, a section of the extension has been opened, which will give access to six new classrooms.  More than \u0026pound10 million is being spent on the extension, which includes a new two-storey L-shaped block to the east side of the school.  It will not only be home to new classrooms but also a home economics department, new library and learning centre with a dedicated IT space, and additional PE changing rooms.  Mrs Slowther, who has previously worked at both Knox Academy in Haddington and Ross High School, Tranent, felt it was a \u0026ldquophenomenally exciting time for the school.  The 36-year-old, who is joined by Ed Offer and Richard Maxton as depute headteachers, as well as Suzanne Hamilton as acting depute headteacher, said staff were taking the school into a new era.  The new headteacher, who was previously a biology teacher, added staff had talked about what they could do \u0026ldquoto preserve what is really special and how we continue delivering absolutely the best education for every young person that comes through our doors.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe call it Sunny Dunny.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"whats-on-this-weekend-five-ideas-of-things-to-do-in-east-lothian","story":"  1.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.

North Berwick Community Council (NBCC) contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy.

With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed.

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.

Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.

He said he\u0026rsquod be down soon and the next minute he was at the door!  The 22-year-old came sixth with partner Laura Crane on this year\u0026rsquos season of Love Island. Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well. My friends all said they should\u0026rsquove come round to see me!  Jack\u0026rsquos visit certainly lifted Hannah\u0026rsquos spirits as she now faces another agonising four to six months off the mat through injury.  \u0026ldquoI just fell awkwardly, she said.  \u0026ldquoI actually carried on which probably wasn\u0026rsquot a good idea, and then I got withdrawn from the European Championships.  \u0026ldquoIt was my first big selection which is why I was in denial about being injured.  Even with this bump in the road, Hannah is adamant to make it to the top.  \u0026ldquoI got into [judo] when I was five through my friends doing it, she said.  \u0026ldquoWhen I was about 12 I started doing competitions and this year I\u0026rsquove been travelling loads.  \u0026ldquoI went to Japan for a six-week training programme and trained full-time with the Japanese kids. It was hard but I loved it.  \u0026ldquoI want to go full-time when I leave school."},{"url":null,"title":"hearing-to-take-place-on-substation-plans-at-former-cockenzie-power-station","story":"  Scottish Ministers called in the planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) earlier this year before East Lothian Council had been given a chance to make a decision on the proposal.  ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"military-exercise-to-take-place-near-north-berwick","story":"  The exercise, run by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), takes place between September 3 and 21 at Gin Head, the former Second World War radar site at Tantallon, to the east of the town.

I\u0026rsquom not saying that journalists then could ever have been regarded as pillars of society fighting off invitations to join school boards and open local flower shows but they were accorded a degree of respect tinged with fear.  This was rooted in an acknowledgement that the newspaper game was a difficult one to enter (more so if the school you attended was named after a saint) and that you had access to privileged information and the secrets and lies of politicians and celebrities. In the West of Scotland you were assumed to have mastered the ability to retain and recall information even after a potentially life-changing quantum of alcohol had been consumed. We didn\u0026rsquot really know much about anything in particular but we knew a little about a lot and often that was just enough to persuade your lay friends and acquaintances that you were a polymath and a true lad o\u0026rsquo pairts.  There were good reasons why in England especially journalists were considered to be ideal fodder for Britain\u0026rsquos intelligence services: they seemed to move effortlessly among the salons of captains and kings without ever being considered members they thrived on conspiracies and were artful in the ways of extracting information from reluctant witnesses. It was well-known that the big English newspaper titles offered a means of decent employment for the \u0026lsquodifficult\u0026rsquo offspring of the aristocracy who were not considered to possess sufficient backbone for an officer career in the armed forces or the Conservative Party.  Rarely though, were newspaper journalists ever called to account for the opinions they offered and the stories they spun. The single letters page that existed in a newspaper was the exclusive preserve of retired teachers and military historians epistles critical of individual journalists were routinely spiked. In Scotland in 2018 the output of journalists, especially those who report on politics or football, are scrutinised and analysed to an extent unimaginable less than a generation ago.  Few of us can have any complaints. We are paid decently for the privilege of airing our grievances and indulging our preferences. Rarely do we stop to consider the effect our words can have on the targets of our prose and their families and when we do, we all too often reach for the \u0026ldquopublic interest justification a concept that possesses an astonishing measure of elasticity.  The last decade or so has borne witness to the most turbulent and dramatic period in modern Scotland\u0026rsquos political and constitutional history. The independence campaign will continue until another referendum and our relationship with Europe, which is also woven into the constitutional debate, will shape our economy and politics for another generation. Since 2005 there have been three Holyrood elections four UK elections, an independence referendum and a plebiscite on our membership of the European Union. It seems we are never far away from an election that will be \u0026ldquothe most important of modern times.  In another age newspapers would have increased pagination and staff numbers to cover these adequately in Scotland there has been a decrease in both. Into this huge deficit have come the tribunes of social media such as Wings Over Scotland, Bella Caledonia and an army of Twitter-users. In the mainstream media we harangue them and dismiss them for not playing to the long-accepted rules and conventions of form and language established by the newspaper elites over two centuries.  Jeremy Corbyn ventured into newspaper and media territory with his Alternative McTaggart lecture earlier this week. The leader of the opposition at Westminster made some salient points about our industry, although they might have carried more impact if he had agreed to answer some simple questions about his party\u0026rsquos failure in the last two years to construct a viable position on Brexit. Your primary obligation, Mr Corbyn is to oppose the main policies of the government of the day. For those of us who work in the Scottish media industry, though, his words carried little worth. As ever in these types of lectures this one was about another country and a different reality.  It occurred at a time when questions over the impartiality of the BBC on issues pertaining to Scottish independence have emerged once more. On the same day the corporation was forced into an embarrassing apology for its lop-sided interpretation of the latest GERS numbers. This came a few weeks after its bosses in London decided to have a tilt at the YouTube accounts of two prominent and influential independence bloggers. In addressing the BBC\u0026rsquos anointed and ridiculously protected and subsidised role in our national life Mr Corbyn failed to discuss the impact of its publicly-funded website on Scotland\u0026rsquos local newspaper sector. And when he talked about the narrow pattern of ownership among the UK\u0026rsquos biggest newspaper titles he stopped short of discussing the common thread that links them to the BBC: the hugely disproportionate numbers of privately-educated Oxbridge graduates who occupy their most influential positions.  When the second referendum on Scottish independence eventually happens, scrutiny of the conduct of our newspapers and broadcasters will eclipse that of the first one. Unionist supporters will seek to dismiss this as evidence of nastiness and division in Scottish society when they know it is nothing of the sort. Some of those on the Nationalist side of the debate will look for phantoms that don\u0026rsquot exist either, especially in the corridors of BBC Scotland. They need to exercise caution here. Aristocratic, Conservative and right-wing ownership of most of our national titles has existed for more than a century and in that time few financially viable proposals have emerged to dilute those interests.  By all means highlight whenever possible those instances when the bias of the owners is manifest. Loud campaigns to boycott the BBC or to intimidate and harass journalists on social media though, are not a good look to that crucial six per cent of the voting population who require to be persuaded that an independent Scotland is not a merciless place."},{"url":null,"title":"visa-refusal-denies-us-teacher-her-dream-scottish-job","story":"  Born in Harrisburg, the state capital of Pennsylvania, the 27-year-old has close family ties in Paisley, Renfrewshire, where her grandfather lived before emigrating in 1950.  With lots of second and third cousins in the city it seemed ideal when a teaching post was advertised in a Catholic primary school in nearby Glasgow.  After a successful interview, the usual background checks and an endorsement of her teaching credentials by the General Teaching Council for Scotland she had already started packing when the Home Office advised Glasgow City Council her visa had been rejected.  With her future in turmoil, Ms Farrell will now have to stay in America while the vacant post at St Angela\u0026rsquos Primary School, in Darnley, is re-advertised and she goes through the same visa process again.  \u0026ldquoIt was a dream come true for me to be allowed to enter Scotland to teach. My family is from Scotland so for me this almost feels like coming home, she said.  \u0026ldquoMy paternal grandparents are originally from Paisley and that was the the main reason for my desire to go abroad and teach. I thought I would be coming full-circle if I could return to their home country and teach in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThis is a goal that I have been working towards for over a year and I have invested a lot of time and money into this process. I also resigned from my teaching post in Virginia and moved my life back to my parents\u0026rsquo house before the move to Scotland.  \u0026ldquoDue to this setback it seems that I am in limbo, living back home with my parents without a job. It is still my goal to come to Scotland, and I am hopeful that it will happen because I know I can be an asset. I just need someone to give me that chance.  Despite widespread teacher vacancies across Scotland and a particular shortage of approved Catholics in the denominational sector, Ms Farrell was declined under the complex Home Office points based system.  Because the Westminster Government\u0026rsquos monthly immigration cap has already been reached it means all applicants are judged against each other on a set of criteria - including salary levels.  Those in occupations where there are shortages, such as the medical sector, are given priority with the rest of the places allocated according to factors such as level of salary or qualifications.  Teaching is currently not viewed as a shortage occupation and does not command the same sort of salaries as other professions.  Glasgow City Council has now re-advertised the post with the hope that the visa application will be successful at the second attempt.  Ms Farrell is also hopeful she will be soon be able to pursue her dream move.  She said: \u0026ldquoI was heartbroken when I received word that my sponsorship had been refused, but I am very fortunate that Glasgow has not given up on me and they still are going to reapply for the sponsorship.  A spokeswoman for Glasgow City Council said: \u0026ldquoFollowing a successful interview the teacher has been offered a job in Glasgow and we will do everything in our power to help her secure the correct documentation in order to teach.  A Home Office spokeswoman said the government recognised the contribution of international teachers, but the immigration system was designed to ensure employers \u0026ldquolooked first to the UK resident labour market before recruiting from overseas.  She added: \u0026ldquoWhen demand exceeds the monthly available allocation of places, priority is given to applicants filling a shortage or PhD-level occupation.  \u0026ldquoNo occupation on the shortage occupation list \u0026ndash which is based on advice by the independent Migration Advisory Committee \u0026ndash has been refused a place.  The Home Office is currently looking at creating more flexibility in the system by creating a specific category for doctors and nurses which will free up more places for other occupations.  Research by The Herald earlier this month revealed there were nearly 700 teacher vacancies at primaries and secondaries across Scotland.  Councils facing some of the most acute shortages include those in the North East such as Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and Moray, but there were also shortages in Glasgow.  Teaching unions argue the main problem is pay and conditions with the increasing workload of staff putting off recruits at a time when salaries have declined in real terms.  Glasgow also has an issue with the number of teachers with Catholic approval in its denominational sector.  It is not uncommon for there to be at least 40 teachers working in the sector who don\u0026rsquot have approval every year because of the wider shortages.  In 2016 Archbishop Philip Tartaglia, president of the Catholic Education Commission, said there would be \u0026lsquosignificant consequences\u0026rsquo for Catholic education should the \u0026lsquoacute\u0026rsquo problem not be addressed."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-under-pressure-to-suspend-alex-salmond-amid-allegations","story":"  Mr Salmond repeatedly denied criminal behaviour and insisted he has never sexually harassed anyone as he battled to save his reputation following explosive claims dating back to his time as First Minister.  It came as it emerged Ms Sturgeon refused to intervene in the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos internal investigation when Mr Salmond told her about the allegations earlier this year.  She said the claims were \u0026ldquoextremely difficult to come to terms with but could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.  An internal Government probe was launched in January after two staff members complained of sexual misconduct by Mr Salmond at Bute House in December 2013, when he was First Minister.  In an extraordinary day for Scottish politics, Mr Salmond revealed he met Ms Sturgeon three times after being told of the claims, during which he raised concerns about the \u0026ldquofundamentally flawed investigation into his behaviour.  Ms Sturgeon said she had \u0026ldquomade very clear she would not intervene.  The former First Minister is now taking the Scottish Government to court over its handling of the complaints process, and has demanded an inquiry into how details were leaked to a newspaper.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos shadow equalities secretary Monica Lennon said: \u0026ldquoGiven the serious nature of these allegations, it would be appropriate that the SNP suspends Alex Salmond\u0027s membership of the party with immediate effect.  In a statement released on Thursday night, Mr Salmond accused the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, of carrying out a \u0026ldquogrossly unfair investigation into the claims, branding some of them \u0026ldquopatently ridiculous.  But Ms Evans said his statement contained \u0026ldquosignificant inaccuracies. She also revealed Mr Salmond attempted to gag her from publicising the complaints by issuing legal proceedings.  Mr Salmond is now pursuing a judicial review of her probe, and insisted that if he wins \u0026ldquothere will be serious questions to answer at the top of government.  During a lengthy press conference, he refused to detail the nature of the allegations against him, whether he was anticipating more claims or whether complaints had previously been made about his behaviour as First Minister.  He also refused to say whether he had suggested to Ms Sturgeon that the Government\u0026rsquos investigation be dropped, instead answering: \u0026ldquoPrivate conversations as far as I\u0026rsquom concerned are private conversations.  \u0026ldquoWhat I would say is the very legitimate concerns, reservations, arguments about the nature of this, I have made to everybody at every possible opportunity.  Mr Salmond did not rule out suing Ms Evans or the Scottish Government for defamation after the current legal proceedings have finished.  He said he is \u0026ldquono saint and has made \u0026ldquomany mistakes in my life \u0026ndash political and personal, but denied sexual harassment or criminality.  The former politician said his family and friends \u0026ndash including his wife of almost four decades, Moira \u0026ndash had been \u0026ldquoincredibly supportive.  He insisted it was made \u0026ldquoexplicit to him when the Scottish Government launched its probe that it would be \u0026ldquototally confidential. But this was breached, he argued, when Ms Evans told him on Wednesday afternoon that she was making the claims public.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos only through a fair process that you can get a fair result. In the procedure of the Scottish Government, I had no access to evidence, witness statements. I was denied the right to speak to any serving civil servant.  Asked if he thought he would be suspended from the SNP, Mr Salmond said: \u0026ldquoI would advise everybody to suspend judgment until the court can make a judgment.  He said he did his \u0026ldquoabsolute best to cooperate with the civil service investigation, but had only seen a summary of the complaints against him and was not told the identity of the alleged victims.  But he insisted he was not seeking any sympathy. He said: \u0026ldquoIf I lose at the Court of Session then as I said, I\u0026rsquoll have to answer the complaints openly and publicly and I\u0026rsquoll do that as far as I\u0026rsquom able, with confidentiality and all that.  \u0026ldquoBut I don\u0026rsquot expect to lose. I expect to win. And that will have serious implications for the top administrators in the Scottish Government, but it might have beneficial consequences for a better process in the future.  Ms Sturgeon said Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos membership of the SNP would be \u0026ldquoconsidered in the fullness of time as more information became available.  A police spokesman said: \"We are carrying out an assessment of information which we have received and enquiries are at an early stage."},{"url":null,"title":"catalan-leader-carles-puigdemont-arrives-in-scotland-to-talk-about-independence","story":"  Mr Puigdemont was making his first trip outside Belgium since his international arrest warrant was lifted by the Spanish Authorities.

He went on: \u0026ldquoOne is they don\u0026rsquot want to study history, and secondly, having lived in this country for a very long time, probably all of their lives, they don\u0026rsquot understand English irony either.

Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme: \u0026ldquoI think this has all been taken out of context: whatever Jeremy has said throughout the years has always been about how to secure peace, particularly within the Middle East and also peace with justice for all concerned \u0026ndash both members of the Jewish community and also members of the Palestinian community.  \u0026ldquoIn that context Jeremy has devoted his life, so I think this would take expressions out of context in that way are not helping.

The employment tribunal which heard the case has now issued its ruling that BrewDog unlawfully discriminated against Mr Ross and treated him unfavourably because of his condition.The company, which has been valued at £1.8bn were told to pay compensation to Mr Ross in the sum of £12,052.New legislation which passed into law in 2015 prevented the tribunal from ordering that BrewDog staff undergo further equality training.A spokesman for the company said: “This was a really difficult situation for every member of our team involved in it, and clearly for the Tribunal panel too as their decision on the outcome was split.                                                                                                         “We worked with James in order to find a suitable alternative role within the business where his safety would not be compromised, but James wanted to keep his packaging role. “We ended up in a position where we had to balance James’ wishes with the best interests of the team around him, and while we regret that an agreement couldn’t be reached, we have a moral responsibility to prioritise the safety of our team. “We wish James all the best in his new role and his upcoming studies.”RNIB Scotland, which supports blind and partially sighted people, said: “Many employers still assume this group would be difficult or even impossible to employ.                                                                                                        “We know of journalists, teachers, bankers and physicists working in Scotland with sight loss.“It’s about encouraging employers to consider what people can do, not what they can’t.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"housing development for inverurie site","story":"        A new  housing development may be about to get underway in Inverurie following a recommendation to grant planning approval for a new development by CALA Homes.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Saturday 25 Aug 2018 3:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Saturday 25 Aug 2018 3:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Jobs boost for AMTE Power in Thurso","story":"THE number of staff at a Thurso business is to increase by 25 per cent over the next year following a partnership deal with a British technology company.The workforce at AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire. QinetiQ employs 6000 staff and has a turnover of around \u0026pound700 million.The deal comes as AMTE Power has invested \u0026pound1.5 million in a new automated production line at its Caithness operation.John Fox, the company\u0026rsquos marketing director, yesterday described the partnership agreement as \u0026ldquoa positive step for AMTE Power and the local economy.He explained the two business will work together to develop battery cells.\u0026ldquoWe will use our manufacturing expertise to utilise QinetiQ\u0026rsquos experience in battery technology and research to deliver new products, manufactured in Thurso to an international customer base, Mr Fox said.He said the companies will concentrate on four key areas: defence, the oil and gas industry, energy storage and electric vehicles. They plan to supply UK and European markets with niche batteries which customers would not be able to get elsewhere.Mr Fox said there is potential and opportunities in these areas and the increase in the Thurso workforce will be largely due to the link-up with QinetiQ.The partnership deal, he stressed, will allow customers to get products which \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquot rely on standard mass-produced cells from the existing supply chain.The agreement will enable the companies to develop \u0026ldquoa mutually beneficial relationship and lead to advances in batteries and energy storage products.\u0026ldquoOur staff in Thurso are fantastic and we will continue to grow our base there, he said. \u0026ldquoWe have 32 employees in Caithness at present but have plans for that figure to go up to 40 over the next year \u0026ndash that is a 25 per cent increase.\u0026ldquoThis is a great building block for the future development of the organisation.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald (vice-chairman), Catherine Patterson (secretary) and Garance Warburton (treasurer).Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Saturday 25 Aug 2018 3:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the capital grants previously available have made a real and positive impact.“Everyone agrees that encouraging new blood into farming is vitally important, including here in Orkney. At a time of real uncertainty for the sector, there is a need for the government to help provide what stability it can.“It is all the more surprising therefore that the minister has chosen to take this decision now.  I have written to Mr Ewing, who is due to visit Orkney next month, asking for a reassurance that the government does not intend to walk away from supporting new entrants and ensuring agriculture in Scotland has a bright future.”   \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Made with footage culled from up to 240 cameras that captured both the initial launch and the nine-day mission that followed, the film is a vital scientific document, a portrait of late \u0026#821760s America and a visually cogent exploration of man\u0026#8217s place in the universe.With an original score by Charles Morrow and a commanding narration by Laurence Luckinbill, the documentary won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival. However, for the next few decades, it was practically forgotten even the original printing elements were lost.Christopher Riley is a film producer, director and writer specialising in science, engineering and history. His work has been celebrated by BAFTA, the US Television Academy, the Royal Television Society, the Sundance Institute and the Grierson Trust.He is a regular contributor to  newspaper and presents science documentaries for BBC Radio 4. In 2007 he tracked down Theo Kamecke — who was working as a sculptor in upstate New York — and found that he held the only remaining 35mm print. Working closely with Theo, Moonwalk One was re-mastered, combining a unique 35mm director’s cut with newly transferred 16mm NASA flight film media, to create a new HD digital master of the film.This will be the first chance to see the new high-definition Blu-ray version of the film which is due to be released next year.Moonwalk One: The Director\u0026#8217s Cut is on at West Side Cinema, Stromness Town Hall, Saturday, September 8 at 7.45pm. The film has been programmed to coincide with #skyranMOON and the Museum Of The Moon at Stromness Academy.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Although the provision of public toilets is a non-statutory function of local authorities, the Scottish Government ensured that the criteria for the fund did include capital support for toilet provision, where there was a demonstrable need.\"She added that she was aware of the council\u0026rsquos toilet closure plans and said she had \"personally pressed\" the local authority to reconsider.Council leader Margaret Davidson said the cuts were part of wider measures to \"balance the budget and safeguard essential services\" amid a climate of reduced funding for councils across Scotland and the wider UK.What do YOU think?

Her cooking was what initially drew clients to come to the centre and her baking, he said, was \"legendary\".This theme was echoed by speeches from Ina Mackenzie, Mina Stewart and Kerry Watson. Laela Maclean composed a poem which reminisced and poked good-natured fun at Cis\u0026rsquos life in Lochcarron and the Centre.Cis\u0026rsquos husband Sandy kept the feet tapping with musical interludes on his accordion \u0026mdash including one tune called Christine Ross of Lochcarron, initially written for Cis by the late Iain Crichton, from Stornoway.Christine Houser, Donar MacIver and his son, Stephen MacIver sang Gaelic songs \u0026mdash the eyes of some of the older guests lighting up as they joined in the choruses.Cis was aided by Morag MacCuish to cut her retirement cake which had been made by Harry Gow, her favourite baker. She made a speech thanking everyone for their presence and for the gifts she had received from the clients, staff and board members.The event provided a lovely send-off for Cis. The afternoon ended with everyone joining hands to sing Auld Lang Syne accompanied musically, as in life, by her husband Sandy.Saturday 25 Aug 2018 3:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Hopes for a visitor trail around an area that was heavily militarised during WWII are now full steam ahead after the project team behind the Aultbea museum secured almost \u0026pound73,000 from the Scottish Land Fund towards the purchase of a former butcher\u0026rsquos shop it has been renting to house the display.People from 19 countries outside the UK were amongst the 5500-plus visitors dropping in between May and October last year and that number is set to mushroom as the facility is improved and plans for a wider trail developed.The project\u0026rsquos chairman Francis Russell told the Journal: \"To some extent we have become masters of our own destiny. This opens up new avenues of funding. The location on the NC500 is very important.\"We ask people when they come in how they heard about us and some say it was while they were driving by. It puts us on the map. We\u0026rsquoll look at the feasibility and cost of a major refurbishment and possibly an extension. We could do with much more space.\"Fellow project volunteer Elizabeth Miles said the boost \"will allow us to get on to develop it the way we would like\".She said: \"Owning the site will open new possibilities. We will look to create a WWII trail where everywhere gets visited. We\u0026rsquore hoping to really do something with it.\"Research found the NC500, which passes the makeshift museum, brought 29,000 extra visitors in its first year, adding an extra \u0026pound9m to the Highland economy.The \u0026pound72,820 award will contribute towards the purchase of the former butcher\u0026rsquos shop and surrounding land.Honorary president of the RACP George Milne said the aim is to create a multi-site museum for current and future generations to learn about the convoys.He said: \"The overall aim is to establish a unique multi-site museum in Wester Ross. Around Loch Ewe we hope to create a permanent exhibition centre, a WWII Trail with interpretation panels, a memorial garden, and the preservation of selected wartime buildings to honour all who served in the Arctic convoys to and from Russia from 1941-1945.\"\u0026nbspThe 75th anniversary of the last convoy to sail from the area will be marked in 2020, with relatives of servicemen and visitors from around the world expected to come in their droves.Gairloch Heritage Museum, which itself secured backing from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for a \u0026pound2m project to convert the old anti-aircraft operations room in the centre of the village into a state of the art new facility, welcomed the news.It said: \"Congratulations to our friends at Russian Arctic Convoy Museum on procuring the funds to purchase their exhibition centre. Their volunteers have worked really hard to achieve this. We are delighted to see this investment in their project, which recognises a very important aspect of the heritage of our area.\"Saturday 25 Aug 2018 3:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

He went on to buy a small 21ft fishing boat, teaching himself from YouTube and Google. He decided to start selling his own catch and found the demand was so high he started selling from other boats. With the high demand from restaurants for a wider variety of products, Coast \u0026amp Glen was born.He said: \"I have always thought it\u0026rsquos very important to support the local community with jobs.

Smart Metering Systems (SMS), which connects, owns, operates and maintains energy metering assets and databases, has inked the tie-up with renewable energy supplier Good Energy.            Good Energy, based in Wiltshire, has more than 250,000 customers across the UK, adding to the 2 million-plus customers already served by SMS.             Under the terms of the agreement, SMS will supply domestic smart meters as part of the UK government’s rollout programme, which requires that domestic energy supply companies provide their customers with a smart meter to use in their homes and small businesses by 2020.SMS will provide new “SMETS 2” smart meters to monitor energy usage, which have a user-friendly advantage over the previous SMETS 1 model, as they allow customers to switch suppliers without changing meters. The majority of smart meters soon to be installed under the main phase of the government’s rollout scheme will be SMETS 2.  Alan Foy, chief executive officer at SMS, which is quoted on the alternative investment market (AIM), said: “We are delighted to be working with Good Energy as their exclusive supplier, one of the UK’s leading suppliers of energy from renewable sources, in the rollout of their smart meter programme. “Good Energy have over 250,000 customers across the UK, SMS is well positioned to support them with the smart meter rollout given our strong track record for customer services and asset ownership and management.”            John Maltby, Good Energy chairman, said the partnership would lead to a good user experience for the supplier’s customers. He said: “We are pleased to announce our partnership with SMS as the chosen supplier of our new SMETS 2 meters, as part of the UK government programme to roll out smart meters to UK energy customers.“Good Energy is focused on making sure smart meters work for the renewable energy sector. “Partnering with SMS gives us the ability to provide our customers with a market-leading smart meter, and associated products, which will enhance user experience.”            This is the latest deal for SMS, which signed a meter rental agreement in February with Utilita Energy to provide more than 100,000 meters throughout the year.The firm in March upped its dividend by more than a quarter despite a dip in pre-tax profits.

Going behind the scenes is one of the great privileges of being a journalist.             I’ve been lucky enough to be shown round many extraordinary places that are off limits to the public, from airport runways to the top of the Forth Bridge.            However, once a year, hundreds of normally closed buildings across Scotland are opened for people to have a peek inside.Launched nearly 30 years ago as part of Glasgow’s year as European City of Culture in 1990, Doors Open Days (DOD) now describes itself as Scotland’s biggest free festival, generating 200,000 annual visits.DOD now provides not just access to 800 historic and architecturally notable buildings but a wide-ranging programme of guided tours and lectures, also all free.Over the years, I’ve looked inside many buildings in Edinburgh and Glasgow during DOD, joined fascinating tours of the Clyde and its bridges by bike and on foot.I’ve also been to lectures about Glasgow’s pioneering underground railways, visited former shipyards and the city’s oldest railway station building – the 170-year-old Pollokshaws West.            Of course, there are myriad other sites on offer by DOD over several weekends next month, a different one for each part of the country.READ MORE: Alastair Dalton: Experts reveal Scotland’s transport heaven – and hellThey include everything from private swimming baths and sheriff courts to breweries and an animal hospital.However, for those interested in how we get about, there are some 20 buildings and events connected with transport in Glasgow alone, and at least seven in Edinburgh, with the capital’s DOD events programme to follow.            Elsewhere, you can visit a newly installed train turntable at a railway heritage centre in Aberdeen, HMS Unicorn – Scotland’s oldest ship – in Dundee, and the construction site of a £35 million road in Perth, the new A9/A85 link.Edinburghers will have their first chance to enter the Edinburgh Trams nerve centre, at its depot in Gogar.Also on show will be Lothian Buses’ headquarters off Leith Walk, which are nearly a century old, and the Northern Lighthouse Board’s offices in George Street, which are approaching their 200th anniversary.There’s also a shed in Leith where the last shipbuilding at the historic port ended in 1984 after 500 years, and a bunker in Barnton from where RAF fighter attacks were co-ordinated during the Second World War.In Glasgow, I’m looking forward to hearing about the city’s roads from prehistoric times to the M8, and prospects for walking improvements, while you could also be shown round the radical Avenues project to widen pavement and cycle lanes on several major city centre streets and also create a new “Underline” route beneath the motorway.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

In July last year, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox was still insisting a trade deal between the UK and EU would be “one of the easiest in human history”, a common theme of the Leave referendum campaign. Fox recently revised his thinking, estimating there was a 60-40 chance of a no-deal Brexit after complaining bitterly that the European Union was putting “political ideology” before the lives of ordinary people.            However, as the UK Government yesterday laid out some of its contingency plans and advice for businesses about a no-deal scenario, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab adopted a radically different tone. There was no Brussels bashing instead he spoke of “our EU friends” and stressed that, even if the negotiations failed, “we would continue to behave as a responsible European neighbour, partner and ally”.            So Raab clearly has an idea of the sort of tone it is wise to adopt when attempting to reach an agreement with someone, particularly from a position of weakness.READ MORE: What would a ‘no deal’ Brexit look like?He said he was “still confident that getting a good deal is, by far, the most likely outcome” and that this was “our top priority ... our overriding priority”, but the UK Government did have to plan for the “unlikely” event of a failure of the talks. The 24 documents published yesterday gave advice for a number of different economic sectors, including trade, farming, medicine and finance. Some of them were more useful than others.Firms in Northern Ireland were told, for example, that “if you trade across the land border, you should consider whether you will need advice from the Irish government about preparations you need to make”. Civil servants in Dublin may find themselves busy today, attempting to answer hypothetical questions. The advice published yesterday is likely to be the first of a whole slew of similar documents, all of which essentially tell the same story. And that is one which makes clear just how deeply embedded the UK has become within the EU and how difficult extracting ourselves is going to be.If we wrench ourselves out in one sudden movement, we are extremely likely to come to serious economic harm with a serious risk of an “unmitigated disaster”, to quote Nicola Sturgeon. If we are able to negotiate a careful, managed withdrawal, the damage will be less, but still the economy will suffer and the lives of Fox’s “ordinary people” will be worse.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK.

This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nSaturday 25 Aug 2018 3:40 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary (better known as ‘Nana’) Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north. This could have a chilling impact on rights and representation in the six counties,\" he concluded.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8610896.1535013057!/image/image.jpg","title":"10 new jobs set to be created with the opening of intersport in antrim","story":"\nGlobal sports retailer, Intersport is set to open a new store at The Junction in Antrim, creating up to 10 new jobs. \n\n                \nIntersport has announced a significant £250,000 investment at the retail and leisure park, which will see the global brand open its doors in September, occupying a 5,600 sq ft unit next to Tom Tailor and O’Briens.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe new store is part of an ongoing £30 million redevelopment plan at the Antrim-based shopping centre and follows recent developments including the construction of a new McDonald’s restaurant and the arrival of the Beauty Outlet, the UK’s fastest growing beauty retailer. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIntersport is one of the world’s largest sports retailers and innovators in Sportswear, with over 5,500 stores, 220 of which are located in the UK. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe brand prides itself on providing active wear for all ages and abilities, from beginners to athletes, and will house an array of popular sporting brands including Adidas, Under Armour, Puma, Canterbury, ProTouch and Speedo.\n\n Alastair Coulson, Managing Director for Lotus Property said: “The arrival of Intersport is a welcome addition to the centre and further complements our growing portfolio of retail and leisure brands.\n\n“Building on other recent developments, including the arrival of The Beauty Outlet and the commencement of building work for McDonald’s, this marks another important milestone in our £30m Master Plan for The Junction.” \n\nPadraic McKeever, Managing Director of Sports Merchandising Ireland, which holds the Intersport franchise, added: “This latest store opening at The Junction is an exciting moment for Intersport. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The Intersport mission is to inspire and connect with the everyday athlete through sport and we can’t wait to work with the team at The Junction to spread this message to the people of Antrim and beyond.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try { _402_Show() } catch(e) {}    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8609219.1534923451!/image/image.jpg","title":"a level successes for dunclug college pupils","story":"\nDunclug College is pleased to be celebrating a seven per cent improvement in its A Level results for the 2017/18 year, school principal Ruth Wilson said.\n\n                \nDunclug College is pleased to be celebrating a seven per cent improvement in its A Level results for the 2017/18 year, school principal Ruth Wilson said.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nAmy Wilson, Kirstyn Lecky.

Teachers and support staff have worked hard to ensure that the school ethos has ‘created opportunities for success’. \n  \nWe would also like to acknowledge the success of our students in accessing collaborative courses through Ballymena Learning Together – especially with the NRC and Dunclug College, where our students were supported to achieve high grades in Mathematics, Construction and Environmental Technology.” \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_935983.jpg--.jpg?1534836410000\n","title":"round britain reception honour for cadet megan","story":"  \nA local teenager who is taking part in a round Britain remembrance challenge has been given a Mayoral ‘thumbs up’! \n  \nMid and East Antrim Borough welcomed very special guests to the borough this week as the Lord Nelson tall ship, crewed by cadets and disabled veterans, sailed into Northern Ireland.\n  \nAs part of the remembrance activities to mark the end of the First World War, 48 injured soldiers and 80 cadets are embarking on a voyage of remembrance, adventure and personal development as part of Lord Dannatt’s Round Britain Challenge.\n  \nOne of those taking part in the challenge is local teen Megan McGaughey, a member of the Army Cadets.\n  \nMegan was recently joined by family and friends at a special Mayor’s reception in The Braid to mark her achievements.\n  \nThe 17-year-old from Cloughmills, said she was honoured to be selected and vowed to rise to every challenge that comes her way.\n  \nMegan has been an established member of the cadets since 2012.\n  \nShe said that during her time with the cadets she had made friends for life, represented Northern Ireland on numerous occasions through playing different sports, and has learnt lifelong skills.\n  \nAnd having dropping anchor in Belfast, councillors and staff were buoyed by the opportunity to greet the crew of the Lord Nelson in Mid and East Antrim.\n  \nMegan has completed her junior and senior instructor course, enabling her to deliver fun-filled lessons full of knowledge.\n  \nProud mum Debbie said: “Megan’s rank of Sergeant shows the time and commitment she has put into cadets and the fantastic opportunities she has been given, such as the Lord Dannatt Round Britain Challenge. She enjoys every minute she spends in cadets.\n  \nThe Mayor, Cllr. Lindsay Millar held a special reception in Carrickfergus Town Hall on Monday evening, where guest of honour, Mrs Joan Christie, CVO, OBE, Her Majesty’s Lord-Lieutenant for the County of Antrim, was entertained by cadets from Essex, Yorkshire and Shetland recalling their adventures on the Edinburgh to Belfast leg.\n  \nThe complement is working together to sail around the UK on board a specially adapted tall ship, changing crew every 10 days in each capital city (London, Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff). In each changeover port there will be a celebration of remembrance, inclusivity and diversity.\n  \nEach 10-day voyage sees injured service personnel, cadets and instructors aged 16-25 working as a team to sail the ship to the next capital city, climbing the mast, helm the ship, setting the sails and much more.\n  \n Councillor Millar, said: “We were delighted to welcome the Lord Dannatt Challenge crew to Mid and East Antrim.\n  \n“We in Mid and East Antrim cherish our close links to the cadets, who are very dear to Mrs Joan Christie CVO, OBE, Her Majesty’s Lord-Lieutenant for the County of Antrim. “\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":null,"title":"65300  ","story":"                \nBALLYMONEY Foodbank has seen an almost 20% increase in usage since the introduction of Universal Credit in November 2017.\nThis is the disturbing news revealed by a Director of the local Foodbank after they recently compiled figures covering this past year. \nCo-Director of Ballymoney Foodbank Mr Peter Rawlins said: We looked at the number of vouchers dealt with, the number of people helped and the weight of food distributed in the six months leading up to November 2017 and in the five months after November 2017 (excluding December which is always a peak month for any foodbank) and we found there was an 18% increase in first five months of this year. \nMr Rawlins continued: This is a significant increase on the previous six months and on the corresponding months the previous year. Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

And it’s an ideal venue to host birthday parties and school or group outings.”\n\nAir-tastic currently has two trampoline parks, located in Bangor and Cork, with a number of other Air-tastic trampoline parks planned to open in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in due course. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor further information on Air-tastic and the Craigavon trampoline park opening visit www.air-tastic or search Air-tastic Craigavon on Facebook.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602227.1534344744!/image/image.jpg","title":"can you help a history project","story":"\nDid you ever work in the old Mayfair manufacturing company in Portadown? If so, then Mayfair Business Centre would like to hear from you.  \n\n                \nThe present day Mayfair Business Centre is inviting former workers who were employed at the sewing factory to discuss their memories and experiences of working there. This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority (EA) has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the

for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to remove lollipop men and women would be “unacceptable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While undoubtedly the Education Authority and the department have to explore every option to live within budget, this idea cannot be regarded as a serious suggestion and it is clear that the members of the Education Authority would reject any attempt to propose it,” said Peter Weir MLA.\n\n“The safety of our children must be paramount, and there is no need to remove the current process for assessing individual placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602298.1534346604!/image/image.jpg","title":"fifty years on from first civil rights march","story":"\nOn August 24, 1968, Northern Ireland\u0026#8217s first civil rights march took place between Coalisland and Dungannon. \n\n                \nOn the march were teachers, students and politicians who all wanted the same thing, equality and civil rights.

This is the first time the event has been staged in Ireland.\nPope Francis will arrive in Dublin on Saturday, almost 40 years since Pope John Paul II came and addressed the faithful at capacity Masses in Drogheda, Knock and Phoenix Park. Pope Francis’ first engagement will be meeting President Michael D Higgins before visiting St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral and then the Capuchin Day Centre, which provides hot meals, clothing and showers for the city’s homeless. Pope Francis will then preside at the Festival of Families in Croke Park.\nHis visit will conclude on Sunday with a closing Mass at Phoenix Park. An estimated 500,000 people are expected to attend with thousands more watching the live footage from around the world.\nRector of Clonard Monastery Fr Noel Kehoe said that the parish is running a bus to the weekend events in Dublin “on Friday” and that he will be staying “to attend both the festival of Families and attend the Papal Mass”.\nParish Manager at St Oliver Plunkett Parish Glen Phillips told the Andersonstown News that Pope Francis’ visit had created “such a buzz within the parish”.\n“We have a coach leaving tomorrow (Thursday) so that parishioners can attend the WMOF Congress in the RDS.\n“A number of families from the parish will also be attending the Festival of Families in Croke Park on Saturday and we are also running a coach to the Papal Mass in Phoenix Park on Sunday.\n “There is such a buzz around the parish as the Papal visit approaches. Many older parishioners remember Pope John Paul II’s visit and many young parishioners were brought up on stories about it. Pope Francis is re-invigorating the Church and many parishioners want to be part of that and show support for him,” he said.\nSt John’s Church was proudly displaying its bunting and Papal flags as parishioners filed out from Mass on Wednesday morning. Parish Manager Conor Neeson explained how some of the decorations had stood the test of time and dated back to John Paul II’s visit.\n“We will have a number of buses on from Friday morning taking parishioners down to Dublin for the Pope’s visit. As part of the Falls Road Pastoral Community, parishioners from Corpus Christi, St John’s, St Mary’s, St Paul’s and St Peter’s Cathedral will all be travelling this weekend. There is a great sense of occasion and I’ll be staying behind to organise the parish hall for the Mass on Sunday as we will be screening it live,” he said.\nChair of the Pastoral Council Annette Hinchcliffe said she will be attending the Mass along with her teenage children and had also been part of history when she travelled down on the train to see John Paul II say Mass in 1979.\n“Many of our elderly population in the parish would have loved to have attended the Mass on Sunday but a lot of the instructions about once people get off their buses is the walk to Phoenix Park which is a possible three miles. We thought it would be nice to bring everyone together to give them a flavour of the day so that they wouldn’t just be watching it in the house. Our parishioners will have an opportunity to come to the parish centre to watch the Mass and be with the other people in their parish,” she said.\nParishioner Frances McEvoy told us: “I’m going down today (Wednesday) for the different discussions and events that are taking place over the next couple of days each day ending with a Mass and I’m looking forward to enjoying the weekend celebrations as well.\n“I was in Phoenix Park whenever John Paul II came and I think this Pope has the same charisma. I think he will be very welcomed despite all that is going on at the minute.\n“It’s very exciting. I was in Rome before Christmas staying with friends and I was at one of his meetings, when he meets the people on a Wednesday. The atmosphere when he walks in is just incredible. There is definitely  something about him. I think despite in terms of some of the negative publicly there has been around the visit he will speak to the people and he speaks from his heart,” she said.\nAt an extremely busy The Holy Shop in city centre’s Chapel Lane sales assistants Maura McShane and Teresa Nolan told us how there had been “great interest” in their Pope Francis memorabilia ahead of the highly anticipated visit.\n“We have rosary beads, candles, framed photos of Pope Francis and prayer cards all to mark his visit for the World Meeting of Families,” explained Teresa. “He is a very popular Pope and the amount of our customers going this weekend to see him is unreal,” she said.\nMaura said that many people were calling in since staff created their window display and there was a real “excitement” with people ahead of the weekend.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"all the traffic and travel details ahead of the popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They had everything they wanted.\" \n\nMr Currie was brought up in Coalisland, an overwhelmingly nationalist town. \n\nHe was elected as a Nationalist MP for East Tyrone from 1964 until 1972, and was one of the founders of the SDLP.\n\nHe moved to the Republic in 1989 and was Fine Gael TD for Dublin West.\n\nIn June 1968 Mr Currie and others occupied a house in Caledon, Co Tyrone, in protest at the discriminatory allocation of houses by the local council. \n\nWhen he saw a 19-year-old girl \"who happened to be a Protestant and a unionist\" and \"worked at a unionist politician\u0027s solicitor\u0027s office\" being allocated a home ahead of 269 others on the waiting list, he said he felt compelled to take action. \n\n\"I just felt it was unfair, unjust, intolerable and something had to be done, and I did it,\" he said. \n\nMr Currie said he made the decision to organise the march after taking part in the protests against the housing situation, hoping the event would be similar to those witnessed in the southern states of the United States. Two months after that march, another civil rights protest ended in violent scenes when police clashed with protesters in Londonderry. \n\nMr Currie said organisers had actually been disappointed with the numbers that turned out for the march, which had been banned, yet he said it has since become one of the catalysts for the entire civil rights movement here. \n\n\"The RUC acted absolutely stupidly and in front of the television cameras, particularly RTE, they ran awry, they ran mad and it was on the television and was seen around the world and that really effectively gave the boost which became the very successful civil rights movement,\" he said. \n\nThe former TD said he regretted the loss of lives during the Troubles that ensued afterwards. \n\n\"It wasn\u0027t inevitable that it would happen,\" he said, insisting non-violence was at the heart of the civil rights movement. It was very unfortunate and was not inevitable. But I wish it hadn\u0027t happened.\"\n\nMr Currie added: \"The civil rights campaign was an extremely successful organisation and it actually changed the whole political scene as far as Northern Ireland was concerned, and of course I don\u0027t regret that.\" \n\nHe criticised the current power-sharing impasse at Stormont. He said it was a \"totally hypocritical situation\" that elected representatives were being paid when the Assembly was not sitting. \n\nVeteran DUP man Nelson McCausland has a very different interpretation of the civil rights movement. \n\nThe former Stormont minister said: \"It may be the anniversary of the first civil rights march but he said it was certainly not their first appearance on the streets in that they had been out in Easter in 1968 against the banning of the republican Easter Rising parade. \n\n\"That in a sense was part of the problem, that right from the start the civil rights movement was so closely aligned with Irish nationalism and republicanism.\" \n\nHe said the movement was \"never going to be a place that was welcoming to unionists\".\n\nHe added: \"The tragedy is that it led on eventually to a situation which broke out into violence that led to more than 3,000 people dead.\" \n\nThe former MLA claimed that there are a lot of inaccuracies when it came to the housing statistics from the time.\n\n\"Much of what was put forward as fact to justify claims of discrimination was actually manipulated,\" he claimed. \n\nHe said there were some examples where there was an \"unbalance\" but he maintained that overall there was a \"fairly reasonable\" spread of council housing going to Catholic and Protestants at the time. \n\n\"It\u0027s not the picture that was portrayed at the time,\" he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"girls 9 and 11 raise alarm after being targeted by","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We need to be aware and alert to that, and take whatever steps we can to minimise that risk.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added that parents should be aware of the sites and apps their children are using, and make sure sufficient blocks are set up on their devices. \n\nParents were also urged to tell their children not to show private photographs to anyone. \n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37245612.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/fatberg1.jpg","title":"massive fatberg pours out of sewer into west belfast street","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We would remind all our customers that opening a manhole and putting anything down it is forbidden. By doing this, you are obstructing a working sewer which is designed to take waste away from homes. Incidents like this cause out of sewer flooding and require valuable time and resources to resolve,\" she said.\n\nShe urged people to dispose of their fat, oil and grease properly. \n\n“While most homes and businesses use grease traps and bin their waste correctly, those that don’t, contributed to a massive fatberg in the sewers around the area,\" Mrs McCullagh said\n\n“We would appeal to all our customers, especially food outlets, to dispose of their fat, oil and grease appropriately. For householders, let it cool and then put it into the bin. Alternatively, pour it into a disposable container and take it to your local oil bank.\n\n“Businesses also risk blocking their own drainage systems, which results in extra costs being incurred in clean-up efforts. These fat blockages can not only result in out of sewer flooding, but odour problems and the risk of rat infestations both near and beyond your premises. Ways to dispose of FOG include fitting a grease trap, using an enzyme dosing system or recycling it.\"\n\nMrs McCullagh said the fatberg was having a negative affect on the whole community.\n\n“We have all seen the disgusting effects of an overflowing manhole in the street and no one wants to see or smell it (not even us!) but the reality is, it happens regularly at a cost of millions to NI Water each year,\" he said.\n\n“We all have the power to stop it. In the last ten years, NI Water has spent over £1.5 billion investing in water and wastewater infrastructure but no amount of investment will completely stop blocked pipes if people continue to flush wipes (including flushable), sanitary items and cotton buds down the toilet.”\n\nShe urged people to properly dispose of sanitary products.\n\n“According to recent research carried out by Water UK, 93% of the material causing sewer blockages was made up of wipes - including a high proportion of baby wipes - which are not designed to be flushed. Less than 1% of the domestic waste in the blockages was identified as made up of products which are designed to be flushed, such as toilet paper.\n\n“Customer awareness and behaviour change is the only real way to address sewer misuse it’s simple really, don’t flush anything other than paper, poo and pee.\n\n“Visit \nwww.niwater\n for further information.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland gcse results appendicitis didnt stop kira achieve amazing 11","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"noone wants to buy pope memorabilia say dublin market stall holders","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

as we were expecting thousands of visitors, but no-one is buying anything.\n\n“I was here for the last pope’s visit in 1979, we were selling six or seven flags at a time, now I’m barely selling one or two.\n\n“Ireland isn’t the same place it was back then, people are not as interested in the Pope and the church anymore, and who can blame them?\n\n“In Dublin especially, people are fed up with the hypocrisy and the cover-up of abuse.\n\n“I see the homeless people here every day, the church does nothing for them, day in and day out, and now they want them moved off the street for the Pope’s arrival, it’s hypocritical.”\n\n\n\nI\u0027d love to know where all these extra visitors are because they\u0027re not around here\nMarket stall

attention, she is not pulling in profits.\n\n“I’ve had photographers and journalists down here from Zimbabwe, Italy, South Africa, India, America – all over the place, everyone wants to take pictures of it, but no-one’s interested in buying it.\n\n“I tried myself to get tickets for the Mass in Croke Park and I couldn’t get any, I’ve lived in Dublin all my life, and sell Pope merchandise on the street and I can’t even get tickets.\n\n“I’d love to know where all these extra visitors are because they’re not around here.”\n\nBoth market stall holders say they are expecting business to pick up on Saturday as the city gears up for the Pope’s journey around Dublin via Popemobile.\n\nThousands of spectators are expected to turn out for a glimpse of Pope Francis in transit before he heads to The World Meeting of Families Mass in Croke Park on Saturday evening.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"pope to begin historic visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Pope will receive a warm reception from the thousands of pilgrims who have travelled to be part of the occasion, he will also be met by protesters angry at how the church dealt with multiple clerical sex abuse scandals that have damaged trust in the religious institution and seriously weakened its influence on Irish society.\n\nFrancis will meet a number of abuse victims in a private meeting amid expectation he will use his public utterances elsewhere to confront the emotive issue.\n\nEarlier this week, the Pope wrote a 2,000-word letter to Catholics in which he condemned the crime of sexual abuse by priests and subsequent cover-ups.\n\nThe Pope demanded accountability in response to fresh revelations in Pennsylvania in the United States of decades of misconduct by clerics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\n\n\nFrancis is ostensibly in Ireland to attend the World Meeting of Families (WMOF) – a major global church event focused on promoting family values.\n\nHowever, he will also fulfil a number of other engagements, including meetings with President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.\n\nWith Ireland in the midst of a high-profile homelessness problem, the Pope will also meet a number of impacted families at a centre run by a religious order.\n\nAround 100,000 people are expected to line the streets of Dublin city centre on Saturday afternoon as the Pope passes through in his famous Pope Mobile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerchandise of Pope Francis on sale in Dublin (Aaron Chown/PA)\n\n\n\n\nIn the evening he will join 80,000 pilgrims at a musical festival in the landmark Croke Park Gaelic Athletic Association stadium.\n\nOn Sunday the Pope will fly west to Co Mayo where he will follow in the footsteps of John Paul II and take part in a religious service at a Holy shrine in Knock.\n\nHe will then return to Dublin for the closing centrepiece of the WMOF event – an outdoor Mass in front of an expected congregation of half a million people.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"volunteers expect hectic few days as final preparations for pope visit begin","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

We will have some last-minute training before the rush starts.”\n\nMeanwhile, last-minute preparations were taking place at Phoenix Park on Friday.\n\nSteel barriers, meetings points, food vans and flags are all in place while construction staff were putting together the final pieces of the jigsaw to the main event.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn defends zionists comment as tories report him to standards watchdog","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I’ve lived in Britain all my life and I don’t need any lessons in history/irony.\n— Luciana Berger (@lucianaberger) \nAugust 23, 2018\n\n\n\n\nJewish Labour MP Luciana Berger had earlier said that the video contained “inexcusable comments” which made her feel “unwelcome in my own party”.\n\nShe wrote on Twitter: “The video released today of the leader of @UKLabour making inexcusable comments – defended by a party spokesman – makes me as a proud British Jew feel unwelcome in my own party.\n\n“I’ve lived in Britain all my life and I don’t need any lessons in history/irony.”\n\nShe was supported by fellow Labour backbenchers, with Newcastle North MP Catherine McKinnell tweeting: “Standing right with you @lucianaberger.”\n\nSedgefield MP Phil Wilson wrote: “Right beside you @lucianaberger.”\n\nIn recent weeks, the Labour leader has come under increasing pressure over a number of issues linked to anti-Semitism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the party’s definition of anti-Semitism, his 2014 visit to a Palestinian cemetery in Tunisia and meetings with those connected to the Palestinian cause.\n\nBut senior Labour figures defended the party leader, with shadow chancellor John McDonnell saying he had devoted his life to securing peace in the Middle East.\n\nMr McDonnell told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think this has all been taken out of context: whatever Jeremy has said throughout the years has always been about how to secure peace, particularly within the Middle East and also peace with justice for all concerned – both members of the Jewish community and also members of the Palestinian community.\n\n“In that context Jeremy has devoted his life, so I think this would take expressions out of context in that way are not helping.”\n\nHelen Grant, the Tory vice chairwoman for communities, has written to Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone asking that Mr Corbyn be investigated over the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelen Grant’s letter to the Parliamentary Standard’s Commissioner asking her to investigate Jeremy Corbyn (PA)\n\n\n\n\nThe Maidstone MP argues it contravenes Clause 17 of the MPs’ code of conduct, which states: “Members shall never undertake any actions which would cause significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons as a whole, or of its members generally.”\n\nShe said the comments had been branded “xenophobic and anti-Semitic” by the chairman of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, and praised by Nick Griffin, the former leader of the far-right British National Party.\n\nShe wrote: “Mr Corbyn has undoubtedly brought this House and its members into disrepute.\n\n“This country has rightly always demanded more from our parliamentarians.\n\n“It is clear that Mr Corbyn has not reached the bar set by the Code of Conduct for members, and I therefore ask that you investigate.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn reported to

I’ve lived in Britain all my life and I don’t need any lessons in history/irony.\n— Luciana Berger (@lucianaberger) \nAugust 23, 2018\n\n\n\n\nJewish Labour MP Luciana Berger had earlier said that the video contained “inexcusable comments” which made her feel “unwelcome in my own party”.\n\nShe wrote on Twitter: “The video released today of the leader of @UKLabour making inexcusable comments – defended by a party spokesman – makes me as a proud British Jew feel unwelcome in my own party.\n\n“I’ve lived in Britain all my life and I don’t need any lessons in history/irony.”\n\nShe was supported by fellow Labour backbenchers, with Newcastle North MP Catherine McKinnell tweeting: “Standing right with you @lucianaberger.”\n\nSedgefield MP Phil Wilson wrote: “Right beside you @lucianaberger.”\n\nIn recent weeks, the Labour leader has come under increasing pressure over a number of issues linked to anti-Semitism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the party’s definition of anti-Semitism, his 2014 visit to a Palestinian cemetery in Tunisia and meetings with those connected to the Palestinian cause.\n\nSenior Labour figures defended the party leader, with a spokeswoman for Mr Corbyn saying that he had been “referring to a group of pro-Israel activists misunderstanding and then criticising the Palestinian ambassador for a speech at a separate event about the occupation of the West Bank”.\n\nShe added that he “is totally opposed to all forms of anti-Semitism”.\n\nShadow chancellor John McDonnell also defended the Labour leader – saying he had devoted his life to securing peace in the Middle East.\n\nMr McDonnell told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think this has all been taken out of context: whatever Jeremy has said throughout the years has always been about how to secure peace, particularly within the Middle East and also peace with justice for all concerned – both members of the Jewish community and also members of the Palestinian community.\n\n“In that context Jeremy has devoted his life, so I think this would take expressions out of context in that way are not helping.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say august","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I’ve held several job-hunting talks for teens, and, at one of them, one teen boy said he didn’t have any professional work clothes to wear for a job interview.\n\n“His comments got me started thinking of ways to help teens or adults like him who could not afford business attire. I thought the best and least complicated way would be to offer work accessories for library patrons to borrow.”\n\nShe added that lots of patrons would ask to borrow folders to put their CVs and paperwork in, which made her think that a briefcase or a handbag would be better.\n\nMs Lee said she realised that feedback she got at her talks for teenagers made her realise that some young people had no idea what to wear for a job interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrarian Michelle J. Lee says some young people didn’t know they needed to dress smartly for job interviews before attending seminars at NYPL (NYPL/PA)\n\n\n\n\n“Some teens were surprised to learn that they should dress up for a job interview and they should not wear jeans, hoodies, or T-shirts,” she said.\n\n“I’ve also helped many teens and adults review their resumes at the library as well, so that was another sign of the need for the programme.”\n\nSo far, many of the accessories were bought with money donated by charitable organisations, although members of the public have donated items as well.\n\nMs Lee said: “Job-hunting is tough, and it can be even harder if you do not have the fashion accessories to make a good impression at the job interview.\n\n“Our main job at the library is to help people, and I hope to help teens or adults who cannot afford a briefcase, a handbag or tie gain access to one, gain more confidence in their presentation and ace that job interview.”\n\n“The ties could also be borrowed for other occasions, too, for prom, graduation, concert performance, audition or other formal event.”\n\nAnother initiative by the library was its “Grow Up” programme last year, which involved a series of life skills workshops.\n\nThey included subjects such as appropriate workplace attire for men and women, how to apply for university, healthy eating on a budget, and money management.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"these seals playing with a sunken boat are having so much fun","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

You’ve probably seen him in Sandinos, The Guildhall Taphouse, Rodden’s in Buncrana or the Grand Central.\n\nThe whole point of these articles is to highlight the importance of the local music scene and he and his brother Christy are widely regarded as innovators in the dance music fraternity, with tributes from Celtronic and other DJs piled up on Facebook since the terrible news seeped out last Saturday night.\n\nI’m a rocker myself and came quite late to the dance party, but God love him John did his best to educate me. \n\nHe had been for a number of years one of them Derry faces I was familiar with but had no name or conversation to put with it. \n\nOver the years of being his friend I was always amazed by the education he gave me, people I should at least give a chance to listen to and always revere Michael Jackson for he is the source of all that is good in music….at least it wasn’t The Beatles.\n\nWe eventually became friends over a shared love of music, films and a weird sense of humour. \n\nOur conversations always returned to music and would almost certainly contain the words Boards of Canada. \n\nAs a vinyl collector it was John who encouraged me to get into DJing myself so for all those who’ve endured my weird sets, it was his fault entirely.\n\nI spent many a night with him while he was on in Sandino’s and developed an appreciation for music.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027244572\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\nI would have otherwise never entertained, I attribute my love of Prince to his sets which goes to show a DJ has done their job right if they’ve turned at least one person on to something. \n\nJust as I’m writing this I wish I had referred to him as Jimmy Rabbitte from The Commitments at least once, he had been playing the Courteeners way before any of us had even heard of them and he was the first to realise they were s***.\n\nNot only did John entertain people with other people’s music but he made his own music, he never let me hear it though. \n\nI’m sure somebody out there has heard it and it won’t be lost. \n\nKnowing John the Greek as I did I’m sure it has his perfectionist stamp all over it.\n\nI could get carried away and paint him as a one-dimensional character and forget his many other loves, including the great outdoors and adventures. \n\nI have been privy to jumping in a car with John without actually asking for a plan and ending in Donegal for the day in absolute sobriety and perfect gratitude for the beautiful scenery and the many things we could do for free right on our own doorstep.\n\nI can’t miss the opportunity to point out two facts here, the first that John was actually a fairly decent barber, which leads to the second fact that once upon a time I used to have hair and he was my personal stylist – although he eventually admitted defeat and suggested accepting baldness and shaving it off!\n\nTributes have come in from all over, the bars and their staff he entertained in will miss him terribly, his ability to know what song to play isn’t that common, nor is the warmth and humour he exuded. His funeral was a testament to the love he showed the world with each of us leaving under no doubt that there is a time to moonwalk.\n\nI’ve waffled on enough and these memories are my own, but they are great memories and I will always look back with a smile. \n\nI’m glad I knew The Greek and I hope that your memories make you smile and hope our love is of comfort to Sophie, his parents and sisters Mia and Angela and their families.\n\n\n\nIf anyone reading this, musician or otherwise feels that they need help get in touch with Help Musicians here https://www.musicmindsmatter.org.uk/ or call 0207 239 9101 or contact Samaritans 028 7126 5511.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"public urged visit arts exhibitions held unusual spaces across derry","story":"\nThree visual arts exhibitions have opened in unexpected places across Derry, including a bar and a park\n\nThey are taking place in the Walled City Brewery, The Gate Lodge and Gywns Café in Brooke Park and The Fashion and Textile Centre.\n\nA further exhibition will take place in the Sion Stables in Sion Mills.\n\nIn the Walled City Brewery, Yarli Allison has created a fake news television broadcast that can be seen on a television in the bar.

If not, then they will fail to absorb and highlight, the true spirit of \u002768.”\n\nMr McKinney questioned why an application for the parade was put forward as early as March and whether Sinn Féin felt major civil rights\u0027 concerns, ‘not least a non-functioning government resulting in adverse social consequences, were irrelevant and had no great immediacy?’\n\nHe pointed to the significance of that date in Derry and the north’s history which is recognised by lowly-paid, unemployed, homeless and the disenfranchised as a ‘a turning point for radical political, social and economic reforms in Northern Ireland.’\n\n“October 5th 1968,” he explained, “is a date linked to an era of hope when pro-democracy citizens banded together to achieve equality for all sections of our population, following the examples of Gandhi and Dr. Martin L. King. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027244566\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\n“If this historic analysis is distorted by sectarianism it will transpire that there are no limits on what this organisation would do to \u0027legitimize\u0027 themselves.\n\n“The NICRA was a non-party political cross-community organisation which gave the people of Northern Ireland an aspiration that radical change was possible. It created a vehicle whereby all were enabled to participate in a non-violent manner.\n\n“It seems blatantly partisan for one political group, rather than adopting a broad-front approach to contemporary issues, to proceed with a demonstration that suggests an opportunistic attempt to usurp the date and message of NICRA in 1968.\n\n“If that is the case, as many former campaigners and others from a wide range of backgrounds believe, then they should be ashamed of distorting a seminal moment in the history of this place to attract short-sighted populist gain via unpredictable media attention, alongside the inherent dangers, e.g. uncontrollable violent elements.”\n\nIn response Sinn Féin provided a statement from Tyrone MP Francie Molloy who said the party ‘were and remain’ at the forefront of civil rights and social justice campaigns. \n\nHe commented: “Fifty years ago, likeminded people from all communities, including republicans – outraged by the routine injustice and sectarianism of the six county state - came together to form the Civil Rights movement.\n\n“To mark the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march in Derry, Sinn Féin have organised a commemorative march from Duke Street to Guildhall Square, along the original planned route of the march. \n\n“Republicans were to the fore of and remain to the fore of civil rights and social justice campaigns. We would welcome anyone who feels the same to join us.”\n\nSurviving leaders and supporters of the original march were said to have met last November in Belfast City Hall where they decided on a programme of events.\n\nIt is noteworthy, Mr McKinney said, that \u002768 veterans at the initial meeting unanimously voted down a public commemorative demonstration ‘to avoid what may have been interpreted as a coat-trailing exercise’ thereby avoiding any possible violence on the streets. \n\n“It was agreed that such incidents would be highly injurious to the civil rights\u0027 cause, with resultant harmful images of our struggling city and general population, via regional and global media,” he said.\n\nA three-day programme of events will run at the Guildhall from October 4-7 to mark the international Civil Rights Festival, commemorating the 50th Anniversary of Duke Street Civil Rights March, which will see the Irish President Michael D Higgins make a keynote address.\n\nThe event was launched by 50th Anniversary Civil Rights Commemoration Committee last week, and will explore the civil rights\u0027 legacy through documentation, conferences, films and other educational activities.\n\n\nABOVE - Aidan McKinney, far right, pictured with some of the key figures of the Civil Rights Movement with then then President Mary McAleese during her visit to the Guildhall in Derry to mark the 40th anniversary in October 2008.
