The event takes its name from the 1976 comedy movie The Gumball Rally and raises funds for youth projects.Cooper also reportedly chose the term ‘Gumball’ to describe the rally because iconic artist Andy Warhol used it to describe the way that the population chews up and eventually spits out pop culture like gum.The inaugural rally, in which Cooper and about 50 of his friends participated, took place between London and Rimini, Italy, passing through cities like Paris along the way.The 2001 rally, which stretched between London and Berlin, Germany, is often seen as a turning point for the race as its popularity and global awareness rose sharply around that time.In 2002, the rally moved from Europe to the United States, starting in New York City and ending in Los Angeles, California, passing iconic landmarks like the White House in Washington, D.C. and the Grand Canyon in Arizona along the way.In 2004, the race returned to Europe, taking place between Paris and Cannes, France. Sadly, the 2007 rally ended early after a traffic accident in Macedonia resulted in the deaths of two nonparticipants.The 2008 and 2009 rallies were held entirely in the United States while the 2010 rally was notably the first transatlantic race as participants were flown between Europe and the U.S. The 2014 and 2015 rallies also featured a similar transatlantic route, flying participants between Miami, Florida and Ibiza, Spain in 2014 and Stockholm, Sweden and Las Vegas in 2015.When is the 2018 Gumball 3000 Rally?The rally is set to begin on Saturday, August 4 and continue until Sunday, August 12.2018 Gumball 3000 Rally trophyTo commemorate the 20th anniversary of the rally, Asprey has made a new ‘Spirit of Gumball’ trophy to mark the event. Modelled after a vintage gumball machine, it will be revealed to the public at the rally’s official launch party in London.Asprey Chairman John Rigas expressed enthusiasm at being part of the celebrity motor rally, stating: ‘We are delighted to host Gumball at the Asprey Mayfair flagship and thrilled to join the Gumball 3000 rally. It is a very exciting route this year through beautiful parts of Europe and continuing through important cities in Japan, one of the most beautiful countries in the world.’Meghan Markle\u0027s birthday wish every year is inspired by her motherCulture Club tour 2018: All you need to know about the UK datesGreat British Bake Off 2018: Start date, judges, trailer and more revealedGumball 3000 Rally 2018: All you need to know about the 20th anniversary race from London to TokyoGame of Thrones star Maisie Williams launches Daisie appPrince Harry and Meghan Markle told friends \u0027if you talk to the press you\u0027re out\u0027Station 19 season 2: All you need to know about the Grey\u0027s Anatomy spin-offStephen Colbert slams Ivanka Trump on The Late Show asking \u0027what do you do?\u0027Could Love Island be axed because of Brexit? Fortnite\u0027s Week 4 challenges: Search between a gas station, soccer pitch and Stunt MountainFA Community Shield 2018 - Chelsea vs Manchester City: When is it and what TV channel is it on?As Jennifer Aniston and Kim Kardashian reveal their weight, here\u0027s what your favorite celebs weigh Who is Gul Panag?

Always more inspiration.’Also in 2016, shortly after she started dating Prince Harry, Markle wrote: ‘I am feeling so incredibly joyful right now, so grateful and content that all I could wish for is more of the same.’Two years earlier in 2014, Markle also expressed happiness on her website, writing: \u0027I am 33 years old today. And I am happy. And I say that so plainly because, well…it takes time. To be happy. To figure out how to be kind to yourself. To not just choose that happiness, but to feel it.\u0027So for my birthday, here’s what I would like as a gift: I want you to be kind to yourself. I want you to challenge yourself.\u0027I want you to stop gossiping, to try a food that scares you, to buy a coffee for someone just because, to tell someone you love them…and then to tell yourself right back. I want you to find your happiness.\u0027Markle used her blog as a platform to express her feelings about her personal life and past experiences growing up as well.

Markle used her now-defunct blog to express personal feelings and recount past experiences\u0027My 20s were brutal – a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as coolas hipas smartas “whatever” as everyone else.\u0027My teens were even worse – grappling with how to fit in, and what that even meant. My high school had cliques: the black girls and white girls, the Filipino and the Latina girls.\u0027Being biracial, I fell somewhere in between. So every day during lunch, I busied myself with meetings – French club, student body, whatever one could possibly do between noon and 1pm, I was there. Not so that I was more involved, but so that I wouldn’t have to eat alone,’ she wrote.For her birthday, Markle is reportedly planning to celebrate in Surrey at the wedding of Daisy Jenks and Charlie Van Straubenzee, one of Prince Harry’s best friends who also served as an usher at the Royal Wedding.Per Royal tradition, birthdays are usually low-key affairs celebrated at home.

Julia Bradbury inside her holiday home in Portugal before it was done up in a new six-part series for ITV          The Portugese property, which she purchased £10,000, looks unrecognisable after renovationsThe six-parter, which begins on Tuesday, discovers holiday hideaways in a treehouse, shepherd’s huts, a river boat, troglodyte caves, and other homes in more traditional bricks and mortar. The countries they were found in include Bulgaria, Spain, France, Hungary and the region that captured Julia’s heart – northern Portugal. She found herself there in May last year after giving up on her dream of buying in the Algarve, where property was well beyond her budget.The Little Blue House, as it’s known, became hers in June 2017. A dozen visits, some which saw Julia flying out from the UK, others involving a detour while on the road filming elsewhere in Portugal, helped ensure its renovation was finished by last September.          The Portuguese property Julia Bradbury bought for £5,700 and renovated for less than £5,000‘I saved money by haggling over the asking price and then cheekily requesting all the rustic furniture be included in the deal too. The final purchase price was £5,700. I spent about £900 on legal fees, and the remainder went on tradesmen and building materials. Spectacular mansion where the Queen\u0027s party planner made her...One in three back property to pay for retirement: Britons...Share this articleI allowed myself a contingency fund, and when I discovered the nastiest of plumbing problems – a cesspit under the bathroom – I was very glad of it.’As well as extensive plumbing, Julia had to have the house connected to mains electricity and rewired, the kitchen and bathroom refurbished and the whole place made snug and secure. In the show she is seen calling on her friend, TV salvage expert Max McMurdo, for ideas and practical help.‘I’m pretty handy with a sledgehammer, am happy to try tiling and anyone can paint a wall, but Max was the one who said, “Bradbury, I’ve found a way to turn your entire staircase around,” ’ she laughs.          Basics: The primitive but stylish kitchen sink area in Julia’s idyllic cottageAnother friend who speaks Portuguese also proved invaluable, liaising with builders and keeping neighbours informed of developments. ‘I can speak enough Portuguese to order a custard tart and a cup of coffee,’ says Julia. ‘As with any project anywhere, I had issues with builders, including one who tried to get us to install a lighting system that would have lit up a mansion, never mind my one-up, one-down cottage. We agreed a deal with him and then he disappeared anyway. That’s not the kind of problem you can solve with sign language.’Max’s innovative approach and zeal for recycling helped turn Julia’s cottage into a budget-friendly bolthole. ‘For example, he helped me create a pulley-system partition with bunk beds attached which slides across the master bedroom, iding one big room into two smaller spaces. The idea works well and it gives us – a family of five – the space we need,’ she says.Julia hopes to spend at least a couple of weeks a year in Portugal as she takes a break from her hectic filming schedule. Friends and family have an open invitation too.

It has led to repeated attempts by Left-wing activists in the pro-Corbyn Momentum group to sack her as MP for Liverpool Riverside.A former aide to Mr Corbyn told The Mail on Sunday that they had heard him describe Dame Louise sarcastically as \u0027the Honourable Member for Tel Aviv\u0027 when her name was mentioned. \u0027I was very surprised and when I asked other members of staff they said he often did it in private, though not to her face,\u0027 said the Labour insider.          The \u0027spiteful\u0027 jibe by the Labour leader was reportedly aimed at Louise Ellman (pictured)Another senior Labour source said Dame Louise was commonly referred to as \u0027the Hon Member of Tel Aviv\u0027 by members of Mr Corbyn\u0027s staff. \u0027If her name crops up, or she appears on the office TV, they\u0027ll say, \u0027There she goes again, the Honourable member for Tel Aviv.\u0027 They can\u0027t stand her.\u0027 Last night, Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle, condemned Mr Corbyn\u0027s \u0027spiteful\u0027 comment.Born into a Jewish family in Manchester, Dame Louise, 72, was chairman of the Jewish Labour Movement until 2016 and is vice chairman of the Labour Friends of Israel. She denounced Mr Corbyn for hosting a Holocaust Memorial Day event during which the Israeli government was compared to the Nazis.In 2016, she backed a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn by rebel Labour MPs.A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said last night the claim that he had called Dame Louise \u0027the MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 was \u0027a fabrication\u0027.The disclosure of Mr Corbyn\u0027s role at the 2012 pro-Palestine rally follows claims last week that he chaired a meeting in Parliament in 2010 in which a speaker compared Israel\u0027s actions to the Nazis.Video footage of the 2012 meeting hosted in Conway Hall, Holborn, London by the Palestine Solidary Campaign shows the poem Love Letters To Gaza being recited by an actress. It was reportedly applauded by Mr Corbyn. The poem refers to an attempt by an unofficial \u0027freedom\u0027 flotilla of ships to break the blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip in 2011.It includes the lines: \u0027It is not now the Nazi state but Israel that blocks the seas.It is not Auschwitz that stops the ship that carries hope and messages,But those that might have died there....The victims are now the torturers.\u0027Mr Corbyn was also highly critical of Israel in his speech at the meeting, which featured a backdrop comprising a map showing Palestine in place of Israel.Labour\u0027s anti-Semitism revolt grew last night as Emily Benn, granddaughter of late Left-winger Tony Benn, said the only way to solve Labour\u0027s anti-Semitic rift was to sack Mr Corbyn.His statement was \u0027utter rubbish\u0027, tweeted former Labour parliamentary candidate Ms Benn, niece of senior Labour MP Hilary Benn.          \u0027To refer to me as the \u0027MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 is to challenge my loyalty to this country,\u0027 said Dame Louise Ellman of Corbyn\u0027s comment\u0027No responsibility taken for the anti-Semitism and those anti-Semites he has supported for years.

In her tweet, Ms Laing said she had had a ‘busy and productive week’ in the UK. A delighted Mr Mnangagwa was first to respond on Twitter, telling her that Zimbabwe’s prospects were ‘as bright and positive as your wonderful scarf’.Ex-Zimbabwean cabinet minister Jonathan Moyo accused Ms Laing of wearing a ‘dictator’s voodoo scarf’ and endorsing a ‘mass murderer’.An ally of Mr Chamisa told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Putting lipstick on a crocodile shouldn’t work, but it didn’t stop the ambassador trying.UK to DOUBLE aid cash handouts: Bill for debit card scheme...Share this article‘Everyone who has cosied up to this monster should be ashamed after his narrow win. He could have lost if more powerful people had stood up to him.’Ms Laing dismissed criticism of her scarf as ‘absurd conspiracy theories’. It was a ‘Christmas present from the designer’ and she ‘had it long before anyone else’.She was ‘not supporting anyone or anything other than a better future for Zimbabwe’, she said. She also denied backing police violence.There was similar criticism in 2016 when a photograph of a beaming Ms Laing and Mr Mnangagwa appeared after her ‘courtesy call’ to his headquarters in Harare.The British Embassy denied Ms Laing had sided with Mr Mnangagwa, saying it had spent £24 million on trying to ensure a fair election.‘Would we bother if we wanted one candidate to win?’ said a British diplomat.The Foreign Office announced in June that Ms Laing is leaving Zimbabwe to become Ambassador to Nigeria. Insiders deny it is linked to the crocodile scarf affair.Supporters of Mr Chamisa say that President Mnangagwa’s victory was achieved by election fraud."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/04/22/4ED535B400000578-0-image-m-134_1533416638215.jpg","title":"Manchester United fans 110 shirt workers paid 64p hour","story":"    Female factory workers in Phnom Penh, Camboadia are paid just 64p per hour to produce Manchester United\u0027s jerseys for the 2018-19 season, a Mail on Sunday investigation revealed          The world\u0027s richest club are flogging the Adidas shirts, seen here worn by £450,000-a-week star Alexis Sanchez, to fans for a staggering £110The women claim they often endure harsh working conditions and in many cases can afford only slum housing. One worker said her family of four occupied a cramped room – costing £46 a month – in a house shared with three other families. Some complained of being berated by supervisors if they fail to produce at least 60 shirts an hour, occasionally as many as 100.And one woman claimed her eyesight was failing because she spends ten hours a day sewing the shirts\u0027 hems.\u0027All the people said I wanted to leave but it\u0027s not true\u0027:...Share this article"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/05/09/4ED8397500000578-6027405-image-a-10_1533458111258.jpg","title":"Fox says no deal Brexit likely agreement Brussels","story":"    The UK appears set to crash out of the European Union without a Brexit deal due to the \u0027intransigence\u0027 of the Brussels machine, Liam Fox (pictured) has claimed          Theresa May and her husband Philip arrive for a church service near to her Maidenhead constituency this morning\u0027We have set out the basis in which a deal can happen but if the EU decides that the theological obsession of the unelected is to take priority over the economic wellbeing of the people of Europe then it\u0027s a bureaucrats\u0027 Brexit – not a people\u0027s Brexit – then there is only going to be one outcome.\u0027He said Mr Barnier had dismissed the UK\u0027s proposals in the Chequers plan thrashed out by Theresa May and the Cabinet simply because \u0027we have never done it before\u0027.The Government has admitted its proposals are unprecedented, but Dr Fox said Mr Barnier\u0027s response \u0027makes the chance of no deal greater\u0027.Brexit is no joke, Lord Feldman rages at Michael Gove:...Share this articleThe Prime Minister held talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, cutting short her holiday to visit his summer retreat.And ministers including Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab have also engaged in diplomatic activity in Europe in recent days as the Government seeks to deal directly with inidual governments in an effort to keep the Chequers plan alive.In a sign that member states are being warned of the consequences of the failure to find a deal, Dr Fox said: \u0027It\u0027s up to the EU27 to determine whether they want the EU Commission\u0027s ideological purity to be maintained at the expense of their real economies.\u0027Meanwhile, former cabinet minister Priti Patel said Mrs May must ditch the Chequers plan, which would see a \u0027common rulebook\u0027 for goods with the EU – effectively tying the UK to terms set by Brussels.

Julia Bradbury inside her holiday home in Portugal before it was done up in a new six-part series for ITV          The Portugese property, which she purchased £10,000, looks unrecognisable after renovationsThe six-parter, which begins on Tuesday, discovers holiday hideaways in a treehouse, shepherd’s huts, a river boat, troglodyte caves, and other homes in more traditional bricks and mortar. The countries they were found in include Bulgaria, Spain, France, Hungary and the region that captured Julia’s heart – northern Portugal. She found herself there in May last year after giving up on her dream of buying in the Algarve, where property was well beyond her budget.The Little Blue House, as it’s known, became hers in June 2017. A dozen visits, some which saw Julia flying out from the UK, others involving a detour while on the road filming elsewhere in Portugal, helped ensure its renovation was finished by last September.          The Portuguese property Julia Bradbury bought for £5,700 and renovated for less than £5,000‘I saved money by haggling over the asking price and then cheekily requesting all the rustic furniture be included in the deal too. The final purchase price was £5,700. I spent about £900 on legal fees, and the remainder went on tradesmen and building materials. Spectacular mansion where the Queen\u0027s party planner made her...One in three back property to pay for retirement: Britons...Share this articleI allowed myself a contingency fund, and when I discovered the nastiest of plumbing problems – a cesspit under the bathroom – I was very glad of it.’As well as extensive plumbing, Julia had to have the house connected to mains electricity and rewired, the kitchen and bathroom refurbished and the whole place made snug and secure. In the show she is seen calling on her friend, TV salvage expert Max McMurdo, for ideas and practical help.‘I’m pretty handy with a sledgehammer, am happy to try tiling and anyone can paint a wall, but Max was the one who said, “Bradbury, I’ve found a way to turn your entire staircase around,” ’ she laughs.          Basics: The primitive but stylish kitchen sink area in Julia’s idyllic cottageAnother friend who speaks Portuguese also proved invaluable, liaising with builders and keeping neighbours informed of developments. ‘I can speak enough Portuguese to order a custard tart and a cup of coffee,’ says Julia. ‘As with any project anywhere, I had issues with builders, including one who tried to get us to install a lighting system that would have lit up a mansion, never mind my one-up, one-down cottage. We agreed a deal with him and then he disappeared anyway. That’s not the kind of problem you can solve with sign language.’Max’s innovative approach and zeal for recycling helped turn Julia’s cottage into a budget-friendly bolthole. ‘For example, he helped me create a pulley-system partition with bunk beds attached which slides across the master bedroom, iding one big room into two smaller spaces. The idea works well and it gives us – a family of five – the space we need,’ she says.Julia hopes to spend at least a couple of weeks a year in Portugal as she takes a break from her hectic filming schedule.

It has led to repeated attempts by Left-wing activists in the pro-Corbyn Momentum group to sack her as MP for Liverpool Riverside.A former aide to Mr Corbyn told The Mail on Sunday that they had heard him describe Dame Louise sarcastically as \u0027the Honourable Member for Tel Aviv\u0027 when her name was mentioned. \u0027I was very surprised and when I asked other members of staff they said he often did it in private, though not to her face,\u0027 said the Labour insider.

She denounced Mr Corbyn for hosting a Holocaust Memorial Day event during which the Israeli government was compared to the Nazis.In 2016, she backed a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn by rebel Labour MPs.A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said last night the claim that he had called Dame Louise \u0027the MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 was \u0027a fabrication\u0027.The disclosure of Mr Corbyn\u0027s role at the 2012 pro-Palestine rally follows claims last week that he chaired a meeting in Parliament in 2010 in which a speaker compared Israel\u0027s actions to the Nazis.Video footage of the 2012 meeting hosted in Conway Hall, Holborn, London by the Palestine Solidary Campaign shows the poem Love Letters To Gaza being recited by an actress. It was reportedly applauded by Mr Corbyn. The poem refers to an attempt by an unofficial \u0027freedom\u0027 flotilla of ships to break the blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip in 2011.It includes the lines: \u0027It is not now the Nazi state but Israel that blocks the seas.It is not Auschwitz that stops the ship that carries hope and messages,But those that might have died there....The victims are now the torturers.\u0027Mr Corbyn was also highly critical of Israel in his speech at the meeting, which featured a backdrop comprising a map showing Palestine in place of Israel.Labour\u0027s anti-Semitism revolt grew last night as Emily Benn, granddaughter of late Left-winger Tony Benn, said the only way to solve Labour\u0027s anti-Semitic rift was to sack Mr Corbyn.His statement was \u0027utter rubbish\u0027, tweeted former Labour parliamentary candidate Ms Benn, niece of senior Labour MP Hilary Benn.          \u0027To refer to me as the \u0027MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 is to challenge my loyalty to this country,\u0027 said Dame Louise Ellman of Corbyn\u0027s comment\u0027No responsibility taken for the anti-Semitism and those anti-Semites he has supported for years. Labour has become an institutionally anti-Semitic Party under Jeremy Corbyn.

Eating nightly at Leon was weird enough – then the problems really started ...Rachel Maclean saturates her work with the discordant visuals of a modern nightmare – insatiable emojis, petticoated twerkers, wax-faced techno monks chanting their desire for data. But it was Birmingham’s Bullring that gave the multimedia artist anxiety dreams of her own.Maclean, who is based in Glasgow and represented Scotland at last year’s Venice Biennale, spent a month working, eating and sleeping in Birmingham’s mammoth shopping centre, by the end of which she had completed a short and startling film based on her experience. Channel 4 had asked her to participate in a series called Artists in Residence, for which a performance artist was also embedded in a sex clinic and a portrait painter spent a season with West Bromwich Albion football club. Maclean’s immersive sojourn was, she recalls from the sanity-restoring distance of a year later, “the residency from hell”. She says that she has done her best to avoid shopping centres since the filming was completed in August 2017.Laughing in her Bridgeton studio, which is stuffed with wigs, masks and racks of the candy-coloured costumes that make up her instantly recognisable aesthetic, she says: “If you imagine the conventional idea of an artists’ residence: you go somewhere remote, you’re living with other like-minded people and cooking for each other and chatting about art. It’s the comfort zone. Being in the Bullring was completely the opposite.”With her background in satirising the excesses of consumer culture, as with the infantilised adults and horror children in 2015’s Feed Me, one might imagine that Maclean would have tougher armour than most, but the relentless visuals of consumption took their toll. “There’s something about shopping centres and the whole experience of advertising that is anxiety-inducing. It has to make you feel bad in order that you buy something to make yourself feel better. It’s an entire culture that necessitates dissatisfaction.” Feeding herself became a similarly suffocating experience: “I had Cafe Nero, Pret a Manger, and Leon. I had dinner every night at Leon and even the food can be saturated by that strange environment.”The film tracks Maclean’s thwarted attempts to engage creatively with her surroundings. The only brand that would allow her to film in its shop was Smiggle, purveyor of unicorn-embossed children’s stationery that shares much of its aesthetic with Maclean’s. Even then, she was limited to asking the manager two pre-approved questions: “Tell me about Smiggle?” and “How long have you worked here?” (It should be noted that Maclean remains entirely respectful of Bullring employees. Having worked in retail, she is well aware of the slog of customer service.)A year on from the residency, Maclean’s frustration is far more transparent than it is in the documentary. “Every idea I had and everything I tried to do gradually seemed less possible. What I hadn’t considered is that these places feel like a public space, but the minute you try to critique or satirise it you hit up against all these things: I wasn’t allowed to film in shops, I couldn’t make work inspired by certain shops legally – the possible avenues for making art were narrowed down. So eventually the only way was to make art about the level of censorship around these brands.”It was a worthy target, as Maclean points out. “A lot of large corporations are financially bigger than some nations, more powerful than governments, but if we weren’t permitted to satirise governments using their own iconography then that would seem like a hard level of censorship.”In the resulting film, Maclean uses prosthetics and a hand-stitched costume to recreate herself as the marauding Satisfaction Bunny, a nursery monstrosity with viciously sharp teeth, who romps through an alternate Bullring universe peopled with tantrum-throwing shoppers craving brands, their logos censored with pixels. Like her other work, the film uses green-screen technology and digital editing while Maclean herself lip-syncs to a prerecorded soundtrack. The final piece of work is, if anything, enriched by her struggles her tangible rage, in particular at the way women’s bodies are variously used by consumer capitalism, remains undiminished. Not that Maclean’s work could ever be described as po-faced: it is infused with playfulness and cheek.“I’ve always thought dressing up was fun, ever since I was a kid,” she says. “Gender identity, particularly for women, traps you into a very narrow, restrictive idea of what beauty is, but dressing up and performance allow you to play with it.”Maclean’s costumes are artworks in themselves, exhaustingly elaborate, made in garish colours, with jarring details such as accentuated teeth, overly wide eyes or melting skin. “There’s a strange power in the grotesque, instead of trying to achieve beauty – and the standards of beauty as set at this level where it is entirely unachievable, and purposely so because if it was achievable you maybe wouldn’t want to keep buying these things to look better. But grotesqueness can be achieved quite easily and purposefully. There’s something cheeky that I find strangely empowering in being these grotesque characters.”Given Maclean’s ad-busting hinterland, it’s perhaps a wonder that any shopping centre allowed her within its bounds. She says that Channel 4 and Firecrest, the producers, sounded out a number of venues before the Bullring agreed. “I don’t think I ever got to the bottom of why they said yes,” she says.Her interactions with Pete Cooper, UK director of Hammerson, the property company that owns the Bullring, were her greatest disappointment, she says. But they were also fairly predictable, considering his position: one scene shows his flabbergasted expression after viewing Maclean’s Bullring artwork for the first time. “That’s pretty interesting!” he squeaks. And Maclean is also refreshingly aware of when her own artist’s ego impinges on her response. “You go into a shopping centre and you’re almost inside the belly of the whale but in the best circumstances you give the whale indigestion. And talking to Pete, his response was so strangely patronising that it gave me this feeling, ‘You can just absorb this, can’t you?’ And that’s the scary thing about consumer capitalism – the extent it can absorb things.”It was a shock after the cosy confirmation bias of her usual artistic milieu. “Within the art world, you have a certain ego because you’re among people who agree with you that we’re counter to this culture and can do things that speak of something that’s critical of it. The minute you’re dumped into this world you feel so strangely powerless.”She describes seeing “feminist”-branded T-shirts on the girls’ clothing rails in Primark: “One of the really good things recently is that feminism is back on the agenda and it has become something that young women are talking about, but look how easily a radical politics can be absorbed into consumerism, and can those two things coexist?”Responses to her residency from the public were more galvanising, she says, despite the Birmingham Mail’s headline: “What this bizarre looking woman is doing in the Bullring”.“That was really good fun. We had loads of different people in and out.” Maclean had set herself up in a shop space for the month, inviting members of the public in to comment on early iterations of her film props, watch her earlier work on screen and answer the question she plastered across her shop window in huge yellow letters: Are you satisfied? She also recruited extras to run around the Bullring for her final shoot. “Galleries can seem intimidating to people, while shops feel as if they are welcoming you in. So that was nice about being in a shopping centre – you didn’t have the aura of exclusivity around what you were doing.“That was why I was really keen to do a TV programme,” she says, “because I feel right now is a difficult time for public art in the UK. A lot of institutions are losing their funding and it feels like the whole position of artists and institutions that are not solely commercial is becoming really precarious. You want to put the case for the importance of art for the public.”Born in 1987, Maclean grew up in Dollar, Clackmannanshire, and studied at Edinburgh College of Art where she completed her BA in drawing and painting in 2009, before moving to Glasgow.Nonetheless, she underlines the grind of working for low pay. “You can get quite worn down if you’re putting on a show and people enjoy it and you fulfil the brief you’ve been given but you can’t pay your rent, or you’ve always got to have another job to keep things going. Practically, it’s exhausting.“The problem is I’m just hooked on making art, I don’t think I can stop, and I’ve thought about it. I’ve always made things since I was a kid and I don’t quite know how to cope with it!” • Shopping Centre: Artist in Residence is on Channel 4 on 5 August, and then available on All 4."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ba6f52f2f440e3381ca4662123a6610ce8f2fb4/0_727_3738_2242/master/3738.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa0a0ecf6a2e506331e71bbb207e94ff","title":"the big picture going nowhere in new yorks outer boroughs evelyn hofer","story":"Poised in a state of perfect equilibrium, the young man with the bike is going nowhere. To explain his predicament and his dejected air, just look at his location. He is standing in Queens, across the river from Manhattan although the Queensboro Bridge connects the factories and taxi garages of Long Island City with the penthouses and roof gardens of the Upper East Side, he remains stranded in what snooty Manhattanites call “the outer boroughs”.In the hazy distance, the skyscrapers of midtown Manhattan are out of reach and almost out of sight. Under the bridge’s anchorage there is another barrier – the ruins of the asylums, quarantine hospitals and penitentiaries on Roosevelt Island, a sliver of rock in the East River where New York once confined those it considered insane, infectious or unrespectable. In the 1920s Mae West was briefly locked up there as punishment for being too sexy (though she revenged herself by romancing the prison warden). Half a century after Evelyn Hofer took the photograph, the exclusion zone has widened. That grassy verge has been privatised: the Queens shoreline is now occupied by a glazed rampart of forbiddingly expensive apartment towers.

Maybe, once the shutter clicked, he rode meekly home to the hinterland.

In just the same way the performers’ pavement-blocking antics inexplicably seem to. “Oh look, how marvellous – he’s swallowing fire and he needs a haircut! Let’s go and stand around that for a bit. Oh great! I mean, it’s a bit repetitive but, in my mind’s eye, I’m watching us watch this and it’s exactly how I imagined the weekend. Pity about the overpowering smell of paraffin.”Once you hit middle age, you might as well be honest about what you dislike – unless you’re running a political party, in which case it can be more prudent to keep it to yourself. Intellectually, I know that buskers probably possess the same average level of niceness as the wider population, but if I got chatting to one and they actually seemed nice, I would be doubly charmed because of my prejudice that they were going to be a twat. That would show me, wouldn’t it?! Well, I’m not worried – I bet they’re all twats.I’ve never liked buskers and street performers because I’m instinctively very anti-fun. Group fun, that is. The social totalitarianism of the organised, collective, forcedly inclusive fun activity has always made me come over all nervous and contrarian. I don’t mind private fun, and I’m not just talking about masturbation – it could be as simple as reading a book while eating a club sandwich, a long evening of drinking with three or four people who hold exactly the same opinions as you, or watching a Poirot you’ve only seen twice. That’s all great, but group fun, and I’m not just talking about orgies, makes me sneer.And those Edinburgh fringe or Covent Garden buskers and street performers completely tap into that. Surrounded by thick semi-circles of smiling tourists, everyone having a brilliant time because they’re all “up for” the same thing, they make me shudder. “Is the whole world to be turned into a disco?!” I want to shout. “Stop joining in, you big group, and go back to singly joining in with my approved urban activity of scuttling along the streets, eyes glued to the pavements to look out for dog shit.”That’s probably why I don’t mind unsuccessful buskers so much. The ones on their own in a tube station corridor, mournfully strumming Oasis next to some 2ps, provide a much more relaxing aesthetic, in my view. And these are only aesthetic preferences I’m expressing, I should probably clarify. I don’t like buskers in the same way I don’t like barn conversions and herbal tea and The X Factor. I don’t actually think they should be\u0026nbspbanned.But that’s only because I’m an incredibly nice guy, let me add, because they’ve really pushed me to the limit. Over my many years of taking loss-making comedy shows up to Edinburgh, the buskers and street performers of the Royal Mile were a stinging rebuke. Every hungover morning, as I slunk along trying to give out flyers, the bored coughing of the dozen punters who’d watched me bleat clever-clever attempts at wordplay on the previous afternoon still ringing in my ears, the buskers would be there. And the jugglers and sword-swallowers and magicians – all surrounded by adoring throngs.So vast were the crowds they drew, I could seldom get close enough to hear what they said between songs or feats, but I could hear the laughs they got, and then the “oohs” and then the applause. “And they haven’t even hired an incredibly expensive and hot room to perform in!” I fulminated (a small venue at the Edinburgh fringe will, as a result of the cumulative body heat of the audiences and performers occupying it for 14 hours in every 24, reach a temperature roughly halfway between that of a sauna and what Delia Smith describes as “a cool\u0026nbspoven”).“They’ve just made an impromptu theatre out of a pedestrianised bit of street and everyone is loving it because it’s free! So much so that they’re going to express their appreciation for its freeness by paying! It’s like the direct inverse of asking for your money back!”And through the green envious mist – and I’m not just talking about the Scottish weather – I could clearly perceive the performers’ enjoyment of the attention and their success, a very tough thing for a mean-spirited person like me to endure. Really, I should sue for being put through that.So the news that these guys are now edging out of the cash economy is peachily annoying. The fact that they relied on cash was one of the few things I’d previously have said in their favour. It feels like my enemy and my enemy’s enemy have just made friends.Much more than I dislike buskers, I hate the way the superficial convenience of contactless payments, to both purchaser and vendor, is luring us into thoughtlessly accepting the end of cash as the fundamental form of money. If we get to the point where hardly anyone uses it, it will soon cease to be usable. That would bring an end to the most ancient and convenient means we have of anonymously buying, selling and giving.Suddenly all of our payments would be traceable, and stoppable, by governments and credit providers. All access to the numbers in a computer denoting how well off we are will be completely dependent on the competence and goodwill of large, deeply flawed organisations. Maybe it’s inevitable, maybe it’s even broadly for the best, but it shouldn’t happen without an enormous amount of public scrutiny. And when buskers start going contactless, it feels like that’s not happening.On the plus side, the traceable nature of the payments will presumably make it harder for those guitar-playing hippies to completely avoid tax. So well done, the authorities – they’re certainly getting to grips with that issue. Admittedly, Amazon, Google, Apple and the non-doms still represent a challenge, but we’re really cracking down on the street performer sector of the economy. Screwing a bit more out of travelling players will have a powerful “trickle-up” effect that will surely benefit us all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a91fbcbf9e6e821c1949009e55778de57ebe753a/103_14_5417_3250/master/5417.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=734a4f0198ecea406336ae56f6c6fb36","title":"ten friends two decades same holiday house it really shouldnt work","story":"I don’t like spending time with people, but to have a bunch of friends willing to stomach weeks of me, playing the same games and having the same arguments is specialAt the table, Andy is making a seven-cheese and meat sandwich that defies belief. In the hallway, Rhik is cracking himself up by wilfully mispronouncing Billie Piper’s name. Billy Pooper. Billy Pooper. Selina enters now, talking loudly about a colleague’s affair, as if she is on the phone, but she is not on the phone. Abandoning his book, a summery hardback about the history of slavery, Amish Tom asks if anyone wants to go for a bike ride. “Apparently, there’s a market town 50km from here.” Kate, who treats any mention of exercise as the punchline to a joke, sprays him with baguette crumbs.Going on holiday with friends is a risk. People have different musical tastes, rise at incompatible hours, follow particular diets they have varying ideas of a good time, reasonable budgets and who it’s OK to bring back to the flat and at which hours. Holidays are when you discover that aspects of people you previously liked are quite grating after five hours. Or that they have unfamiliar sides to their character, leading to the counterintuitive feeling you know them less well than before, and a post-holiday distance emerges while you recalibrate the relationship. It’s hard going on holiday with your mates. Or at least it should be.I have been going on the same holiday, to a house in France, for nearly two decades, with the same 10 people. Advertising encourages us to think of holidays as a chance for discovery and adventure novel experiences with high Instagram traction. Yet my holidays are identical, every time. The height of adventure is a hornet on the upstairs landing. I dimly remember the place being in an attractive patch of countryside, but could be wrong, because I never leave the house when I’m there.It’s inexplicable that I could spend this much time in company. I generally find people a bit much. Couldn’t eat a whole one. An hour is plenty, then a day off for recovery. The only reason this tradition works is that there is no itinerary, and no expectation other than that everyone be their authentic selves, for better or worse. Anti-socialness is accepted, as are unprompted bouts of grappling. The playlists are bananas, though recently we’ve settled on a zonal compromise: Yo La Tengo and Nancy Sinatra in the kitchen, Bruno Mars and Drake by the pool. Kate, a nurse, is free to talk about teratomas in eye-watering detail while serving up artichoke hearts in cheese sauce. Andy can extemporise on the human condition, but if tree surgeon Pete approaches and asks if I want to play ping pong for six hours, I won’t even sign out of the conversation I’ll just stand up and go.I’m one of those excellent people who tends to drop his friends as soon as there’s an outbreak of love in his life. Who will disappear for six months, or three years. This place is always here when I return, as are these people. Our culture is less interested in friendship, assuming romantic and familial stories to be more intense. Yet there’s nothing to equal the warm bath of friendship, particularly this holiday variety. To be truly accepted – even as a perpetually hungover bad loser in card games, with inefficient washing-up technique. To have a group of people know you intimately, historically and decide – without the glue of shared debt or organ compatibility – that they can stomach weeks of you, embroidering the same old stories, having the same old arguments, in the same old shorts? To me, that’s beautiful.This weekend saw the launch of Vans x Van Gogh, a range of skateboard clothing printed with the tortured Dutch artist’s most famous works. I’m on board: primarily for the name. It’s like one of those jokes that occurs to you in conversation, and is so good you can’t help but make it (even if it jeopardises a friendship or upsets your boyfriend). This is the business version, in which the shoe company stumbled on a piece of wordplay so compelling, it couldn’t not make it (a lucrative merchandise opportunity).Some may find this commodification of Van Gogh’s genius banal. Proof of our narcissistic inability to appreciate art, except to enhance our own brand. That’s a good point. However, the collection looks absolutely boss. Sunflowers, Skull and Self Portrait will feature on bomber jackets, backpacks, and sneakers, with the soles replicating Vincent’s characteristic brushstrokes. Personally, I can’t wait for sports-luxe collaborations with other old masters. Pablo Adidasso? Jackson Reeboks? Toulouse-Lacoste? Great art is inextricably bound up with commerce and identity, anyway. The wealthy have always reduced it to a financial asset, or décor or – by commissioning their own portraits – themselves. You can have the Sistine Chapel in your hall, so why not Mona Lisa on a bum bag? It’ll wipe the smirk off her face.OK, maybe it is tragic, but that’s capitalism. It’s a problem that we hold artists to a higher standard than the world they have to survive in. Vincent was a typical millennial snowflake, who died penniless and overwhelmed, his special talent unrecognised by everyone around him. Why has the Van Gogh Museum, dedicated to preserving his legacy, signed up for the youth-appealing fashion range? Must be the Monet!I can’t stop laughing about the Turkish zoo accused of painting a donkey to look like a zebra. Hee-haw. Isn’t this an Only Fools and Horses storyline? Or maybe Scooby-Doo? How did it think it would get away with it? Most zebras aren’t smudged. It’s not even original: the practice originated in Gaza, where they’ve been painting donkeys’ ears for, well, donkey’s years. The best part is that, when quizzed about it, the Turkish zookeepers stickingstuck to their story, like a man with a wonky toupee. As for the zonkey, if she hasn’t been given the name Debra , someone really should lose their job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa763be901ab108ab7d10b3bf5dc5d85f3aa23b1/0_194_4416_2649/master/4416.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7560dbe7bae882784c959578cdcaee3f","title":"the guardian view on apples valuation a digital milestone","story":"Apple is now valued at more than a trillion dollars on the New York stock exchange. It is not the first company to be so huge if inflation is taken into account but it is the first that is not in the oil business. The other ground-breaking fact about its wealth is that it employs only about a quarter as many people as PetroChina, which is probably the world’s largest company. These two facts taken together suggest the direction of the digitalised economy: fewer people are going to make more money. It is still too early to see the ultimate destination, just as it would have been impossible to foresee all the effects of the oil economy in 1918. Transport was obviously going to be revolutionised then but who at the time could have\u0026nbspforeseen the world transformed by plastics?The oil revolution accelerated the shrinkage of the physical world that coal-powered transport – steamships and railways – had started in the 19th century. Air travel and motor transport transformed peacetime economies and the means of waging war. They changed the way we understood the physical world, since distance on its own\u0026nbspnow no longer meant that anywhere was hard to reach. The digitalisation revolution seems to have abolished social distance in a similar way. But social distance has not been replaced by social closeness. Instead, we have an abrasive and anxious proximity with\u0026nbspstrangers around the world. In the world of social media we are all up in one another’s faces.Apple has profited from this revolution in two rather\u0026nbspcontradictory ways. It was the company that invented the smartphone. Without the smartphone and\u0026nbspits ravenous screen it is very hard to imagine the modern social media scene. So Apple bears some responsibility for our present state of constant distraction and confused excitability in which everything is sensational but nothing really matters. But in recent years it has also started to sell the ability to cut oneself off from the online world, at least in bursts. The Silicon Valley elite have long distrusted the effects of smartphones on their own children, however much they wanted to sell them to the rest of the world. So Apple’s phones now offer to limit the time you spend on any particular website while its web browser makes ad blocking\u0026nbspeasier.Both these can be understood as ways to strike against rival tech giants that make their money from advertisements, primarily Facebook and Google. But they are also examples of Apple’s focus on user experience, which has been one of the foundations of its fortune. Sometimes this corresponds to nothing visible to the outside world. Just as cars are sold as an\u0026nbspexpression of the buyer’s personality, Apple products have been sold as a story about the user: one\u0026nbspwho thinks differently – and spends rather more. But it has\u0026nbspalso often reflected a real elegance and ease\u0026nbspof use\u0026nbspdifficult to imitate elsewhere. In the end, one reason why Apple is so immensely profitable is that it makes things people really want to buy, and to\u0026nbspgo on\u0026nbspbuying.Apple has more in common with other digital companies than ides them. All use remarkably few workers to generate their enormous profits. All operate an internal class system, which concentrates power in very few hands. None have any unions worth\u0026nbspspeaking of. All rely on the unglamorous work being done far from California, usually by subcontractors. All shuffle their profits around the world in an endless game of “Find the lady” with national tax authorities – a factor that should not be overlooked when it comes to asking why they are so immensely profitable. If this is the model of the company of the future, it will have consequences we have not yet learned how to manage.The downside of the oil-based economy is now obvious all around us. The symptoms of apparently uncontrollable climate change have become undeniable. Cities are choked with polluting traffic while the seas are choked with plastics made from oil. Whole countries have been devastated by oil riches. The digital revolution seems, so far, much more benign. But the loss of trust that social media both causes and exploits may one day be seen as another form of unforgivable pollution."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8610cdb217ba86a4832a393c428cd0a47e2a36e5/0_2_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d58316156fb9f4561b05debaa72f1706","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of soar","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘soar’The closing date is Wednesday 8 August at 10am.

Steve Ormerod, a professor of ecology at Cardiff University’s school of biosciences, who has personally studied the 14 streams for 34 years, characterised the loss of freshwater organisms as a “hidden tragedy”. He said: “Freshwater ecologists are seriously concerned at the plight of the world’s rivers, lakes and wetlands, and at the rate at which they’re losing plants and animals of many types.“Yet, many people are unaware of this ongoing tragedy hidden beneath the water surface. Our results show that the buildup to species extinction can start in a subtle way, for example, where climate change causes numbers to decline before sudden disappearance.” Ormerod said that while urban rivers were becoming more healthy, with animals and birds such as Atlantic salmon and dippers returning, rural streams and rivers were not doing as well.“We need to step up action to prevent these losses and work of this type will help to inform the best approaches while providing a timely wake-up call.”The data that the Observatory has gathered over the decades shows the loss or sharp decline of specialist organisms such as predatory flatworms, stoneflies and caddisflies.Their struggle does not attract the same headlines as the extinction of a spectacular mammal or bird, but their loss or decline may fundamentally change the nature of the streams they inhabit – and therefore affect other animals, such as the brown trout, that are to be found in the Llyn Brianne streams. One species that has been lost is the flatworm Crenobia alpina, a cool-water stream predator. The creature vanished from Llyn Brianne and much of Wales when the temperature of the streams rose, although it has recently been found again in a cold stream that emerges from a cave in the Brecon Beacons.The project originally grew out of a scheme to protect sea trout. In 1973, the Llyn Brianne dam was opened at the headwaters of the river Tywi to supply water to much of south Wales. There was alarm that the dam would stop sea trout from reaching their breeding grounds, so an extravagant scheme was hatched to trap them, put them in lorries and transport them to streams on the other side of the dam.After that, the Llyn Brianne Observatory project was launched in 1981 with its first focus on acid rain. The streams, which feed into the reservoir, were carefully chosen to represent a variety of types. Some trickle down from exposed hillside grazed by sheep, others plunge through the conifer forests, which are periodically harvested, and a few emerge from the remnants of oak woodland. Over the years, hundreds of scientists have visited the 14 streams to take part in many experiments. There are some ingenious innovations. For example, a stainless steel cascade runs parallel to one of the streams. Stream water is piped into it, allowing experiments to take place in the controlled environment of the cascade. There is no power source and if the temperature needs to be raised in the cascade researchers can pipe it through manure provided by one of the local farmers.Despite Ormerod’s long spell studying the streams, his enthusiasm is undiminished. When he took the  on a tour of the observatory, he pushed through thick undergrowth and scrambled down steep banks into streams with his net. The technique is to scrape the bottom of a stream with a boot and collect the creatures that are disturbed. A single scoop collects hundreds of organisms. Despite some of the data, Ormerod remains optimistic. He points out that acid rain was the big worry when the oservatory was launched, but that crisis has been tackled. “What that illustrates is that even if you are facing a major environmental problem, taking the right action can lead to solutions. That’s an incredibly hopeful message.”He said the information the observatory was collecting would not halt climate change, but may lead to ways of adapting the landscape to mitigate the effects. “There’s a whole set of invisible elements at play. The changing rainfall pattern, temperature changes, recovery from the past effects of acid rain. They are made real by the information that comes out of the streams and the organisms we monitor. “What we are seeing is changes among rarer organisms and specialised organisms. They are starting to decline and that’s clearly consistent with the signals of climate change effect you see more broadly across the world. I think that early warning is an important one for us to see and heed,” Ormerod said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/343d68ded23a6b1c7559e692a95b9d892a0cf5ba/0_2766_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6624dbfa2c03d15fd258a11fe547d22","title":"this is what 70 looks like the new generation of beauty influencers","story":"Fed up with ageism in the industry, the most exciting new voices in beauty vlogging are over 60For years, the beauty blogging scene has been dominated by 20-something women in their bedrooms sharing their favourite products and techniques. Now, a new crop of beauty bloggers in their 60s and 70s are getting behind their laptop cameras to share the beauty hacks that work for them. Fighting the stereotypes of being seen as “old ladies”, they’re demanding the attention that the beauty industry has denied them.I decided to take on the beauty industry as a political act. It might sound grandiose but I’ve always loved make-up and in my 60s I felt angry with the industry and wanted to disrupt it. Casual ageism is rife. I was gobsmacked when Dior announced that Cara Delevingne was going to be the face of their new anti-ageing products. She’s 25. The outrage should have been loud but hardly anyone batted an eyelid. The industry language of “anti-ageing” is profoundly insulting. Adding that phrase to any product tells me, as a woman who is 70, that I must do everything in my power to stop this natural process.I started getting involved in beauty in my 60s when I noticed a lot of changes happening to my face. Take my eyes. Because bones shrink as you age, my eye sockets got deeper the skin on my eyelids became crêpe-y and my eyebrows became less prominent. I kept trying different products to adapt to the changes and spent money on good stuff because I thought it would be better, but so much turned out to be a waste. At no point was anyone from the beauty industry telling me what would work better on my older skin. They don’t want to show their products on a face that’s less than perfect.My most popular video is about eye and lip make-up for older women, and it has had more than 2m views. The products and techniques younger bloggers use just don’t work the same for older women. The beauty industry, like the fashion industry, designs for the perfect form – young skin. With older skin, you’ve got a loss of melanin that makes features fade, skin becomes dryer and make-up bleeds and doesn’t last as long. There’s a fashion at the moment for a feline flick with a dark, heavy line. If you tried a strong, straight line using a gel eyeliner on my eyelids, it would look ragged and messy.But as older women, we don’t have to follow what the young ones are doing. In my videos and with my products I suggest not trying to get a perfect black line. Instead, use a dark powder eyeshadow and push it into the base of the eyelashes with a tiny wedge brush, making it slightly smudgy. It looks lovely and is a real solution to the problem.Wearing make-up, for me, is about feeling able to face the day, not about looking younger. I like to wear nice clothes, do my hair, put my face on and feel the very best version of me that I can create. I love the transformation that make-up creates and I’m not ashamed to say it.Make-up is so much better quality and more fun than it used to be. When I was young, we didn’t have highlighters, bronzers and contouring. There was just lipstick and powder. I love to mix my make-up and browse the beauty shops that young people go to. I hate feeling forced to be old-lady like.A year ago, my granddaughter started to worry about me getting dementia because most of my older friends had started to. She wanted to keep me busy. So she quit her job and took me to Australia and we started making videos and posting them on YouTube as korea_grandma.The most popular videos have been my make-up tutorials. The first one was me getting ready for a visit to the dentist. I used a cheap lipstick that cost 1,000 won (about 70p) and a very old technique to curl my eyelashes where you heat a toothpick with a lighter and press it against the hairs. It’s very different to what young women do these days. The video has had more than 2m views and it made me well known online in Korea.In Korea, old women perm their hair, wear old people’s clothes and limit make-up to the basics. But it’s other old people that demand we stay that way, not young people.Because of YouTube, my life has turned around completely. I’ve seen so much of the world, been kayaking, eaten the most expensive food in Korea. Unfortunately my friends don’t even know how to get on YouTube so they don’t watch my videos. I like to watch younger people’s YouTube channels and get inspired. Sometimes I miss my younger days. I’ve continued making the videos because they make me happy. It’s just me being myself and having fun. People have stereotypes of how “old people” should do their make-up, but my make-up is far from that. And what I’m doing is giving other women courage to do what they want.youtubekorea_grandmaBack in 2013, I was watching some younger people’s vlogs on YouTube and when they talked about beauty I thought, “Well, gosh, I’ve been wearing make-up for 50 years, I’ve got a lot of experience, too. I wonder if I could do that.” I sat down in my son’s old bedroom and filmed myself. Then I researched how to upload a video. Two people watched it. But I didn’t care – I just kept going. I’ve now got 70,000 subscribers to Melissa55.I didn’t necessarily feel I had anything to offer anyone else. I’m an average person. Like so many other women in America, I got married, raised children, haven’t had a big career – but I did want to show that you can still feel good about yourself when you’re elderly. My generation’s not ageing like our mothers did – we wear jeans with holes in them and keep our hair long or go grey if we want.Over the last few years, more people have been searching online for videos of women over 50 doing make-up, and that’s really helped me and other older beauty vloggers to grow. My top make-up tip is to visit a beauty store and have a free makeover to find the right foundation for your skin type – it’s the base for everything else. I use a Laura Mercier oil-free one that gives me a glow. I’ve stopped applying powder altogether. For cleaning my face, I find regular terry washcloths too harsh, so I knit my own for the perfect texture. Skincare’s always been important to me and since my 30s I’ve used Retin A from my dermatologist.I’m friends with other older vloggers and we all buy the newest technology. We’ve learned how to edit nicely, add music, set up lighting. It takes time to do it well. We do get comments like, “You old hag, why don’t you get off YouTube?” But we continue to fight to be heard.It’s hard being an older woman in society in general. Much of our lives we did our duty and mattered to our children and it can be a challenge to feel relevant. Advertisers don’t recognise us. When we look at the TV or at models, we don’t recognise those girls. It bothered me when Estée Lauder used Kendall Jenner to advertise wrinkle cream when she doesn’t have a wrinkle on her.Most of my audience is women my age. I’ve become close friends with many of them and that kinship is part of the reason I make the videos. There’s a group of us that met online and talk every day. We lift and support each other, whether it’s problems with kids or health or husbands, or just feelings about getting older. It means everything to me.My children don’t really like me doing beauty vlogging but they’ve learned to accept it. If you have the right attitude about it, this is a time in your life where you feel a lot of freedom to try new things.youtubevolmel55I started my YouTube channel because I couldn’t find many people reviewing wigs for hair loss. Lots of younger women were reviewing wigs for fashion, but I didn’t see anyone else going through all the heartache and pain of losing their hair and turning to wigs as a necessity. When I started, my two children were like, “Mum, are you really going to be on YouTube with your bald head and no make-up?” I thought, “Yes, because you don’t see it and we need to be represented.” It shouldn’t be anything to be ashamed of. It happens. People lose their hair, especially women of colour.My hair loss began in my late 30s. Then when my son went through chemotherapy aged 15 for cancer, I cut my hair off too, so that he could feel more comfortable. With the stress of his chemo, plus just ageing, and years of wearing weave and braids, my hair didn’t really grow back. But I decided I wanted to be an example to others that you can get through it. I received so many emails from women, men, even young children, who thanked me for being out there. Even though my channel wasn’t drawing the masses, I was helping others.My subscribers started asking if I could do make-up for bald women and older women. For example when you wear a wig, you can’t put make-up on parts of your forehead because it stops the wig sticking. You also have to think about how bright you want your make-up to be, depending on the wig’s colour and style.My channel now focuses on beauty for older women and is called Ageless Beauty. I use the term pro-ageing rather than anti-ageing, because I’m not trying not to age. For me it’s about skin and hydration. I’ve been using Ambi Skincare every day for over 30 years and that’s kept the elasticity in my skin. When I went through the menopause I shared tips like putting powder on before foundation to help prevent make-up melting when you’re having hot flashes. Although sometimes nothing can stop it.It takes a lot of courage to remove your hair and make-up and put yourself on YouTube to be judged and criticised. There are days when I don’t want to turn the camera on, but by the time I’ve finished the video I’m pumped up. Make-up and hair can change how you feel and get you out of a funk, and I love showing that.For four years, I pretended I was 59. I just didn’t want to embrace that 60-year-old milestone. I’d worked at Microsoft for a long time and it’s a young culture. While I felt vibrant, I was afraid that other people would view me differently.Then when I was 64, I was on holiday and had a nasty fall. I was in bed for five days and it gave me time to think. I realised I’d fallen because I wasn’t connected to my body and to the real me. It was time to accept that I had to look after myself, physically and emotionally, to let the old me go. I knew there had to be other women holding back from making that leap into 60. From that bed, I launched Sixty and Me via Facebook.It took off immediately. I work with my son and his wife and we produce content for women over 60. From listening to the community, we saw older women feeling invisible in society. People see them differently and when they look in the mirror, they see themselves differently. The beauty articles I write and videos I make address this.I like to empower women and pull them into our shared experience. I’ll look into the camera and say, “I wouldn’t worry too much about us having wrinkles under our eyes, because that’s just what happens when we turn 60, right?” My beauty videos are about simple things. For example, I don’t use concealer to erase the lines around my eyes any more – what’s the point? It can’t do it. But I do use it to mask shadows when I haven’t had enough sleep. If you apply it quite low, almost above your cheekbone, it reflects back up to your eye and hides the darkness.A lot of women in their 60s are dealing with a reinvention that s relationships, family and work. In my late 50s I went through a orce and in the 2008 financial crash I lost my house and savings. Many older women are also very creative. My approach to make-up is: “Just try it.” You see the years ticking and you know there’s less ahead than there is behind, and this is a time to really express your true nature. When people say they want to age gracefully, I think, “How about magnificently? Or creatively?” Pink hair. That’s what I’m trying next.Now when people ask me how old I am and I say almost 70, they stop and say, “Oh wow, you don’t look it.” Remembering Gloria Steinem’s quote, I reply, “This is what 70 looks like.”sixtyandme This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

She had a string of romances with beautiful, troubled men. Further boxes are ticked on the biopic checklist by the fact that she struggled with demons – heroin was her drug of choice.But Nico, 1988, the daringly unconventional biopic by Italian director Susanna Nicchiarelli, which has just opened in the US, is not about the singer in her iconic phase. Instead it deals with the last two years of her life: Nico prefers to go by her birth name, Christa Päffgen she performs avant-garde proto-goth dirges while scowling through her fringe in European e bars the decades of addiction have taken their toll, but she doesn’t care: “I wasn’t happy when I was beautiful.”Nico’s value to Warhol was inextricably linked to the way she looked. When asked what became of Nico after she left his studio, the Factory, Warhol was dismissive: “She became a fat junkie and disappeared.” But what interested Nicchiarelli was her resilience. Unlike other Warhol superstars – such as Edie Sedgwick and Candy Darling – who crashed and burned once their 15 minutes of fame were snatched away, Nico reclaimed herself. Talking at the Rotterdam film festival, Nicchiarelli said, “The intriguing thing about Nico was that she survived. She was so much stronger.”The focus of this film – on unglamorous middle age rather than gilded youth – is significant. It is representative of a change in the way biopics – for so long dominated by white, male stories – approach female subjects. There’s no doubt that we are in the midst of a particularly rich period for female-led real-life dramas. Alongside independent productions such as Nico, 1988 and Christine (about TV news anchor Christine Chubbuck), Hollywood has also got in on the act. The last 18 months have seen the release of studio productions such as I, Tonya, Battle of the Sexes, Molly’s Game, Queen of Katwe and Hidden Figures.It’s tempting to assume that this wealth of female-led biopics represents a surge in the number of films about women that have been produced. A look forward to the coming award season certainly seems to back that up. Forthcoming female biopics include those of two writers, two queens, a spy, a wrestler and a US Supreme Court Justice.But statistics tell a different story. Just last week, the University of South California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which analyses the representation of women, along with people of colour, LGBT characters and characters with disability in cinema, released a study entitled Inequality in 1,100 Popular Films, which covers the top 100 movies each year from 2007 through to 2017 and shows no significant statistical improvement in the representation of women. Study co-author Katherine Pieper attributes the impression that there are more female-led films than there actually are to “the availability heuristic”. This, she says, is “the tendency of people to overestimate the occurrence of a particular item because of examples that easily come to mind”.But there is something else at play. What is harder to define, but does seem like a genuinely positive trend, is a shift in the narratives of female-led biopics, a change in the kind of stories that get told. Previously, the main criterion for biopic treatment seemed to be a set of male genitalia, and failing that, royal blood or a singing career. The Hollywood approach suggested that women’s stories were more valuable if youth and beauty were key plot points. And for some reason, doomed and tragic tended to be an easier sell to financiers than difficult and complex.Now, bad behaviour is not just permitted, it’s positively encouraged. Last year saw Molly’s Game showcase poker queen and FBI target Molly Bloom, while I, Tonya got under the sequined Lycra of disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding. Flawed female characters continue to exert a fascination. This autumn will see Can You Ever Forgive Me?, starring Melissa McCarthy, which tells of American author turned literary forger and thief Lee\u0026nbspIsrael. And Red Joan, starring Judi Dench, is inspired by the life of the KGB’s longest-serving British spy, Melita Norwood.Female biopics are not shying away from racial and sexual politics. Hidden Figures, which explored the role of a team of female African American mathematicians in the Nasa space programme, was hugely\u0026nbspsuccessful. And Mimi Leder’s On The Basis Of Sex, about Ruth Bader Ginsburg, her struggles for equal rights and her journey to become a US supreme court justice, is already tipped for the awards circuit this year.Although suspicious of the subjective nature of biopics and their often stodgy approach, Mia Bays, director-at-large of Birds’ Eye View, which campaigns for gender equality in film, concurs. “It seems the net has been cast a little wider of late and the biopic is no longer the preserve of the damaged musician and royalty,” she says. “The 1970s appears to be a recurring period in terms of female-led biopics, and may say more about the times we are living in now – as the fourth wave of feminism surges, we look back to an earlier age for answers.”While cinema is notoriously slow to react to social movements, it’s hard not to view the new wave of female-led biopics through the lens of the post-#MeToo era. There is a fresh awareness not only of the treatment of women within the film industry but also of the telling of their stories. The term “inclusion rider” (a contract term requiring ersity in cast and crew) has\u0026nbspentered industry consciousness, and lobbying groups such as Era 5050 and Women and Hollywood are calling for equal representation for women in front of and behind the camera.While we are yet to see what effect this all has on the films that get made, it has certainly had an effect on the audience reaction to them. Bays says: “We need to keep up the pressure to tell more women’s stories as there’s a hunger out there for them – we hear and see it every day in our work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f2c10d34c395445f633946624ac476a04158eb2/0_29_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=769f88292512402ebfc3919208ed9417","title":"chelsea manchester city community shield match report","story":"Given that this is the shortest break between the World Cup final and English football’s traditional curtain raiser since 1966 – only three weeks – it should have felt unfeasibly early to be remotely ready for the resumption of domestic tussles. The extent that it did depended entirely on the shade of blue. Manchester City, defending champions, kicked off and immediately began passing the ball around in the August heatwave with cool precision and dominant intent.The slickness in City’s movement, the crispness of their passing, the all-round authority, was ominously impressive for any of the teams hoping to make up ground on a group that reached a century of points last season. A week to go until they resume Premier League hostilities with an away match at Arsenal, they show no obvious signs of a hangover or a drift taking hold, and harbour few concerns about imperfect summer preparations with so many players having been involved at the World Cup. In fact, they flexed their strength in depth in that they were able to pick up the tempo, regain that familiar sense of control, with a handful of important players not involved at all. Kevin De Bruyne, for example, was back in the fold but only in shape for a watching brief going fuchsia as he sat in the boiling sun alongside the subs.City are seeking to become the first Premier League team to retain the title for a decade and they mean business. The manager has abundant experience of serial-winning at Barcelona and Bayern Munich and hunger is, Guardiola insists, the key to it all. How much do you want it, training session after training session, day after day, season after season? There was a hint of an answer in the 39th minute, when the ball went out of play in innocuous circumstances near the halfway line and in an instant the majority of City’s players, and manager, were vehemently appealing for the decision to go their way. The arms shot up. The eyes bore in on the officials. Leading 1-0 in a showpiece friendly, not exactly the most dangerous of situations on the pitch, they were fired up about details.At the end of it all, with a comfortable 2-0 win courtesy of goals from Sergio Agüero, City’s players climbed the Wembley steps to collect the shield from a cheerful Mike Summerbee. Down on the pitch Guardiola and his staff watched on with an air of genuine delight. In the spirit that winning breeds winning, the vibes were about not just continuing, but pushing on, from last season’s record-breaking season. You get the impression anyone minded to take their foot off the pedal will not be tolerated, by manager or teammates.Psyched for the new campaign? Chelsea looked a few beats behind as City crafted five attempts on goal in the opening quarter of an hour, and that included an opening goal. It was made by the accomplished Phil Foden, the golden boy who is pushing hard for a more regular role. He glided through from central midfield and dinked the ball to Agüero, whose neat control allowed him to slide an angled shot through Antonio Rüdiger’s legs and into the far corner of the net.By then, Riyad Mahrez and Leroy Sané had already taken shots. Bernardo Silva had jinked into a promising position and prised open Chelsea’s defence with ease. Agüero had dragged an opportunity wide. Guardiola stared on intensely from his technical area, looking as driven as ever. Over on the Chelsea bench Maurizio Sarri looked desperate for a cigarette.This was not an easy platform for Sarri to wave a magic wand. They certainly seemed to miss the presence of their best missing players more than City did. The N’Golo Kanté-shaped hole in their midfield was sizeable, and made it difficult for them to perform with much coherence. Jorginho, who plumped for Chelsea instead of City, knows he has a different kind of job on his hands slotting in to one team rather than the other. Eden Hazard was an obvious miss in terms of cutting edge.Chelsea’s most promising feature was that Claudio Bravo kept goal for City in a particularly bewildered style. Three times in the first half he fluffed when the ball was in his vicinity. First he clawed recklessly at Cesc Fàbregas’s lofted free-kick. He was less assured the next time he was tested as Callum Hudson-Odoi’s crack took him by surprise and bounced off him awkwardly. Then, he froze completely when Marcos Alonso’s arcing shot looped over his head.Agüero threatened to inflict more damage after the break. He brushed the side netting when Foden, again, was on hand with an inventive assist. Then Agüero returned the favour to tee up the youngster whose shot was underpowered. City’s second came with another of those thrusting breaks from back to front, as they picked up possession and ran with it. Bernardo’s pass for Agüero was perfect and the Argentinian finished instinctively.The scoreline could have been more emphatic. The substitute Brahim Díaz enjoyed some positive moments, and Gabriel Jesus and Bernardo had good opportunities to add gloss to an already comprehensive win.Chelsea searched for a glimmer of comfort and came close to a consolation late on as Ross Barkley broke down the right and crossed for Tammy Abraham. Bravo managed to do enough to scramble the ball away. Overall, the Sarri effect was not instantly tangible for Chelsea but no new manager trying to get some new ideas across while getting to know a new squad in a new environment would appreciate being judged against this City side in this mood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/940ab4cc40c8e148a2ba2a03fa486994ba16dd42/693_132_3162_1898/master/3162.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3e71f6bee2d3bbda372cd45c255fad3","title":"chelsea v manchester city community shield live","story":"Two goals from Sergio Agüero gave an impressive Manchester City a comfortable win over Chelsea who, on other day would have been beaten by several moreSo that’s about us - thanks for your company. Bye! It’s been a while since a team retained the Premier League - the last was Manchester United 2007-2009. And they started brilliantly in 1997-98 only to fall away, likewise Arsenal in 2002-03 - but they were bested by sides far better than than those seeking to outstrip City. The thing with City is that the way they play and the firepower they have, it’s very hard to see them dropping many points against the less good teams, even if - and it’s a big if - the better ones can beat them one-on-one. Hey Jude is playing and the City team are singing along as the trophy goes down the line. Ilkay Gundogan is sporting an extremely severe haircut. Mike Summerbee is very happy, and will present the trophy to Fernandinho, captain for the day ... er, and Vincent Kompany, club captain. I wonder where Guardiola will use Foden - will he be a midfielder or a wide player? And when, if at all, he’ll bin someone proper from his starting XI to accommodate him. Chelsea have already been up, and now here come City to collect the Shield. Oh, and they’re also really happy. Mahrez looks especially happy, and Aguero receives the man of the match champagne from the McDonald’s mum of the year. It’s extremely moving, I can tell you. Riyad Mahrez thinks it was a good win. Sergio Aguero thinks the most important thing was to win the trophy. They really do. He says City will take it game by game and if they play in the same way as today they’ll see where they get to. He also says Foden was ready for the Premier League last season, so is even, er, readier now and it’s good to have a player with such talent, all the more so a homegrown one. Pep Guardiola is happy his team did so well given how little prep City have had, and how hot it was. That was as easy as could be for City, who played with their usual enterprise and speed Foden and Mendy were particular pluses. Chelsea, who just couldn’t live with them, have a lot of work to do - and even then.90+4 min Gomez, who has impressed Guardiola a lot this pre-season, replaces Stones.90+4 min City have had chances to win this by six, and there’s another, the ball going out to the right then back over to the left, where Diaz megs Azpilicueta in passing to Jesus. He’s in front of Caballero, back to goal, and when he can’t turn on it it goes back to Bernardo, whose shot is poked away by Rudiger. 90+3 min Willian robs Otamendi, who immediately robs him back. City break and within seconds, Walker has put the lively Diaz in. But Caballero, who’s been decent, it out sharply, stands up well, and blocks the shot with his body. 90+2 min Sergio Ageuro is announced a man of the match can’t argue with that. 90+1 min Chelsea want to go home. They’re tired and they want to go to bed. They consumed an alcoholic beverage 60 minutes ago and it’s penetrated the cerebellum. Wherever they may perambulate, on land or sea or atmospheric vapour, you will always hear them chanting this melody, indicate the route to their habitual abode. 90 min There shall be four additional minutes. 88 min One pass sets Barkley away down the right, and his low cross is decent, seeking Abraham. Bravo, though, is out well, smothering the shot, and the spin on the Rick O’Shea means that Moses can’t simply prod home. Chelsea have to content themselves with a corner, which of course comes to nothing.87 min Laporte has hurt himself, so Otamendi comes on. 86 min Chelsea fans are streaming to the exits. The lure of the Tube queue is a difficult one to resist. 84 min Here come City yet again, this time with Diaz and Jesus, who rinses Luiz and should pass, but instead unloads a shot that Caballero beats away. This second half in particular hass been a chastening one for Chelsea.83 min Sarri is making a lot of notes. I wonder if “must play better” is one of them. 82 min Unai Emery is in the crowd City play Arsenal next week. Good luck with that one. In the meantime, the lively Diaz runs at the Chelsea defence and tries another low shot, which Caballero shoves away.81 min City knock it about with apparent effortlessness. 80 min A change apiece: Moses for Pedro, and Kompany for Aguero. As such, Stones is now playing in midfield. 79 min Still all City, Mendy again burrowing forward and finding Aguero, who opens his body and slides right for Diaz. He does really well to trick past Alonso on the outside, but with men in the box, opts to fire high into the side-netting. 76 min “I agree with you in that City have by far superior players in certain positions right now, but this Chelsea squad is still finding a way,” reckons Trishanu Borah. “Two weeks into Sarri’s new system, while City has been under Pep for what, 2 years now? The midfield indeed looks far from impressive, but we are missing 2 players called N’golo and Kante. As for the attack, Hazard and Willian will soon be slotting in!My only concern is the club not willing to spend on a properleft-back, (though Emerson can come good I guess), Alonso, as great as he is on the goalscoring front, has much lacking to be a left-back in an attacking system depending on a high line.”Sure - Chelsea will be better with Kante and Hazard - I’m just saying that 4-3-3 doesn’t strike me as the best way to get the best out of this squad, and if Sarri isn’t getting money to spend, maybe he should prioritise his players over his principles. 75 min Foden, who’s been good, is replaced by Diaz. 74 min “Aguero is underlining what the Argentine national team should have done in the World Cup,” emails Rick McGahey, “have him attacking in the box to free up space for Messi drifting in behind into the open spaces created. Aguero’s aggressive forward play, constantly moving and challenging the back line is a great strength for any team and it is mysterious why Argentina didn’t use him more.”They didn’t seem to have any plan - not even how best to use Messi - just a lot of good attackers to chuck at things and hope. 72 min In comes the free-kick, and though there are far more defenders than attackers in the box, City still find an overload at the back post and Luiz has to head behind. The corner goes to Gundogan on the edge, and he curves a first-time pass over the top ... and again, Aguero is in aeons, hooking a hard volley that Caballero has to beat away. 71 min Jesus nips the ball around Rudiger out on the left and is duly fouled. Worse than it looked, reckons McManaman, “to be very honest”. Because plain old honesty just won’t do. 69 min Chelsea resolve their lack of striking presence by introducing Abraham ... in place of Morata. I don’t know it looks like Sarri is prioritising theory over reality, because two men up would at least give City something about which to think. 67 min Chelsea cannot play a line this high without pressure on the ball, and they get away with another one when Rudiger steps up as Aguero darts in behind. he flag goes up, but I’m not so sure. 66 min So here come City again, Mendy prominent down the left and Mahrez cracking a low shot just wide. 66 min But Morata is involved as Chelsea get the ball out to Pedro, who comes inside on his left foot and fades a soft shot just wide.64 min City look far more likely to score again than Chelsea do to sneak a livener. Morata really needs some help to play up front on your bill, you’ve got to be special, and the best at it tend to have an imposing personality. He does not.62 min “The idea that Chelsea ‘don’t have the players’ seems to be a very modern mindset, and not one I particularly like”, emails Souradeep Sengupta. The old-fashioned approach, which Sarri himself agrees with, is to improve players on the training ground. Sure, Drinkwater will never be Pirlo, but if he can help Hudson-Odoi and Barkley, both of whom have looked promising in this match, to reach their potential, Sarriball could be a reality. It’s not that strange a philosophy, verticality and a high line.”Chelsea aren’t as good as City, and the reason Conte put them in that 3-4-2-1 was because it best suited the players he had - in particular, Luiz and Hazard. Sarri can coach players, it’s true, but into better versions of themselves, not different iterations entirely. 60 min Pedro catches his knee on Laporte, but seems to be fine immediately afterwards. 60 min Before we kick-off again, two changes for Chelsea: Hudson-Odoi and Fabregas off, Willian and Drinkwater on. This is ominous for the rest. Stones intercepts, Gudogan carries on through midfield, and finds Bernardo, who slides a reverse-ball into the box for Aguero. This time there’s no messing and he snaps his usual finish under Caballero. 57 min Decent long pass from Luiz, putting Hudson-Odoi in a race with Walker, but the bounce helps the defender and allows him to intervene.56 min City are so purposeful in their passing, always looking to go forward and to where their opponent is weakest. Chelsea, on the other hand, are sluggish, though chasing the ball in the heat is not best preparation for whatever it is they’re trying to achieve.53 min After an outstanding year as a hypeman, Mendy is enjoying himself on the pitch. He’ll make City a lot better, though if Fernandinho gets injured for any length of time, they’ll have a problem. But here comes Azpilicueta, finding space outside him and hitting a cross on the run which forces a corner. It comes to nothing and City quickly counter, but make nothing of it.

He drilled us for six weeks of hard work and everyone’s struggling at the end of the game which shows it’s been hard work.” Liam Cooper, the captain, adds a thudding dose of perspective: “We’ve done nothing. We started well last year, so we will learn our lessons from that.” Cooper and Roofe are congratulated off the pitch by Andrea Radrizzani, the beaming Leeds owner lurking in the tunnel.A dream start to life under Marcelo Bielsa but also a brilliant performance, brimming with intensity and vigour. Leeds were superb, Stoke pretty dire.90+3 min: Hernandez plays a stinging cross into the box but it’s too quick for Harrison, the substitute, who cannot make any contact to glance home. 90+2 min: Berardi concedes a corner and the ball drops to Allen’s feet a couple of yards out ... but Peacoack-Farrell makes an instinctive save to keep it out. Leeds zoom up the other end through Dallas but, once the attack breaks down, they recycle possession. 90 min: There will be five added minutes.88 min: Leeds thump the ball downfield and it’s surely job done now, as Alioski’s replaced by Jack Harrison. Bielsa does not made an ounce of eye contact with either Alioski or Saiz as they leave the field, instead letting his myriad of assistants embrace them.86 min: Alioski is down with what presumably is cramp after an afternoon at full-tilt. Moritz Bauer, the Stoke defender, lends a helping hand. Saiz is also grounded after a tough challenge but he’s coming off anyway, with Lewis Baker on for his Leeds debut. 85 min: McClean does well, battling his way down the left flank, jumping over challenges from Phillips and a cruncher from Berardi. But he doesn’t really have anything to show for it, and Leeds usher the ball out for a goal-kick. Stoke might feel shortchanged but Leeds have not given them a sniff, barring that penalty.84 min: Chance for Stoke! Crouch peels off his marker to reach a deep cross, and he heads back across goal to force Peacock-Farrell into clambering to his right to get fingertips on it, with Allen ready to pounce. 82 min: Allen looks exasperated after failing to eke a corner out of a ruthless Leeds operation. Penalty aside, Stoke have been totally stumped here. 80 min: Kalvin Phillips flies in on Darren Fletcher on halfway and he looks a little sheepish as the referee has a word with him. The Leeds midfielder gets off lightly.77 min: ... no, McClean takes it and Peacock-Farrell, though not too convincingly, pushes to safety. The ball cannons back in towards Crouch, who rises above the Leeds goalkeeper to cause some panic. It drops to Martins Indi but his header lands on the roof of Peacock-Farrell’s goal. On target, that might have been 3-2.76 min: Stoke win a free-kick, 25 yards from goal. Bojan likes the look of it. Can he conjure up some magic?74 min: And that’s Afobe’s last contribution, with Peter Crouch coming on. They are hardly like-for-like but, given half a chance, Crouch will be a threat. Leeds also tweak personnel, with Klich off for Dallas.73 min: Cooper and Afobe collide as they both fight for the same ball. The striker comes off worse but is soon up on his feet. Meanwhile, Ayling’s down for Leeds.71 min: Martins Indi sells Butland short with a simple back pass with Saiz lurking but the Stoke goalkeeper gets there to tidy up. Another scare for Stoke. Stuart Dallas is being readied down on the touchline. 70 min: Roofe stands up a clever cross for Alioski in the middle but Butland comes out to claim it. Down on the Leeds bench, there’s a bit of activity ...68 min: “Mar-ce-lo Bielsa, Mar-ce-lo Bielsa!” loudly and proudly sing a section of sunbathed Leeds fans. 67 min: Roofe’s movement is proving a real problem for Stoke, who look statuesque in defence. Leeds’s tails are up once more and they’re trying all sorts of flicks and passes Alioski curls a beautiful ball into the box, Hernandez unselfishly lays the ball off but Klich, who scored the opener, drives over. Lovely stuff.64 min: McClean wins Stoke a corner which comes to nothing, with Bojan caught cold in possession and the ball runs all the way back to Butland who has to start over. Leeds get bodies behind the ball and, eventually, Cooper clears the ball with Afobe lurking. 63 min: Bojan and Darren Fletcher are on for Stoke, with Etebo and N’Diaye off. Both had endured pretty difficult afternoons, given the runaround by a Leeds midfield led by Klich and Hernandez. 61 min: McClean is livid after Ayling nips in to steal the ball away down the left. The pass from Etebo was a little light in fairness and McClean’s not a happy bunny. Rowett readies a couple of substitutes ...60 min: That Cooper header has left Stoke shellshocked, while it has re-energised Leeds, with Bielsa barking instructions from the touchline. Cue a rousing rendition of Marching on Together. 58 min: A league-high fourteen assists for Douglas last season and he’s off the mark already for his new club.Douglas whips in a lovely, flat in-swinger, with captain Liam Cooper there to nod in at the front post. Simple, and Leeds have restored their two-goal lead.56 min: Douglas fizzes in a lovely ball for Ayling, arriving late at the back stick but McClean gets there to clear for a corner ...54 min: Ince overhits a lofted ball downfield in search of Afobe, who has the courtesy to give his new team-mate a thumbs-up. At last, a bit of intent from Stoke, while Leeds’s movement continues to cause problems.Peacock-Farrell es to his right and Afobe rolls it down the middle. Suddenly, it’s game on. That was pretty poor from a Leeds perspective, with some comical defending by Berardi and then a naive tug by Douglas on Ince giving the referee no choice but to hand Stoke a way back in. Can Leeds go again?52 min: Stoke win a penalty! Berardi twice fails to clear before Douglas drags down Ince. Afobe will take ...50 min: McClean comes deep in search of the ball, knocking it back to Shawcross who is forced into playing it all the way back to Butland. Ah. Leeds, pressing like no tomorrow, are absolutely loving this. 49 min: Roofe is played in over the top and his pace frightens Martins Indi into backing off. Roofe scurries towards the byline before crossing – but no one in white is there to meet it. Hernandez then scoops in a decent free-kick but Berardi cannot get there.47 min: Peacock-Farrell lumps a goal-kick downfield but Stoke clear their lines. The second half has began a little like a basketball match, the ball toing and froing. 46 min: Leeds get things under way before Stoke probe forward. Allen is yet to find his range, with Klich this time sliding in to cut out another searching pass. Stoke badly need to find some kind of rhythm.Gary Rowett has sent his Stoke City side out nice and early for the second half. It can’t get any worse, can it?Down at Wembley, Manchester City are partying away after clinching the Community Shield:So far, so very good for Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds. Stoke have been nothing short of abysmal, abject in all senses but credit to Leeds who have harried them into the ground. Roofe has been particularly bright. As for Stoke, their midfield has been totally bypassed time and again, while an isolated Benik Afobe’s offered nothing.It gets worse for Stoke. Pablo Hernandez runs on to a neat little pass on the edge of the box and his speculative effort breezes through the fingertips of Jack Butland, who really should do better. Leeds deserve it but a truly dreadful moment for Butland. Where do Stoke go from here? Leeds have been relentless. 41 min: Another near miss for Leeds, this time with Roofe twisting and turning on the right flank, eventually crossing for Alioski who beats Bauer in the challenge to head wide. For an experienced back five, Stoke have been all over the place defensively. 40 min: And now Roofe drills inches wide, after sliderule through ball by Alioski. Leeds have been fantastic, pulling Stoke’s defenders from pillar to post. Bielsa, perched on the drinks cooler, seems to be enjoying things anyway. 38 min: Alioski bullies Bauer into winning a Leeds throw deep inside the Stoke half. And when the ball falls to Hernandez on the edge of the box, he dinks a gorgeous ball with the outside of his boot in for Alioski, who volleys at Butland. In the end, it was pretty simple for the Stoke goalkeeper but that would have been stunning. 35 min: Joe Allen’s touch is poor and Roofe steals the ball away. As Stoke seek to win it back, Erik Pieters goes in high on Saiz, gifting Leeds a free-kick on halfway.34 min: Pieters looks to slide in McClean but he delays the pass, it’s too slow and Ayling nips in. Stoke have not been given a sniff, other than that McClean-Afobe break a moment ago, though that was entirely of Leeds’s doing. Other than Berardi’s error, it’s all been very comfortable. 33 min: Shawcross pumps the ball long in search of Afobe but the ball fails to stick. So, back come Leeds, knocking it around nicely, much to the delight of the home supporters, who can barely believe what they are watching. They’ve totally dominated ...31 min: Leeds continue to control proceedings, with Klich beavering away at Joe Allen.

His home, in south London, is an old builder’s yard, sandwiched between a busy railway line and the backs of Victorian terraces. Except that it’s also a bit of a rustic hideaway, too. A sliver of track-side meadow lies opposite and the unmade path that leads to his front door is dotted with wild flowers and waist-high grasses. “Nobody can find this place – even our post often goes to a house in the next street,” says Burgess.The building was derelict when Burgess and his wife, landscape architect Andrea Dates, bought it. “It was in a terrible state – stacked with rotten timbers and piles of old pipes,” he says. Cement had been poured over what has been made into their back garden. They had the cement broken up and removed, chunk by huge chunk, and then they sifted through years of detritus beneath. Some of the prettier spoils – cloudy glass bottles, sections of slate and the odd rusted cog – are now displayed around their home.Larger-scale reminders of the building’s previous life remain, too, from municipal door handles to windows with safety glass crisscrossed with wire. The brick wall above the cooker is made from pitted and crumbled London bricks, while other sections of the building are shored up with more prosaic breeze block, patched up with whatever was to hand at the time. The couple’s bathroom was once the builder’s office, with a small hatch where workmen collected their wages. “We filled in the opening and it’s now a useful set of shelves,” says Burgess.Other jobs included fixing sheets of ply to the pitched ceiling and adding some internal windows, using corrugated polycarbonate. “It’s lightweight, insulates well and is easy to cut,” explains Burgess, who also made all the wooden shelves and the kitchen units, incorporating a pair of decorative 1940s drawers into his kitchen build.But all of the couple’s alterations were born of necessity, rather than in pursuit of any “reclaimed” aesthetic. “Originality was forced upon us because of our limited budget,” says Burgess. “But it was never our intention to turn this space into a pristine white cube.” Colour is a big part of the couple’s style, with vibrant paint shades inspired by travels to India and Latin America – Andrea is Argentinian so they frequently visit her family there and have travelled around the region.Urban life is a mainstay of Burgess’s art work, from anonymous London flats painted from estate agents’ listings to children playing in the fountains of Granary Square in King’s Cross. Then there are paintings of markets, depicting fruit and veg sellers in Dalston and a stall piled high with flip-flops, in Pune, India. “Markets are part of why cities exist,” he says. “It’s how they developed as trading centres and, in most cities, markets are still a hub of city life.”The vibrant yellow of the rubber floor was inspired by a trip to Mexico City: “It was dusty grey concrete before, so we were thrilled with the effect,” he says. More colour comes from a pair of old chairs that Andrea re-covered in pink velvet. She also painted subtle gilt trims on a headboard in the bedroom. “The 1930s bed was passed on by my nana, along with its original mattress filled with straw. Andrea sanded it back and picked out the carving in gold paint – and, yes, we updated the mattress.”The bedroom’s brick walls are painted in a luminous shade of turquoise, which took a couple of goes to get right. “It’s a room that doesn’t get much natural light so it needed to be a strong colour,” says Burgess. At the foot of their bed, he created an internal window, using corrugated polycarbonate. The reverse side of the window is stacked with rows of old glassware, so light still flows in. When trains rumble by, the glasses shiver and tinkle, a reminder of the urban setting.Burgess’s own colour-saturated paintings hang all around this single-storey home, alongside old family photos and two works by artist John Kiki, who inspired and helped Burgess when he was starting out. “I was a trainee at a Norwich gallery and one of my first jobs was to pick up John’s paintings from his studio, hidden away above a meat-packing warehouse. I was just stunned by his work,” he remembers.Burgess soon went on to help set up a co-operative studio in Norwich, where he and other artists renovated a disused warehouse – skills that were useful when he and Andrea converted this London space many years later. “Whether it’s to make a studio or a home, most artists need to be adept at reusing spaces in creative ways,” he says.Trevor Burgess’s work can be seen at In The City, East Gallery (nua.ac.uk) until 1 September he sells his paintings via Cavaliero Finn (cavalierofinn)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/604ad61332ee65d3e71133edb0c19babc8d1b298/0_73_1732_1039/master/1732.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f60de76ef032bd89e591f3b5996cc427","title":"the plays the thing five fabulous audio dramas not to miss this summer","story":"With audio content exploding in popularity, a raft of gripping stories told by multiple narrators is just a few clicks awayA conversation can speak volumes and in the world of audio dramas, they often do. The audio drama – a piece of fiction told using several voices – is in the midst of a renaissance. Previously consigned to rare radio slots on rainy Sundays, audio dramas are now ubiquitous, buoyed by audience tastes for podcasts, and attracting some of the world’s most exciting writers and actors.These are professional, high-quality productions – think Netflix for your ears. And like Netflix, Audible has begun commissioning original audio dramas, making them free for members, putting an end to the bottleneck in which many creatives vie for one radio slot (and a broadcaster therefore has to pick the one with broadest appeal). Audio dramas run the gamut, whether you want a tear-jerking tragedy, an edge-of-your-seat thriller, or a heart-fluttering romance. With such variety, they make for perfect accompaniments to your summer holidays, whether you’ve got a long-haul backpacking trip planned, or a short and swift city break lined up.But with so many options, where do you begin?We picked out five of the best audio dramas from Audible, so you don’t have to. All you have to worry about is whether or not you can resist binge-listening your weekend away.The Child “My name is Simon. I’m 10 years old. I’m a serial killer.” So begins Sebastian Fitzek’s chilling tale of a boy who claims to have killed in a previous life. Set in Berlin, the story follows the child and the only people who believe his cryptic utterings – his mother and a lawyer she has hired. But when Simon’s knowledge leads to several bodies being discovered, the police start to suspect the lawyer. He must solve the crimes before the police put him in the frame, no matter what it takes. Fitzek is one of Germany’s most lauded crime-thriller writers and has seen his work translated into 20 languages. His talents are at their height in this intricate, spine-tingling adaptation. The fabulous narrators include Emilia Fox (Polanski’s The Pianist) and Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks).Northanger Abbey If audio dramas are having a renaissance, Northanger Abbey might be the Sistine Chapel. A slick, star-studded adaptation of Jane Austen’s classic, this ambitious production has redefined audio storytelling – which is to be expected, given the cast. National treasure and Bafta award-winning actress Emma Thompson tops the bill, bringing Austen’s dry wit to life, while supporting performances from Lily Cole and Jeremy Irvine elevate the series to GOAT (greatest of all time) level. This coming-of-age story follows 17-year-old Catherine Morland through love, danger and intrigue, satirising the gothic tales that were popular at the time of writing, while taking a shrewd look at the British class system. Such skewering of high society feels as fresh as ever. Even those put off by historical drama will find joy in this.Neverwhere Nobody anticipated the impact the BBC’s 2013 adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s cult novel by the same name would have. Broadcast over six days, the production was a smash hit with Gaiman fans and non-fans alike, propelling the audio play into the public eye and showing just how exciting the form can be. Download to listen to Benedict Cumberbatch, David Harewood, James McAvoy and Natalie Dormer telling the story of Richard Mayhew, the unassuming Londoner who finds himself in London Below, a magical version of – and coexisting with – the real city, known as London Above. Originally conceived as a television series, Neverwhere lends itself to episodes, and so its separation into six parts feels natural and seamless. And on Audible it includes over 25 minutes of additional unbroadcasted material, including extended scenes, bloopers and outtakes.Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book: The Mowgli Stories One for the slightly older kids (and also the parents), The Mowgli Stories brings together all of Kipling’s tales about the boy raised by animals in the jungle. Though the average listener might think they know all there is to know about Mowgli from the much-loved Disney film, his adventure takes many more twists and turns. This retelling of the timeless classic stays true to Kipling’s darker side and the well-known cast, including comedian Bill Bailey and actors Richard E Grant and Celia Imrie, make this one unforgettable audio drama. A must-listen for anyone who has seen the film, and a brilliant, truthful, introduction to the work of Kipling for those who haven’t.Locke \u0026amp Key One of Audible’s first forays into commissioning original audio dramas is still among the most ambitious undertakings the form has seen. Locke \u0026amp Key began life as a graphic novel – so translating the form from highly visual to solely audio was no small feat. To do so, Audible drafted in Locke \u0026amp Key’s creators, Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez, to ensure the adaptation stayed true to its dark, terrifying roots. And it worked, assisted no doubt by the voice of scream queen Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) and Haley Joel Osment of “I see dead people” fame. Locke \u0026amp Key follows a family who, starting over after a tragedy, set themselves up in a quiet town that is also frequented by demons. A sharp production that will have you jumping out of your skin and sleeping with one eye open.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible - £7.99 a month after 30 days.

The early evening sky in Preston Park was rose gold as Britney Spears laughed, swished her ponytail and lip-synced the opening line of her dark dance banger Gimme More, which a few glitter-decked revellers wore emblazoned on T-shirts today: “It’s Britney, bitch.”It has recently become a trend for fans to shout that question at Spears, as she takes her $138m-grossing, career-stabilising Las Vegas show on the road. It’s a fun in-joke, a meme that both artist and fanbase are in on. But perhaps most importantly, it raises a smile from a performer whose live performances in the past decade have often seemed detached, if you’re being kind, or dead-eyed, if you’re not.Spears’ shaky live reputation doesn’t seem to matter to the mainly LGBT crowd in Brighton. The park today feels like gay Comic-Con: a drag queen struts in a stitch-perfect “Toxic” flight attendant outfit, complete with jaunty pillbox hat, and one group dresses as Spears incarnations from schoolgirl to majorette. The air seems to fizz with electricity, and when she does appear, in a cloud of dry ice and a promptly discarded top hat, a roar erupts that feels like a Boeing 747 taking off.She keeps audience banter to a minimum. Instead, she constantly moves, writhing, pointing, skipping across stage, and dramatically throwing her body to the ground. It’s a trade-off that makes her seem a little distanced, and you’re left to wonder if it’s worth it. Spears doesn’t always keep pace with her dancers, which is particularly noticeable in the complex Me Against the Music choreography, but she seems committed to keeping the BPMs high and the routines gymnastic. It’s a shame: you could imagine rousing singalongs to classic ballads such as Everytime and Lucky.When Spears plays the hits, or even the sort-of hits, the reaction is galvanic. It feels as if a riot is about to break out during her 26-song set’s opening one-two punch of Work Bitch and Womanizer, and for Toxic – one of the 00s’ oddest, most brilliant pop smashes – there is an acre-wide whoop as Spears is flung through the air by dancers. It’s fitting that the show is almost spiritually camp, from the ringmaster jackets of Circus to the hunks in harnesses during Slave 4 U, who would fit in perfectly at the park’s sweaty Brüt men’s dance tent. A 2003 deep cut, Breathe on Me, raises a rapturous cheer for its spoken-word portion during which Spears huskily intones: “Just put your lips together and blow.” Despite the adoring crowd, Spears sometimes seems on edge, adjusting her ponytail and smiling tightly at the end of songs as if to ask: “Was that OK?” When she loosens up, it’s infectious. Do You Wanna Come Over, a skippable track from Spears’ 2016 Glory album, becomes an unexpected highlight with dancers clad in neon sportswear, while the final song, Till the World Ends, during which confetti rains and Spears brandishes a rainbow flag, feels like the closing party Pride needs. Spears titled the show Piece of Me after her 2007 song that flips media narratives about her as “Miss bad media karma” and coolly wields them like a mace. Her performance at Pride doesn’t have that song’s bite, but is propelled by Spears’ undeniable hits into a glitzy, crowd-pleasing spectacle. At its heart, Spears is an uncertain presence, but she seems happy to still be at the party."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/109c3b0c01c850fc2475d1f7c26740f5784d0653/427_183_692_415/master/692.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79f5fa76af461e885e716411fdbe3b2a","title":"national youth orchestra george benjamin review symphony hall birmingham","story":"Symphony Hall, BirminghamAt times the sheer number of musicians was overwhelming but their playing was brilliantly vivid and fabulously poisedThe National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain has a tradition of inviting composers to work with its annual crop of outstandingly talented young musicians that goes back at least to the early 70s, when Pierre Boulez had several memorable encounters. But it seems an even more regular part of the orchestra’s activities now. A year ago Thomas Adès conducted a programme of Francisco Coll, Stravinsky and his own Polaris this time it was George Benjamin, who included his 2004 score Dances Figures alongside Mussorgsky, Ravel, Ligeti and Debussy.Benjamin’s choice of works harked back to his own precocious youth, too – he had told the orchestra that as a child he’d first encountered Mussorgsky’s Night on Bare Mountain in the Stokowski-ised version used in Walt Disney’s Fantasia. Here it was the Rimsky-Korsakov arrangement of the score that began the concert, though for once the huge forces of NYOGB – an orchestra with septuple woodwind, 10 horns and three tubas – weren’t necessarily an advantage, when a leaner, meaner sound might have given this evocation of a witches’ sabbath a bit more intensity and edge.There were a few other moments when the sheer weight of tone seemed almost overbearing in Symphony Hall, but elsewhere Benjamin clearly relished the extra sonic dimension such huge forces allowed him – being able to realise the isi cello effects in Debussy’s La Mer with two players to each part, for instance use five piccolos to bring extra definition to some of the lines in his brilliantly vivid performance of Dance Figures or give such glowing depth to the textures in Ligeti’s Lontano.In those pieces, and in Ravel’s Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, there was some fabulously poised solo playing from the NYOGB woodwind principals, and inner details in the concerto that you rarely hear in performance. Tamara Stefanovich was the attentive, surprisingly contained soloist, adding a touching tribute to Oliver Knussen, who died last month, as an encore. His Prayer Bell Sketch, sounding like a Debussy prelude reworked by Scriabin, fitted the context of this concert perfectly. • The repeat of this concert at the Proms is available on BBC iPlayer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c18df3d3b90ab2167977d3c5e47c70466c20c594/0_0_4256_2815/master/4256.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fe0b09f9d8397ef82b9f8a4e62ddd5d3 1320w","title":"adam peaty world record doubt timing fault european championships","story":"The validity of Adam Peaty’s latest world record in the 100 metres breaststroke has been cast into doubt after a fault was discovered in the timing system at the European Swimming Championships in Glasgow.The Olympic champion was thought to have lowered his own mark to exactly 57.00sec in taking gold at the event on Saturday.However officials from LEN, the governing body of European aquatics, confirmed on Sunday that the starting system had been “incorrectly configured” before the afternoon session on the previous day with an investigation determining that the error “resulted in all reported times being 0.10s faster due to a configuration delay of 0.10s”.Affected were races across five events: the women’s 800m freestyle, the men’s 100m breaststroke, the women’s 100m butterfly, the men’s 100m freestyle semi-finals, the women’s 100m breaststroke semi-finals and the men’s 200m butterfly semi-finals.Theoretically, Peaty has now been adjudged to have lowered his mark to 57.10sec, three-hundredths of a second quicker than his winning time at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. But it is unclear whether Fina, the international governing body of the sport, will now ratify the revised time.“We support LEN’s vigilance in this matter and appreciate the time they have taken to make sure all times are correct,” said Chris Spice, the British Swimming performance director.“We want this event to be remembered for the amazing achievements of the athletes so it is important that the results are correct. We don’t want this to take away from Adam’s amazing performance which we all experienced in a fantastic arena.”Peaty, who has still to race the 50m breaststroke on Tuesday, was unavailable for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb13f4d7b2c3f96ba14a069fb5391f590386a002/79_58_2639_1584/master/2639.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97af4b87d5cd5dafb0c65eefca0bd8af","title":"trevor bayliss england ben stokes india second test","story":"Trevor Bayliss, the England head coach, has called on his players to “pick up the slack” at Lord’s this week as Ben Stokes, one of their match-winners from the thrilling first Test with India, misses the game to attend his trial in Bristol.Stokes is due in court on Monday after he and co-defendants Ryan Ali and Ryan Hale pleaded not guilty to a charge of affray in relation to an alleged incident in the Clifton area of the city last September. When he returns to international duty will depend on the Cricket Discipline Committee, which is due to convene after the conclusion of legal\u0026nbspproceedings.In the meantime, and with the second Test against Virat Kohli’s India team starting on Thursday, Joe Root’s side must perform without their talismanic all-rounder, whose demeanour during the series opener at Edgbaston was described as “golden” by Bayliss after his three wickets on the final morning sealed the 31-run win.Bayliss also played down fears that such a high-profile case running in parallel to a Test could prove a distraction to his players, and he pointed to the absence of Stokes during the winter Ashes series as guiding this view.“I’ve got no concerns about it,” Bayliss said. “Ben has no concerns about it as well. Obviously, it’s something we would have liked to have not been happening. That was the same in Australia. But the boys just got on with it. There was a bit of chat before the series but once we got there it was about playing as well as we can.”Looking ahead to the Lord’s Test, Bayliss said his players were “under no illusions” about needing to work on their batting and catching – four chances went down at Edgbaston, albeit with the now-discarded Malan responsible for three of them – but the head coach was encouraged by a bowling performance that exposed some Indian frailties against the Dukes\u0026nbspball. One man reprieved by England’s profligacy was Kohli, who en\u0026nbsproute to a masterful 149 in India’s first innings was put down by Malan on 21 and 51. With exactly 200 runs across the Test – nearly half his side’s output – the right‑hander has now usurped Steve Smith, the suspended former Australia captain, as the world’s No\u0026nbsp1 Test batsman.As a result, Bayliss is keen for his bowlers to keep the remainder of the Indian batting order down at Lord’s and thus heighten the expectations on Kohli. England’s lineup, though, could be viewed as having similar deficiencies and not least against spin, with Ravi Ashwin fresh from seven wickets including Alastair Cook bowled twice.Bayliss said: “We’ve got a few guys who are not cemented in the team and that puts extra pressure on people like Root, Jonny Bairstow and those guys to make the big scores. I don’t think it’ll be any different for India. The way Kohli played was high-class stuff. If we can put pressure on the others, that’s going to add to the pressure on him.“When the ball’s moving, we’ve shown that a few of their guys do struggle. I’m sure that they’ll be going away working out how they can play it, as we’re working on how to play the off-spin.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63ffb76d939ac02ea81522437b524709f90672b7/244_363_5361_3217/master/5361.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5db1fa3daeed51282fcbf689c5627dff","title":"ulster american review traverse edinburgh david ireland","story":"Traverse, EdinburghIn David Ireland’s brilliantly brutal satire, things get horribly out of hand when two men and a woman meet to discuss putting on a West End playTwo men are debating whether Alison Bechdel (who devised the Bechdel test) is a woman. They are arguing in the way only men can: grandstanding, unwavering, pugnacious, even when clearly in the wrong. But don’t worry – post-#MeToo, these two guys are avowed feminists. So feminist they’d like to be women. If only they weren’t so straight. That, at any rate, is what they tell Ruth Davenport, a dramatist from Northern Ireland whose play about a violent Protestant activist they are about to stage in the West End. She, naturally, is having none of it. Nor is she letting them get away with calling her Irish, still less a romantic Catholic nationalist. She’s a UK citizen and proud of it. But in David Ireland’s heady black comedy, a satire as timely as it is riotous, they’re going to keep misdefining her until things get bloody. If Jacobean revenge tragedies were played as uproarious comedy, they’d look like this. The way Ireland sees it, male attitudes to women are akin to the rest of the UK’s attitude to Northern Ireland. They listen but don’t hear, brutalise but plead innocence, call for conversation but merely mansplain. The more Ruth (played by Lucianne McEvoy) protests, the more they shut her down. But in a very 21st-century touch, Ireland gives her all the weapons. He knows that in the era of online scandal a mobile phone primed with an unsent tweet is as unsettling as a loaded stage gun. She has information of Weinstein-level import and is ready to press send. The stakes, in other words, are ratcheting up, and, the higher they go, the more the men reveal their true colours, sometimes hilariously, sometimes painfully. It’s rare to hear an audience repeatedly gasp out loud at the wince-inducing action on stage. Like Jerry Sadowitz, Ireland can make you laugh and doubt the wisdom of your laughter at the same time. As befits the ided times of Brexit Britain, all three characters have turned up in theatre director Leigh Carver’s flat (realised in tasteful shades of grey by designer Becky Minto) under a misapprehension. Leigh (Robert Jack) thinks he’s working on a play that gives voice to the post-referendum anxiety of a nation about to leave Europe. American box-office star Jay Conway (Darrell D’Silva) is convinced his lead role will connect him to his Irish roots. For her part, Ruth arrives with the star-struck ambition of a woman who thinks she’s en route to Hollywood. None of them is right, and it’s their recognition of this that fuels the comedy and the satirical sting. In Gareth Nicholls’ immaculately paced production, all three are superbly realised. Loud and needy, Jay deploys his self-help philosophy like a weapon and shares his liberal values like a threat. Squirming and fidgety, Leigh is all innocent double takes and accommodating smiles until circumstances force him to reveal his petulant core. Ruth, meanwhile, has the quiet determination of a strategist whose territory is coming under sustained attack – she’s patient and polite until she isn’t. In these characters’ assumptions, confusion and rage, Ireland brilliantly captures the bewilderment of a generation that knows the rules of social engagement have changed – whether on gender relations, national identity or global politics – but is hopelessly and hilariously inadequate when it comes to putting the new-found knowledge into practice.

The conference had the ambience of a family reunion. Activists mourned longtime attendees who had died in the past year and shared obscure inside jokes at a beer soaked pub quiz inside the main hall.Despite the broad policy consensus, questions of race and gender still remained for attendees to grapple with.“I’ve got nothing against old, white men,” Mike Lux, a veteran progressive activist, told the crowd Saturday. “Some of my best friends are old, white men. But we’ve got way too many of them in the House and the Senate.”The shift could be seen around the event where a stray Bernie Sanders bumper sticker might be found stuck to the back of a Macbook but attendees were far more likely to wear a T-shirt bearing the image of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as “Alexandria the Great” and issues of racial and economic justice were viewed as fundamentally interwound. “I have a problem with that phrase, ‘identity politics,’” said Senator Kamala Harris of California on Friday. “Let’s be clear – when people say that, it’s a pejorative. That phrase is used to ide and used to distract. Its purpose is to minimize and marginalize issues that impact all of us. It’s used to try and shut us up.”The conference which has a history of disruption by Black Lives Matter activists saw a similar protest on Saturday. But while past events saw activists demand that presidential candidates explicitly state that “Black Lives Matter,” those crowding the stage holding signs saying “#blackasscaucus” were focused on administrative issues.The protesters accused organizers of not inviting enough local activists and demanded that Netroots include them in planning, and better schedule panels and sessions led by people of color, so that they did not conflict with each other. “I see some of you are uncomfortable. Your white fragility is showing. Your white tears are showing – I’m ready to drink them,” one activist told the crowd.When they finished, Rev Angel Kyodo Williams, a zen priest who appeared periodically throughout the conference to lead participants in deep breathing exercises, returned to the stage afterward to praise the room for “holding space for protest”. She asked the crowd to repeat her: “we are going to change it”. “If we can’t change it amongst ourselves at the biggest progressive activists conference how are we going to change it anywhere else?” she told them.  Ocasio-Cortez, who has raised ire in some circles by promoting primary challenges against a number of veteran Democratic elected officials, appealed for unity. “Discourse is not discord,” insisted the Democratic nominee for Congress in a New York district. “Family can argue and that’s alright because we come out healthier on the other end.”Ocasio-Cortez who campaigned as an unapologetic socialist, tried firmly to root her views into the history of the Democratic Party and depicting them as a natural evolution from the policies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. “These are not new ideas,” said Ocasio-Cortez. “We are picking up where we last left off, when we were last our most powerful, when we were our last greatest. It’s time to own that our party was the one of the Great Society, of the New Deal, of the Civil Rights Act. That’s our party. That’s who we are. It’s time for us to come home.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3587128.1533489469!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hundreds latch on at belfast breastfeeding festival","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOver 1,500 people from across Ireland and Scotland registered for Saturday’s Breastival event at the Ulster Museum  which promoted the messages: “normalise, celebrate and support” breastfeeding. Photograph: Amanda FergusonHundreds of women have gathered in Belfast for the second annual Breastival event to celebrate World Breastfeeding Week.Over 1,500 people from across Ireland and Scotland registered for Saturday’s event at the Ulster Museum in the south of the city which promoted the messages: “normalise, celebrate and support”.Some 191 babies and toddlers were breastfed during the ‘Big Latch On’, while politicians took part in a Politics of Milk discussion. This heard calls for MPs to adopt a World Health Organisation (WHO) code on the marketing of breastmilk substitutes and for MLAs to help get legislation in place to promote and protect breastfeeding in public, which has been stalled since Stormont collapsed in January 2017. Jennie Wallace (37) from east Belfast and Jennifer Hanratty from east Belfast via Dundalk decided to set up Breastival in 2017 after DUP MP Sammy Wilson made controversial remarks about breastfeeding.In 2016 the East Antrim MP caused controversy when he said there was an element of voyeurism in women wanting to breastfeed in the House of Commons before amending his comment to “exhibitionism”.The DUP distanced itself from the comments at the time, saying Mr Wilson was expressing a personal view and that it was “vital we continue to promote breastfeeding and ensure adequate public awareness of its benefits”.“We started Breastival last year as a reaction to Sammy Wilson’s comments and because we wanted to do something more than the online support groups,” Jennie said. “Breastfeeding rates in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are some of the worst in the world.” She added: “It’s cultural thing and comments from our politicians don’t help and feed into that culture. It’s generational too. If you haven’t seen your relatives doing it then getting that process started is difficult.”Ms Wallace said celebrity endorsement of breastfeeding from the likes of US model Christine Teigen and positive media coverage like a recent Dispatches documentary was helping change attitudes in Ireland. “It’s not about saying breast is best and being militant, it’s about normalising it and saying its nothing strange, startling or magical is happening, it’s just normal,” she said.“Breastfeeding is normal but it’s not always easy for people. It can have its challenges so we are saying whether you have breastfeed your baby for six day, six months or six years we are saying, well done.Teacher Alison McAlea (28) from Strabane was at the event with her son Daniel and her friends from the Colin Sure Start breastfeeding support group. “Support keeps you going and makes you not want to give up,” she said.“You want to see everyone at the class the following week, and other people’s experiences really help you out if you come across a stumbling block.”Aisling Toner (36) from Belfast was feeding baby daughter Mattie as she spoke to The .Ms Toner explained she was anxious about breastfeeding in public until she joined the Sure Start programme. “I had some problems until I started going to our wee group,” she said.“We were doing an exercise class together and it was the first time I was out in a cafe with other breastfeeding mums so it has been from then.”Claire Allcutt, chair of Baby Feeding Law Group Ireland, based in the Republic, said it want to raise awareness of what she described as inappropriate marketing of breastmilk substitutes.“Breastfeeding is very important, supporting all parents is very important and the protection of optimal feeding is often overlooked,” she said. Dr Maria Herron from sister organisation Code Monitoring Northern Ireland said she was concerned about the marketing of formula and other baby products.“We want to make people aware of the impact formula companies are having on breastfeeding,” she said.“We want parents to have informed choices based on scientific fact.“We have a bottle feeding culture across the island of Ireland so what we are trying to do in calling for the full implementation of the WHO international code is to try to protect mothers, breastfeeding babies and also babies who are formula fed.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Hiqa has undertaken to ensure relevant complaints are now handed overToll lifted on tunnel in Limerick to ease congestion as cars back up for 10kmIrish Hotels Federation says it is \u0026lsquoabsolutely incredible\u0026rsquo Government wants to change tax rateMorgan Pinder believed to have died instantly when car overturned after hitting ditchParty leader says vote a key priority a week after claiming Brexit uncertainty requires delaySimon Harris tweets that religion \u0026lsquowill not determine\u0026rsquo health policy after Bishop of Elphin says contraceptive ban \u0026lsquoignored for too long\u0026rsquoSecond annual Breastival event aims to \u0026lsquonormalise, celebrate and support\u0026rsquo feedingUnprecedented odyssey has even united politicians who can\u0026rsquot agree on anything elseSports body moves to clarify situation regarding funding of World Cup campaignBishop of Elphin Kevin Doran links \u0026lsquocontraceptive mentality\u0026rsquo to support for gay marriageAward-winning Donegal-born fiddle player, composer and Bothy Band member dies at 70Ballivor GFC in Co Meath votes to share facilities with builders of Narconon centreAnti-racism group removes posts about Sylva\u0026rsquos death after friend urge death being politicisedCampaigners renew call for marriage equality to be extended to Northern IrelandSixteen councillors say now is not the time to change the party leadershipNational Monuments Service told about newly revealed outline of house in Co MeathYounger bike users advised to slow down over weekend to avoid spike in accidentsMary Manning and her colleagues praised for their support of human rights\u0026lsquoPeople should not jump in without being fully aware of what is under the surface\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3587064.1533473177!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland s all conquering women s hockey team go for gold in the world cup final","story":"Joyous scenes as hockey supporters at Railway Union Sports Club in Sandymount, Dublin and the Glenside Pub, Churchtown near the Loreto Hockey Club celebrate as Ireland Ladies qualify for the World Cup final.

Photograph: Christopher LeeGetty ImagesOnce more unto the breach - Ireland’s women’s hockey team go for gold in the World Cup final on Sunday in London. They face the seven times winners of the tournament, Netherlands, who are 71 on to win with some bookies. They are full-time professionals and hockey is the national sport for women. The Irish women are amateurs, but they surpassed expectations and then some by getting to the final - the first Irish team to get to a senior world final in any field sport. Ireland’s unlikely odyssey to the final, they were the second lowest seed, has united the whole island. The final comes just 24 hours after the semi-final in which they beat Spain after a penalty shoot-out that went to sudden death.The DUP and Sinn Féin do not agree on much, but their respective leaders in the North have both tweeted their support. DUP leader Arlene Foster tweeted: “Absolutely brilliant result for the Ireland ladies hockey team on reaching the World Cup final. @IreWomenHockey inspiring a generation of young players! #HWC2018”. Sinn Féin leader in the North Michelle O’Neill tweeted: “What a result for the Irish women’s hockey team reaching the World Cup final. We are all behind you girls”. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald echoed her comments: “It has been said so many times but is still worthy of repetition - the Irish women’s’ hockey team is legend.” Abie Meeke, the mother of Ireland midfielder Ali Meeke, said many of the Irish supporters in London are walking around as if in a daze and expect to wake up and realise that Ireland are not really in the World Cup final. “It’s find it difficult to find the words to describe how real it is. The place was buzzing last night. It’s rare you hear The Fields of Athenry after a hockey match,” she said. Mrs Meeke said many hockey federations that expected to be in the final have handed back their tickets and all the Irish fans who want a ticket for the final will be there, though not all were able to book flights and accommodation in time. Win or lose the team will be coming home on Monday and the Lord Mayor of Dublin Cllr Nial Ring has promised a civic reception for them on Monday or at a later date.  The match can be followed on a liveblog on The  website, starting from 4.30pm."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3586920.1533472755!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no irish squad member has to pay 550 levy says hockey ireland","story":"Joyous scenes as hockey supporters at Railway Union Sports Club in Sandymount, Dublin and the Glenside Pub, Churchtown near the Loreto Hockey Club celebrate as Ireland Ladies qualify for the World Cup final.

Photograph: Sandra MailerInphoHockey Ireland has moved to clarify how the Irish women’s hockey squad is funded, saying it was not the case that the players lining out in Sunday’s World Cup final had to pay €550 each to represent Ireland.The sports body said for the past two years the players have not had to pay the levy.Prior to 2016 players, a levy of €550 per player was applied, a cost that was covered by the squad in 2015 and 2016 by running fundraisers.Sport Ireland chief executive John Tracey confirmed that the present team played no levies and have not done so since the Rio Olympics qualification campaign. “We got the funding up to a level where that didn’t happen anymore to ensure that those athletes didn’t have to go out raising funds,” he said. Mr Tracey said Sporting Ireland provided expense money for the players of €45,000 spread over a squad of 40 women. He said Irish hockey had got €520,000 from the high performance unit this year, an additional €60,000 for both the men and women’s World Cup campaigns and €45,000 from Sport Ireland’s carding programme. They also got €220,000 in co-funding from private sponsors. “We would love to be giving them more, but we are limited in terms of our own budget,” he told RTÉ’s This Week programme. “Our budget is about €10 million in terms of high performance sport.” Mr Tracey said the Government plans to double sports funding over the next 10 years from €110 million to €220 million. “That is the level of funding we need to compete at this level. Clearly we need investment very quickly in terms of high performance sport with Tokyo (2020 Olympics) coming up,” he said. There has been criticism from various quarters this week of the level of financial support Hockey Ireland has got in recent years.DUP leader Arlene Foster was among the politicians who congratulated the Irish women on their success. She tweeted: “Absolutely brilliant result for the Ireland ladies hockey team on reaching the World Cup final. @IreWomenHockey inspiring a generation of young players! #HWC2018”. Lord Mayor of Dublin Cllr Nial Ring said he intends to organise a civic reception for the team when they come back to Dublin on Monday.

Photograph: North West NewspixOmagh man Kevin Skelton shakes his head when asked what he thinks about former DUP leader Peter Robinson’s advice to unionists that they need to think about preparing for a Border poll which could lead to Irish unity.He later pleaded guilty in an Irish court to unlawful assembly, and paid a large fine, thus avoiding a jail term but earning the nickname, Peter the Punt. “I know what I’d do with a Border poll, where I’d push it,” says Skelton.“I couldn’t give a hoot, couldn’t care less. The south of Ireland doesn’t want us, doesn’t need us and can’t afford us. If the vote was held on both sides of the Border they’d likely reject us. Peter Robinson and Mary Lou McDonald would be better putting their time into getting the assembly back together. There’s none of them wants to deal with the past.”Skelton’s wife Mena was one of the 31 people (including unborn twins) murdered in Omagh when the Real IRA’s massive 1998 carbomb exploded without warning on Main Street. Prepared in the Republic, it had been driven north, passing through Clontibret, and across the border into Tyrone.Relatives and friends are bracing themselves for the 20th anniversary on the 15th of this month. The views of the survivors are as erse as the backgrounds from which their loved ones came and Skelton does not claim to speak for anyone other than himself, though his anger at what he sees as the neglect of the victims is widely shared. He thinks a Border poll is irrelevant, and that Brexit is the critical issue.“My fear is that Brexit could start the Troubles up again. I’d be out of here if there was a hard border,” he said. However, he also believes that the real Border in Northern Ireland is the river Bann. The newly released NI statistics on deprivation support his view that the most prosperous areas are in the northeast, with the western Border areas among the most disadvantaged.“Omagh was already struggling on the shavings from the table, and it never recovered from the bomb,” said Skelton. “It is well on its way to being a ghost town.”Further north and further west, the city of Derry has lately been in the news because of a flare up of street violence among young people under the influence of dissident republicans. The violence included sectarian attacks on the Fountain estate, a tiny unionist enclave alongside the old city walls on the by now almost entirely nationalist west bank of the river Foyle.On Wednesday night a remarkably civil and wideranging debate took place on the other side of the river, the largely unionist Waterside, in a Protestant church hall. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald and DUP MP and chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson were among the speakers discussing the future of the Northern state.The event was one of 40 in the New Gate Fringe Festival, organised by the North West Cultural Partnership, which includes the Londonderry Bands Forum the membership of which is drawn from young men from some of the most deprived loyalist estates in the region. Public debates including working class nationalists and republicans have long been a feature of Northern political life. An audience predominantly made up, as this one was, of working class unionists is far more rare.“What’s your take, Sir Jeffrey?” said June Elder. Donaldson said the DUP was very clear on the question. “Peter does not speak for the DUP. He is retired. I do,” he said. “I don’t share his view.”Considering such a poll would polarise people and cause further ision, he had not had a single email from a constituent about it. “We are preparing for Brexit.”Elder came back after his response with a supplementary question. “So was Peter just off on a rant?” she asked. “No,” said Donaldson with a tight smile. “He was expressing his opinion.”“Well,” retorted Elder, sceptically, to laughter. “My TV shows the same as yours.”Joe Thompson said he was a unionist but he was angry with the DUP. “For decades they’ve insisted this part of the country is British and now with Brexit they say it can’t be treated any differently from England, Scotland and Wales,” he said. “But people are treated differently when it comes to reproductive rights, marriage rights and the Irish language act.”Donaldson said devolution meant that different parts of the UK would have different laws. He said the place to legislate for the issues Thompson raised was at Stormont and reiterated his party leader Arlene Foster’s accusation that Sinn Féin was “holding to ransom” the parties which wished to resume powersharing. “We no longer have a veto,” he said, pointing out that to use a “petition of concern” to block new legislation 30 votes were needed. “We only have 28,” he said.McDonald retorted that Foster had just that morning backed the use of a blocking mechanism to prevent a local council from flying the rainbow flag this weekend, Saturday August 4th, as part of LGBTQ Pride events around the North.Afterwards, Thompson, who works in Derry and lives in Mid Ulster, told The  he was not satisfied with Donaldson’s response. “The DUP is coming across as just so arrogant,” he said. “They’d get their 30 votes to block progressive change – they know it and so do we. I support the union but I vote Alliance now. Peter Robinson was right to say what he did about a Border poll. It is going to happen and the chaos that followed the Brexit vote showed that we need preparations.”The audience at the debate strikingly included many young people. On his way out after an intense 2½ hours, Chris Smith said a Border poll would be pointless. “It is not a question people need answered,” he said. “I am a unionist and I want the politicians either to get Stormont up and running or go back to Direct Rule. As it is we are losing out every way. My girlfriend works in the NHS here and she has just had to forego a payrise that colleagues elsewhere are getting. My mate is a firefighter but because of cuts his job is about to be lost.”Julia Kee, a community worker on a programme made possible by the EU’s Peace 4 funding, shared this view. “We have more important things to be thinking about than a Border poll,” she said. “I am a unionist and we have been hearing nothing but this anti-choice, anti-LGBT rights talk from the DUP.“The political impasse is creating political unrest around Northern Ireland including here in this city,” she said. “Then you get politicians calling young people scumbags and that does not help.”Hospital consultant Fergal McNicholl is from Greysteel, the Co Derry village which became internationally known after loyalists burst into a pub there in 1993 and sprayed it with gunfire, killing eight people. He came to the debate at the invitation of his friend, Dave Duggan, a writer from the city.“I felt quite privileged to be here tonight,” said McNicholl. “It was very impressive that they got a mixed audience and the fact that there was no tension was a massive step forward.” He was not inclined to favour preparing for a Border poll. “The territorial issue puts our identity back into conflict – I quite like it the way it was,” he said. “There was a period where I felt I could be comfortably Irish in this town and live beside someone who was comfortably British. Brexit has already raised territorial issues. It makes things harder. It unsettles us.”Georgina Campbell is a young dancer. She told the panel that she was worried and wanted to know if, in a new Ireland, the likes of her would have a place. She said that the Highland dancing that is her medium is rooted in British military history and that the highest honour available is to dance for the queen. Afterwards, she explained that a Border poll meant nothing to her.“We should just have a government,” she said. “My three best friends are nationalist girls who are self-employed artists. Highland dancers and Irish dancers work together on a regular basis, but a lot of our cultural activities are in our own communities. Northern Ireland is unique and special. We need to embrace it and we need to market it. It is just this big mad eclectic place. I love it so much – I’ll never move away.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3585880.1533323004!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"superstar judge emerges as an unlikely champion for liberals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSupreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has a cult-like following. Photograph: by Michael KovacGetty ImagesSometimes heroes come from the most unlikely places. For millions of progressive Americans who continue to look on aghast at Donald Trump’s presidency, there was some good news this week.On Sunday night, Twitter lit up with breaking news.Supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had just suggested during an interview in New York that she would stay on the bench for at least five more years.The joy was unfettered. #RuthBaderGinsburg was trending on the social media platform, while fans across the country expressed their joy. “I hope you live forever, RBG,” said one.\u0026nbspThe 85-year-old Ginsburg has become an unlikely champion of liberals across the country, attracting a cult-like following usually reserved for pop stars or celebrities.The roots of her fame began at the start of this decade. After a number of dissenting judgments, including in the famous Shelby County v Holder case on voting rights, she was incarnated as an internet meme, which compared her to the rapper Notorious BIG.Such was the meme’s popularity that its creator teamed up with an MSNBC journalist to pen a book, Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It became a New York Times bestseller.Earlier this summer a film adaptation of the book hit cinemas across the US, cementing her celebrity. Outside the movie theatre in Georgetown fans queued up outside the lifesize cardboard cutout of RBG for photos.The film recounts the story of Ginsburg’s life, tracing her career trajectory from her upbringing in a Jewish household in Brooklyn in the 1930s to her appointment by Bill Clinton to the supreme court in 1993.Having graduated from Cornell, she went to Harvard Law School, one of nine women in the 500-strong class. She recounts in the film how she was scolded by a dean for taking a seat that could have been occupied by a man. These early experiences of prejudice informed her career as a lawyer.In the 1960s and 1970s she rose to prominence, taking on – and winning – landmark cases on gender equality. She argued six gender discrimination cases before the US supreme court between 1973 and 1976, including a case which successfully argued that widowers – as well as widows – should be eligible for social security payments if they choose to mind children in the home after the death of a spouse.While the film charts Ginsburg’s remarkable career, it also sheds light on her personal life.Throughout the film, Ginsburg’s natural reserve and seriousness comes through, an antidote to the gregarious personality of her late husband, who remained a constant presence by her side before his death in 2010. But it shows how the elegant octogenarian has embraced her recent fame with a bemused, tongue-in-cheek air.The film includes footage of the justice working out with her personal trainer, and watching Saturday Night Live impersonations of herself on TV.Her friendship with the late Antonin Scalia, her colleague on the supreme court, is also explored. Their friendship, despite their very different political leanings, is a reminder of the importance of bipartisanship at a time when America is so ided politically.Ginsburg’s promise to remain on the bench for at least five years has been greeted with relief by her fans, amid concerns about her health in recent years. She has survived cancer, twice, and was famously caught napping during the State of the Union address in 2015.Trump has so far been gifted the appointment of two supreme court nominees – Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who is expected to be confirmed by the senate in the autumn. Liberals do not want the 45th president to have the opportunity to nominate a third.Ginsburg’s comments this week emerged as Kavanaugh continued to meet privately with senators on Capitol Hill as Washington starts to wind down for the summer. His confirmation hearing is expected to take place next month, with Republicans aiming to have the conservative nominee in place by the opening of the new court session on October 1st.While Kavanaugh is likely to face a tough confirmation hearing – his statements that he does not believe sitting presidents should be prosecuted have raised eyebrows – Republicans have the majority needed to approve him.Ginsburg, however, seems willing to stick the pace until a Democratic president is in place. For many, it is proof that she is a real patriot.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Earthquake kills 19 as tremors hit Lombok and BaliCharity founded by Prince Charles in ding dong over maker of Big Ben\u0026#39s bells England\u0026#39s top GP forced to resign after using fake account to troll doctors Comment: What can we learn from walking?

These are worrying times for all British horses.”In guidance issued for owners and breeders, The British Horse Society warned owners to be on the look out for the virus. “With climate change and an increase in the international movement of horses there is a possibility that AHS could reach Britain, although the risk is not presently considered to be high,” said the BHS.“However, were AHS to arrive on these shores it is imperative that it is spotted quickly in order that it can be dealt with rapidly and prevented from spreading.“It is possible that an AHS outbreak could occur in the UK if the virus were to be imported and, given the severe welfare and economic consequences of AHS, this would have devastating consequences to the naïve UK equine population.”There is currently no good vaccine against the disease. The main vaccine, which is not licensed in Europe, has in some cases actually caused outbreaks of the disease in AfricaThe Equine Disease Coalition, which was established in 2011 to prevent outbreaks in Britain, is currently working towards an improved vaccine.Please review our commenting policyEarthquake kills 19 as tremors hit Lombok and BaliCharity founded by Prince Charles in ding dong over maker of Big Ben\u0026#39s bells England\u0026#39s top GP forced to resign after using fake account to troll doctors Comment: What can we learn from walking?

Congregations in poorer areas are also less likely to be able to contribute financially. Andy Delmege, vicar at St Bede’s Brandwood in Birmingham and chair the National Estates Churches Network, which promotes inner city churches, said: Why should ministry be harder in Birmingham or Newcastle or Manchester because they are newer diocese formed without historic assets? This inequality makes life harder for the parishes and clergy which are at the sharp end of it.We might want to ask what the gospel says on this. Well it certainly doesn\u0027t advocate a postcode lottery.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Sunday programme that they need to urgently work out ways of justly sharing our historic wealth. Of the ten diocese with the largest income in England, eight are in the south. His comments follow those of the Rt Rev Philip North, the Bishop of Burnley, who said there was a \u0027shocking disparity between diocese and that the situation in Leeds was a symptom of a much deeper financial and spiritual institutional sickness.Nick Baines, Bishop of Leeds, yesterday described his fellow Bishop\u0027s comments as nonsense. The Reverend Canon Sam Corley, the Rector of Leeds, said that a cheque from the south would be nice but would not solve the issues facing the future of inner city churches and those in deprived areas.  Church of EnglandEarthquake kills 19 as tremors hit Lombok and BaliCharity founded by Prince Charles in ding dong over maker of Big Ben\u0026#39s bells England\u0026#39s top GP forced to resign after using fake account to troll doctors Comment: What can we learn from walking?

Turns out I just needed to go walking in Leytonstone instead.RSPCA inspector Rebecca Bedson said: “We received a call yesterday morning reporting a stray snake in High Road, Leytonstone. I arrived to find the boa constrictor in a box and transported him to a wildlife centre where he is currently being assessed.The boa constrictor was seen eating the pigeon in Leytonstone, east London “I’m very keen to find out how he came to be in such a dangerous situation. Exposed like that on a street could have meant anything might have happened to him, he could have been run over by a car or attacked by another animal.“It might be that he is an escaped pet, or more worryingly, someone may have deliberately dumped him and left him to fend for himself. Either way, anybody with any information can give me a call in complete confidence on our inspector’s appeal line by phoning 0300 123 8018.” The charity said that it is encountering widespread neglect of reptiles as many people are unaware of how much of a commitment these animals are when they take them on.  As a result they now rescue hundreds each year. Earthquake kills 19 as tremors hit Lombok and BaliCharity founded by Prince Charles in ding dong over maker of Big Ben\u0026#39s bells England\u0026#39s top GP forced to resign after using fake account to troll doctors Comment: What can we learn from walking?

Where conventional products burn tobacco to produce smoke, e-cigarettes propel nicotine with propylene glycerol in a vapour, which is inhaled. As with regular cigarettes, it is illegal in the UK for under-18s to buy e-cigarettes.In February, Public Health England recommended that e-cigarettes were prescribed on the NHS, alongside nicotine replacement products such as nicotine patches, gum and inhalators.Charity founded by Prince Charles in ding dong over maker of Big Ben\u0026#39s bells England\u0026#39s top GP forced to resign after using fake account to troll doctors Comment: What can we learn from walking?

So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/12/12/mark-billingham-1.jpg","title":"long reads hero sas who dares wins culture tv marvel","story":"Created with Sketch.Is he a Marvel-esque superhuman or an SAS daredevil?

Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?T.E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

But we know a growing percentage are kept indoors in Britain and never experience sunlight on their backs or grass under their feet.\u0026nbspBernard Matthews labels show the countryside with green grass but the reality of life for their turkeys is probably anything but outdoors. We suspect they are raised intensively because the company doesn\u0027t participate in any assurance schemes.He added: “If consumers could see behind closed doors they’d be shocked.\u0026nbspIf a pig is kept intensively all its life – with mother sows unable to even turn around to interact with her young – shoppers should be told.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspbrands we\u0027ve highlighted are just the tip of the iceberg - there are many out there with misleading labels.​CiWF is about to launch a petition calling on the government to make it compulsory for food firms to state the method of production on labels.“Labels on intensively reared products frequently display misleading images of rolling landscapes and happy animals, when in reality the livestock are crammed into barren cages, kept indoors all their lives or kept in such close confinement that they are unable to express their natural behaviours,” Bronwen Reinhardt, honest labelling campaign manager at CiWF.Misleading slogans and images undermine farmers who genuinely operate to high welfare standards, she said.Earlier this year the environment department (Defra) ran a public consultation on the future of food and farming after Brexit, with a document that said: “It is not always clear to the consumer what standards underpin welfare terminology and definitions on labels, such as ‘grass-fed’, can vary between retailers. We are considering whether providing greater clarity of information to consumers could support higher welfare production.”In a speech in January, environment secretary Michael Gove said: “I want us, outside the European Union, to develop new approaches to food labelling… there’s still no single, scaled, measure of how a farmer or food producer performs against a sensible basket of indicators, taking into account such things as soil health, control of pollution, contribution to water quality as well as animal welfare.“We’ve been in discussion with farmers and food producers about how we might advance such a scheme and I think that, outside the EU, we could establish a measure of farm and food quality which would be world-leading.”More appropriate slogans would be ‘raised in confinement’ or ‘grown quickly without access to the outdoors’Mr Gifford said what’s needed is a system similar to that introduced for eggs in 2004 that made production method labelling compulsory, after which free-range and organic egg sales “went through the roof”.Mandatory production and slaughter method labelling was one policy Labour promised in its 50-point animal-welfare plan published in February.As milk prices have fallen in recent years, under-pressure farmers have moved towards more intensive systems, building vast sheds packed with dairy cows who are fed not on grass but on protein-heavy diets to boost milk production.Research by World Animal Protection has found Britain now has about 100 industrial “mega-farms”, each housing up to 3,000 cows that are kept permanently indoors.CiWF)Many farms keep cattle indoors some of the time and allow them outdoors at other times.But some have estimated that all “zero-grazing” systems – accused of causing painful lameness and mastitis because cows stand on concrete floors for prolonged periods – are in place in one in five British dairy farms.\u0026nbspAccording to Labelling Matters, a coalition of groups lobbying since 2011 for a law on production method labelling, such a step would benefit not just shoppers and farm animals but farmers too, creating a level playing field for them.A spokeswoman for Mondelez, which owns the Dairylea brand, said: “The farmers that supply to us graze their cows whenever weather conditions and location allows, and wherever this is appropriate and manageable from their perspective.\u0026nbspTherefore, it is not practical or possible for us to guarantee that 100 per cent of the cows providing our milk can graze 100 per cent of the time.\u0026nbsp“Ensuring that suppliers take good care of their herds is fundamental to ensuring our cheeses are made with high-quality milk.

And why might there be a plot to kill him?The son of a prominent trade union leader, Mr Maduro was born in 1962 into a working class family. He went on to demonstrate his own strong political convictions when he became president of the student union at Jose Avalos high school in El Valle, on the edge of Caracas.He never graduated, according to records, and started working as a bus driver for the Caracas  company. There, he joined the Socialist League and established one of the company’s first informal labour syndicates, due to a ban on formal unionisation in the company at the time.Mr Maduro met erstwhile Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez in December 1993 and became a central figure in his Bolivarian Movement, helping to launch the Movement for the Fifth Republic in 1997, which backed Chávez’s presidential run. In 1998, Mr Chávez won a groundbreaking electoral victory and Mr Maduro was elected as an MP.Mr ​Maduro’s political rise continued and in 1999 he helped draft a new constitution, before going on to serve as deputy at the national assembly. In 2000, he moved to head up the body.Mr Chávez named Mr Maduro as minister of foreign affairs in 2006 and he went on to make a number\u0026nbspof inflammatory statements while in the role.When, in 2007, then-US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice criticised the Venezualan government for closing a private television station, Mr Maduro called her a hypocrite and compared Guantánamo Bay to Nazi concentration camps.Mr Maduro became interim leader when Chávez died in March 2013 and won a six-year term in office by only a narrow margin the following month. Since then, like his predecessor, Mr Maduro has proved a isive figure.Support for his presidency has been ravaged by devastating economic deterioration. Under his government, Venezuela entered a recession, inflation skyrocketed and shortages of basic provisions became commonplace.Few expected the leader to be able to win a second term. But he did, securing a second mandate in a presidential election in May. His main rivals disavowed the election, alleging massive irregularities.His administration has drawn widespread criticised from a number of countries for undermining democracy and violating human rights. Last year, dozens of protesters were killed in clashes during anti-government protests.The president has steadily concentrated power, setting up a new constituent assembly with the power to bypass and even dissolve the opposition-led National Assembly. The EU and major Latin American nations have refused to recognise the new body.While Mr Maduro\u0026nbsphas clung on to the support of certain organisations such as the military, his critics are many.A little known group calling itself Soldiers in T-shirts claimed responsibility for the assassination attempt, saying it planned to fly two drones loaded with explosives at the president, but government soldiers shot them down before reaching its target.“We showed that they are vulnerable,” the group said in a tweet. “It was not successful today, but it is just a matter of time.”Since Mr Maduro\u0027s\u0026nbspelection and the economic downturn, opposition parties have rallied together against him, accusing him of driving the economy into the ground, violating human rights and manipulating\u0026nbspdemocratic processes.Mr\u0026nbspMaduro\u0026nbsphas said the country\u0026nbspis the victim of an “economic war” waged by opposition leaders aided by Washington.The diplomatic relationship between Venezuala\u0026nbspand Colombia has also become increasing fraught, as many Venezuelans have been driven into the neighbouring country by\u0026nbsphyperinflation, food and medicine shortages.Last week, Colombia granted more than 440,000 migrants permission to stay in the country for two years and the Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has been a vocal critic of Mr Maduro“The whole world is ever more terrified by what is happening in Venezuela,” he said last week. “Such a rich country, a country with the largest oil reserves in the whole world, with a population that is dying of hunger and dying of disease for lack of medicine.”Colombia refused to recognise Mr Maduro’s\u0026nbspvictory at the\u0026nbsppresidential election in May, and accused\u0026nbspregime of giving Venezuelan identification cards to Colombians​.A turbulent year in VenezuelaDemonstrators scuffle with security forces during an opposition rally in Caracas, Venezuela, April 4, 2017.

Overheated waters can result in mass fish die-offs, like those that occurred in Germany this week.The shutdowns are just the latest inconvenience in the heat wave that has descended on much of Europe in recent weeks. A drought sweeping Switzerland has left herds of cows stranded without water. The\u0026nbspcountry’s helicopter association and Air Force have been called to transport tens of thousands of gallons of water every week to sustain them.Earlier this week, officials warned vacationers in Portugal and Spain\u0026nbspto stay indoors, as parts of the region reached record-setting high temperatures.

At least three people in Spain have already reportedly died from heatstroke.Wildfires have also sprung up in Portugal’s Algarve, mirroring the deadly fires burning in Greece, Sweden, and the west coast of the United States. Scientists previously told The Independent that such fires were becoming more common, and more intense, due to climate change.A recently released study from the University of Oxford found that climate change had more than doubled the likelihood of the current heat wave.“The logic that climate change will do this is inescapable – the world is becoming warmer and so heatwaves like this are becoming more common,” said one of the report’s authors, Dr Friederike Otto, deputy director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford.“What was once regarded as unusually warm weather will become commonplace – in some cases, it already has, he said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/05/17/steven-seagal-putin.jpg","title":"steven seagal us russia envoy hollywood putin humanitarian","story":"Created with Sketch.Hollywood actor who once\u0026nbspdescribed Vladimir Putin as\u0026nbsp\u0027one of the greatest world leaders’,\u0026nbspwas granted Russian citizenship in 2016Click to followThe Independent OnlinePresident Putin shakes hands with Steven Seagal during a meeting at the Kremlin in November 2016Russia has appointed martial artist and action film star Steven Seagal\u0026nbspas a special envoy to improve ties with the United States.\u0026nbspIn a Facebook post, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced that the Under Siege as been appointed to a new role, which allegedly will\u0026nbspbe unpaid.His responsibility will be to “facilitate relations between Russia and the United States in the humanitarian field, including cooperation in culture, arts, public and youth exchanges.”In 2015,\u0026nbspBuzzFeed\u0026nbspNews reported that two years earlier, Vladimir Putin had suggested to then President Barack Obama that he could make Mr Seagal\u0026nbspthe honorary Russian consul to California and Arizona.\u0026nbsp​Then in November 2016, Mr Seagal visited the Russian president at the Kremlin and was granted Russian citizenship.\u0026nbspSeagal\u0027s grandmother was born in Vlaostok\u0026nbspand the actor and Mr Putin share a passion for martial arts.In a 2013 interview with news channel RT, Seagal\u0026nbspsaid he believed Mr Putin was\u0026nbspone of the greatest world leaders, if not the greatest world leader, alive today.”\u0026nbspSteven Seagal accused of rape by extra from 1994 filmSteven Seagal calls female reporters \u0027a bunch of f***ing dirty whores\u0027Steven Seagal comments on NFL protests, debuts bizarre new lookBut Seagal has faced some criticism for some comments he has made about the controversial Russian leader.After he\u0026nbsppraised Putin\u0027s annexation of Crimea,\u0026nbspKiev banned\u0026nbspSeagal\u0026nbspfrom entering Ukraine for five years, claiming he had\u0026nbsp“committed socially dangerous actions” that could threaten their security.\u0026nbspSeagal was also granted Serbian citizenship in 2016, after he offered\u0026nbspto open a martial arts academy in Belgrade.The action film star has also met with Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Belarusan President Alexander Lukashenko.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/998869_1.jpg","title":"Brexit news theresa may eu divisions chequers brexit plan latest","story":"Mrs May met her French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Friday and while the French insisted that the meeting did not show Macron was prepared to \u0026ldquospeak in place of the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr Jones suggested that the talks between the leaders showed a growing desire for them to take hold of negotiations.Last weekend Mrs May also secured the chance to put her proposals to EU heads of state at an informal summit on September 20.Mr Jones, a minister for Brexit for a year between 2016 and 2017, said that now was the time to dump the Chequers plan, which involves staying in the single market in all but name.A number of ministers, including David Davis and Boris Johnson, quit in protest at the proposals, saying they would water down Brexit and leave Britain in \u0026ldquomiserable, permanent limbo.                Expert warns only way to get Brexit deal is to remain in customs unionMr Jones said: \u0026ldquoThe Chequers proposal has not met with the approval of the public and has undoubtedly caused problems for the party.\u0026ldquoBut the isions opening up among EU member states now offer the Prime Minister a real opportunity to get Brexit back on track.\u0026ldquoShe should take full advantage of these isions and mount a serious attempt to secure a Canada-style free trade deal.\u0026ldquoShe should also make it clear that if the EU does not agree to this, Britain is entirely happy to revert to World Trade Organisation terms of trade, which will be sufficient for the UK.Tory MP Andrew Bridgen agreed that the time is right for a rethink.\u0026nbspHe said: \u0026ldquoTheresa May should use this excuse to dump the toxic Chequers proposals.The Prime Minister now has an opportunity to get the UK\u0026rsquos departure \u0026ldquoback on track (Image: )Mrs May met her French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Friday (Image: AFP)No10 has remained tight-lipped about the outcome of the Macron meeting.

And that you think the scaremongering from the Government is utterly ridiculous.Hell, the Remainers think WE’RE gullible. For having believed the “lies” of the Brexit campaign.But it is hard to imagine anyone could be quite so stupid as to really believe we’ll be short of food if we tell our European friends to shove their deal where the sun doesn’t shine.They even had a debate on Remainer Central (that’s BBC Newsnight to you and me) about what we could put in our sandwiches if we fail to sign a deal. Basically it came down to Kirsty Wark’s toenail clippings and Evan Davis’s nostril hair. That’s your lot.Do they really think we’re that stupid? We’re not at war, you know. We’re just leaving an undemocratic bureaucracy.Do these dingbats really think that the Spanish tomato growers and the Dutch pig farmers are going to refuse to sell us anything? Or that we would refuse to buy their produce? Get real.The debate about whether we should leave or remain in the EU was pretty shoddy. There was exaggeration and outlandish claims made by both sides.I never believed the rubbish about an extra £350million a week for the NHS. And if I’d thought we were going to do that I’d probably have voted Remain. If ever there was a waste of money, that would be it.The difference is, the Remainers believe all the crap that’s spouted by their side. Every bit of it.Just as they believed the economy would be wrecked within a week of the vote. When actually it has been doing very well indeed and is projected to do even better.Sky fallen in yet? Nope. Instead we’re busy sorting out new trade deals with, among others, Japan and Australia. Employment is booming, unemployment is the lowest for decades, wages are rising and inflation is coming down.And so the Project Fearmongers dream up another nightmare scenario which exists only in their weird imaginations. We’ll all starve! No medicines!The threats come from our own remainers — but also from within the EU. Especially (quelle surprise) the awful French.Have you ever known a people more clingy? Listen, mon ami — it’s over, we’re leaving. Our bags are packed and ready in the hallway.It was fun while it lasted (well, actually, it wasn’t THAT much fun) but now we’re going. Try to get over it. And stop the blackmail, you ludicrous little people.Jeremy Hunt — never my favourite politician — has at least started well as our new Foreign Secretary.Warning the EU that it will lose far more than the UK if there’s no deal.No kidding, Jezza.We import far more from the EU than we sell to them. There is not the slightest danger of those imports being prevented from arriving here. To suggest otherwise is utterly absurd.OH God, Madonna’s at it again. Showing off her a*** in a Versace dress.Lying on the ground in stockings with her baps poking out in Vogue magazine.Madge turns 60 in a few days, for gawd’s sake. I have a terrible vision of her doing the same thing in 30 years’ time. Riding a Stannah stairlift wearing a leather basque, with a Gucci colostomy bag.I’m not saying she hasn’t aged well – certainly better than me. But have some dignity, woman.She’s apparently moved to Lisbon to get away from Donald Trump. I think Donald’s well out of it.THE serial anti-Semite Jeremy Corbyn is in trouble again.He has apologised after hosting a meeting where Israel was compared to Nazi Germany.A meeting which took place on Holocaust Remembrance Day! It’s hard to think of something more obviously anti-Semitic.But why did he apologise? He still thinks the same thing.He has never met with a senior Israeli government member. He has gone out of his way to avoid meeting the Israeli Prime Minister. He has called the genocidal Islamist terrorists Hamas his “friends”. He has failed to take action against the virulent Jew-hating in his party.He’s not sorry at all about having attended that foul gathering.He’s only sorry it got him into more bother.So, an anti-Semite and a hypocrite.Salman repaid that kindness by murdering 22 children and adults at the Manchester Arena.The lesson? Disengage with these foul Islamist countries. Leave them to it. Our people have rights.And they supersede the rights of fundamentalist Muslim fanatics to claim asylum in the civilised, Christian, West.SO, the courts have decided that people who don’t necessarily want the right to die can have the right to die if other people think it’s best for them.What a bizarre judgment.This applies largely to elderly people in a locked-in state, that is a persistent vegetative state. If the doctors and relatives think it’s time to turn off the life support, they can now do so.But people sometimes recover from these conditions. And you can imagine the conversation between the docs and rellies, can’t you?Doc: “I’m afraid your dad is showing about as much life as a recently gassed badger. Probably not going to get much better, frankly.”Relly: “Oh, that’s a shame.”Doc: “Yes. And we rather need his bed for another old gadgie who’s about to pop his clogs. Did you like him much, your dad?”Relly: “Um…bit of a miserable old git, really. Cantankerous. Suffered from bad flatulence too, in later years . . .Doc: “Still does!”Relly: “But we’d be very interested in what his . . . you know . . . will has to say. If you catch my drift.”Doc: “Ah, indeed. Well . . . you could find that out very quickly . . .  if I just flicked this switch . . . ”Relly: “Hmm. Well, you know doc, I think it’s what he would have wanted.”Doc: “Exactly. It’s what he would have wanted. Now, say goodbye and contact your lawyer.”THERE’S a new dictionary of rhyming slang. Updated to include references to contemporary slebs.So – “I’m in bed with a really nasty Miley”. Means Miley Cyrus – virus.And: “This is Bob. He’s my Beyonce.” Beyonce – fiance.See? They’ve missed a few out though . . .“I haven’t been to the toilet for weeks. The doctor says I’ve got a blockage in the old Simon.” (Cowell).“Could be worse, mate. You could have a tumour on your Samantha.” (Janus).“Well, I did worry about that. Suggested it to the doctor. But he said I was being a silly old Jeremy.”(Our Foreign Secretary).GREAT – the Bush Is Back, according to Vogue magazine.Women are no longer ripping out the furze around their lady- gardens, but letting it all grow. And perhaps adding a rockery, a trellis for roses and a small pond with a plastic heron.About time, really. I’ve always thought there was something ever-so-slightly dodgy about a bloke who liked women shaved bare.I was never much more taken with those landing strips, either. Last one I saw was like the size of Terminal 5 at Heathrow. Half expected a team of baggage handlers to turn up in one of those carts.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Most sickeningly, he allegedly patrolled the aisle pointing out protesters to police for removal.Leave aside the police’s appalling complicity . . . though what WERE they thinking? Here was the future Labour leader, reportedly singling out an 80-year-old Holocaust survivor for expulsion for holding views he disliked.For three years  Corbyn’s vile beliefs and associations have shocked Britain.This new outrage, though, must surely be the last straw for self-respecting Labour members who haven’t already quit.TOMMY Robinson is a nasty thug and a grandstanding idiot.He is not a freedom fighter. Nor is he  the hero he is made out to be in the sewer which social media has become.Nor is he a “reporter” fearlessly exposing an establishment cover-up of rapes by gangs of Asian men. That scandal has been exposed by actual journalists.In fact Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, almost wrecked the trial of some accused of serious crime, thus potentially denying both them and their alleged victims justice.Yesterday he was freed on appeal over his contempt of court. Supporters say he was locked up too hastily and for too long. But he was already serving a suspended sentence for the same offence.His many convictions stretch from violence to fraud. We have no sympathy.The case he jeopardised in Leeds had reporting restrictions, temporarily preventing details being publicised. They’re neither unusual nor a politically-correct cover-up. They’re to avoid prejudicing and collapsing other trials linked to it.Robinson blatantly flouted them, was in contempt — and admitted it.Yes, our legal system IS too secretive. On this occasion it was crucial in the interests of justice.It’s time his supporters grasped it.WHAT a surprise. Remember  the scare story that Brexit would kill 200,000 City jobs?Now the City of London Corporation forecast is 5,000. Even they may not happen.

Available only to the elite few who could afford them at first, they were designed purely to enable people to take a call while away from home.Fast forward a couple of decades and we are all glued to our devices, a nation of addicts.We are now so wedded to our smartphones that we check them every 12 minutes.The average Brit spends more than a day a week online, twice as long as ten years ago.This surge in time online is largely down to the rise of smartphones, which are now used by 78 per cent of the population compared with just 17 per cent in 2008.My personal bugbear is people who walk along the street in a slow zig-zag because they are glued to their phone.And there’s nothing worse than someone who interrupts a conversation to take a call or read a text.It surely can’t be a coincidence that, in the same week as this report was released, we hear about five-year-olds starting school unable to speak in sentences — partly, no doubt, down to parents plugging them into a screen rather than talking or reading to them.I’ve got a Blackberry, mainly because I like the keyboard. But I am probably as hooked on it as the next person.It’s an invaluable tool for anyone wanting to work flexibly. But I also do a fair amount of pointless surfing on it.I’m not into all forms of social media, but I am a bit of a news junkie and I’ll confess I also watch the odd funny YouTube film with my kids.Unfortunately, progress in technology has brought the idea that we “should” all be available 24/7.In fact, people are quite indignant if you don’t reply to an email within the hour — even if it’s sent at 4am.Being a conscientious type, the result for me if I’m not careful, is that if I wake up in the night I’ll check my emails and maybe even reply to a few before going back to sleep. Now that can’t be good for the old circadian rhythms.The other problem with everyone being always available and always “on” is that our FOMO — fear of missing out — has increased exponentially.We’re all terrified that if we’re offline for too long we won’t get to . . . what exactly? See photos of someone’s hashtag perfect holibobs with the famalam — and then feel like our life is rubbish by comparison?I use Twitter a bit but I avoid Facebook and Instagram, partly because I don’t want the possibility that the opinions and “likes” of people I don’t know may influence me more than my own values and views.And another problem with the prevalence of tech is that we don’t have any down time.All those previously blank moments — on the bus, waiting for our microwave meal to cook, lying in bed at night — have all become an opportunity to surf, tweet, and message. We are going to burn out if we aren’t careful.I always know when I’m really relaxed because I accidentally go out without my phone.Granted, it generally only happens when I’m on holiday.But now I know how close we are to becoming actual addicts, I feel like we should all build in some time away from our devices.After all, the more time we spend looking at a screen, the less time we spend looking at the world and engaging with other people.So maybe we should all take a moment to leave our phone at home, go for a walk, and switch from “on” to “off”.Isn’t that a liberating thought?I’M sure a fair few people felt a bit guilty reading about the Vogue interview with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie this week.The sisters talk about how hard it is living in the public eye but also the criticism and mockery they face, often attacked for taking too many holidays.Who knows, perhaps some of that criticism is justified.But a lot of the comments they get are about their appearance and clothes – and that is where it crosses a line.No-one chooses the family into which they are born, and they are trying to make the best of the hand they’ve been given.They are trying to build careers and have a personal life while being in the public eye and that can’t be easy.I hope people realise that and give them a break.HAVING spent the past couple of decades getting annoyed at anyone who utters the words “Poor Jennifer Aniston”, this week, for the first time ever, I said them myself.You know why?Because the 49-year-old has been forced to publicly address, again, the tedious topic of why she hasn’t had a baby.She also alluded to something no woman should have to share with anyone they don’t want to, let alone the world – the fact she might be medically unable to procreate.Poor Jen. She can’t just get on with her very successful – and no doubt happy – life without being plagued by speculation.In the same interview she took the chance to spell it out: Just because she split from Justin Theroux doesn’t mean her life is over.She might even be happy to have finally got shot of him.“The misconceptions are ‘Jen can’t keep a man’,” she said. “And ‘Jen refuses to have a baby because she’s selfish and committed to her career.’ Or that I’m sad and heartbroken . . . first, with all due respect, I’m not heartbroken. And second, those are reckless assumptions.“No one knows what’s going on behind closed doors. No one considers how sensitive that might be for my partner and me. They don’t know what I’ve been through medically or emotionally.“There is a pressure on women to be mothers, and if they are not, then they’re deemed damaged goods. Maybe my purpose on this planet isn’t to procreate. Maybe I have other things I’m supposed to do.”So yes. Poor, poor Jen being under the world’s watchful and pitying eye all the time.Just to remind people. Jennifer Aniston is one of the world’s most successful stars.She has a big group of friends and a beautiful home, which she bought herself. She has dogs she adores, she’s funny, busy, and fulfilled.But all of that is worth nothing, of course. She doesn’t have kids.To anyone reading this who thinks women must have children to be fulfilled, please take note: Plenty of women don’t want to get married or have kids.Many other women want kids but can’t have them.And guess what? It’s none of our business.Here’s another way of looking at Jennifer’s life. She is lucky.She gets to please herself and hasn’t had to make any of the sacrifices that many of us make to become mothers.Also, George Clooney didn’t meet Amal until he was 51. Hugh Grant got married this year at 57 (after many failed relationships). Leonardo DiCaprio, 43, and Jude Law, 45, are still single and dating. Has anyone ever said: “Poor George/Hugh/Leonardo/Jude”?Of course they haven’t. So let’s stop saying it about Jennifer, too.I SO related to Carol Vorderman’s delight at being asked for proof of age when she bought some wine at M\u0026ampS recently.When you’re young, being asked to prove your age, as the presenter, above, was is very annoying. But as time goes by it’s one of life’s little victories.Having said that, this hasn’t happened to me in Aldi. Maybe I ought to go to M\u0026ampS!I’M truly appalled by the news that the Home Office “turns a blind eye” to the plight of British teenagers who are being forced to marry abroad, then raped and impregnated – after which the ministerial department actually hands a visa to their husbands.These young British women in question are forced abroad, or told they are going on holiday, but in reality are forced into a marriage and to get pregnant so that they can apply for a UK visa for their “husband”.Officials received dozens of reports last year that women wanted to block visas for men they had been made to marry in countries including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and the United Arab Emirates.But in almost half of their cases the visas were approved nonetheless! And experts believe that there are thousands more victims who are too afraid to come forward.The women forced into this situation must be absolutely terrified, not least because their own family is complicit in this abuse.The authorities when granting the visa do not actually speak to the “wife”. There is no whistle-blowing process or opportunity for the women to make a confidential statement. Any statement made is public.Authorities fear that if they block the visa they will be called racists, but this is a safeguarding issue and that fear of causing offence really has to stop.We need to get on top of the problem by working with schools to raise awareness, so girls know how to report it.And we need to work with social workers so they can recognise the family members are the perpetrators of this crime.GOSH, how shocking is the video footage of a woman called Arabella Juniper Torres calling the police to report a woman, who happened to be black, for sheltering in her doorway in Brooklyn, New York, while waiting for her Uber?We are living in the age of the death of the Good Samaritan.I helped someone carry a pushchair downstairs at the Tube last week – as all the burly men walked past, I might add.She was so grateful it made me realise small acts of kindness have all but disappeared. How about this for an idea: let’s all try to be kind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And how did they get so sick that they believe their behaviour is socially acceptable?These women-hating bullies — Liam Holmes, 20, who battered a woman to the ground outside Faces nightclub, and the five smirking thugs who tormented a vulnerable woman but can’t be named because they are under 18 — are not the products of brutal, inner-city gangland.These blights on the face of British manhood are the product of ordinary homes, God help us.They are what our young men look like now.They are not feral kids who never had a chance.They are not the products of deprived lives.The leering bullies posing proudly around their terrified victim in that sun-drenched park are growing up in Bury St Edmunds, a peaceful Suffolk market town with pretty cottages and a lovely cathedral, while Liam Holmes attacked his victim outside a club that was once a fashionable oasis for footballers and pop stars, the Essex answer to New York’s Studio 54.These thugs all have dear old mums who love them to bits.Indeed, the mother of one of the park scum sacks — a woman who must have an IQ lower than her dress size — complained that her son was the one suffering now because the backlash has ruined his 16th birthday.The poor little lamb! What’s the world coming to if you and your mates can’t torture a vulnerable middle-aged woman in the park any more?Personally, I hope the backlash ruins his life.And while we ponder these pitiful excuses for young men, let us spare a thought for their female victims.The 18-year-old woman who was punched to the ground by Liam Holmes has been predictably abused in the sewer of social media, informed “she deserved it” for daring to speak back to a man, and gloatingly told that, “she had a lesson in true equality.Meanwhile the vulnerable 49-year-old woman who was brutalised in the park has spoken with incredible restraint about her experience, which must have been as humiliating as it was frightening.“Considering the respective ages of all parties and that it was five or six young men versus me alone, I remain surprised that they behaved in such a way towards me,” she said.“I would like to hear their reasons, if possible.”Which is so mild-mannered that I find it breaks my bloody heart.It is tempting to blame the surge in violence against women on social media, and brainless morons like the little d**ks in that park taking pictures to show off to their mates. But it can’t all be blamed on social media.I bet Liam Holmes wishes there were no cameras around when he was smashing a woman in the jaw.“He wouldn’t do that for no reason,” protests his mother Cathy, 53. “There was a lot that went on before that people don’t know about.”Sorry, there can never be an excuse, reason or justification for a man or boy to abuse a woman or girl. Not ever.The old taboo about men being violent towards women should still stand.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they say something cutting to you at chucking out time.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they have the insolent cheek to sit on the park bench where you like to hang out with your bad-ass homies in the Bury St Edmunds massive.How hard is it to understand?Men should not be violent towards women.My father, the hardest man I ever met, taught me a real man does not raise his voice to a woman, let alone his hand.But that generation of tough, gentle men has gone and in their place we have pitiful excuses for the male of the species who feel empowered by belittling, beating and abusing women.And what sickens the stomach about the boys in the park is that they all look so very pleased with themselves, as if tormenting a vulnerable woman who, in the words of her stepmother “wouldn’t say boo to a goose” is the high point of their miserable lives.It is a good job their mothers all love them because I can’t imagine any other self-respecting woman ever will.“He’s never had a girlfriend,” someone remarked of woman-bashing lout, Liam Holmes.Yes, it shows. The big close-up Nicole posted on Instagram is absolutely terrifying. What a scary face! The spider, I mean. Not Nicole.HOW sweet life was for Jeremy Corbyn when he was a loopy left-wing backbencher, free to flutter his eyelashes at the IRA, to stand on platforms that compared Israel to Nazi Germany and to bowl up on Iranian TV praising the release of Hamas terrorists who had murdered Jewish children.But now fate has Corbyn as a possible Prime Minister his support of extremism is not such a good look.And no matter how pathetic this Tory Government becomes, no matter how timid, weak and gutless Theresa May looks in the face of Brussels’ bullying, the British people will never choose for Prime Minister a man who considers the child killers in Hamas to be his “brothers”.“In the past, in the pursuit of peace and justice for the Palestinian people, I have on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject,” apologises panicky Corbyn, a man who can feel the keys to 10 Downing Street slipping through his fingers.The past is coming back to haunt Jeremy Corbyn.And it will destroy him.It might also have something to do with the celeb fear of looking like a sweaty idiot with two left feet, while wearing nipple-crushing Lycra on prime-time television.Luckily, Nadiya Bychkova, above, will be there for her second series, the only pro dancer who looks more like a celebrity than any of the celebrities.THOSE who want the UK to remain in the European Union have never made any attempt to persuade the 17.4million who voted to leave to change our minds.They just insult us.Peter Mandelson says Brexiteers “hate other countries and hate foreigners” while Stewart Lee, a pot-bellied Bernard Manning for snowflakes, says: “It wasn’t just racists that voted to leave Europe – c**** did as well. Stupid f****** c****.”Just insults.Which is why Remain lost the referendum. And why they would lose 100 referendums.BAKE Off winner Nadiya Hussain tells Loose Women: “I work in an industry that is heavily dominated by male, middle-class, middle-aged men and there’s no space for a 5ft brown girl, who wears a headscarf.”But you became a national treasure, Nadiya.So self-pity is misplaced.MADONNA turns 60 years old on August 16 and has marked the birthday by laying provocatively on the ground sporting suspenders, lacy bra and a been-to-bed expression in her half-closed eyes.The Material Girl still looks great, of course.Mind you, she does look as though she might need a hand getting back on her feet. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We believe that by making these changes, we can save as many as 700 more lives every year.“But organ donation remains a gift.

A lot, actually. The Chequers deal has bombed with Tory MPs and activists, including members of the PM\u0027s own association in Maidenhead.Two senior cabinet ministers, David Davis and Boris Johnson, have resigned, with Mr Davis\u0027s former lieutenants Steve Baker and Stewart Jackson now acting as pro-Brexit attack dogs.Mr Johnson, meanwhile, is now firmly re-installed as the darling of the Tory grassroots and the hot favourite with the activists to replace Mrs May as party leader and prime minister.Then there has been the reaction to the Chequers deal from Michel Barnier, accused by Dr Fox in his Sunday Times interview of \"intransigence\" and of making no deal more likely. In his lofty, patrician manner and with customary \"hauteur\", Mr Barnier picked the Chequers plan apart clause by clause, to the extent that even its biggest fans fear it is now mort dans l\u0027eau.And that\u0027s one reason why Theresa May was probably wasting her time when she went to the French president\u0027s Riviera retreat and told him Brussels faces a choice between the Chequers deal and no deal.When I went to Strasbourg for Emmanuel Macron\u0027s address to the European Parliament in April, I was told by senior MEPs that the president and Mr Barnier are extremely close politically.As a result, President Macron - probably the EU\u0027s chief powerbroker now that Angela Merkel\u0027s authority is waning - will ensure that his \"uncle\" succeeds Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission next year.No wonder President Macron told Mrs May at Napoleon\u0027s stronghold of Fort Bregancon that he was not willing to break the Brexit deadlock by breaking ranks with the EU\u0027s negotiators.\"There is absolutely no intention to speak in place of Monsieur Barnier,\" a French diplomat was reported to have said, confirming the president\u0027s close alignment with Mr Barnier.And so in spite of Mrs May\u0027s Riviera charm offensive, there has at the same time been a significant change in tone in the government\u0027s Brexit language in recent weeks, as the Chequers plan has faced derision and rejection. First there has been what Brexiteers claim has been a return of \"project fear\" scare stories, about stockpiling of food and medicines, lorry gridlock at Dover, long queues at border control and customs and fees for travel visas.But the biggest change in tone has come in the Foreign Office, where Boris Johnson\u0027s clown-like bluster and looseness with facts and detail have been replaced by the more thoughtful approach of Jeremy Hunt.Instead of Mr Johnson\u0027s gung-ho and cavalier approach to Brexit, former Remainer Mr Hunt has been deadly serious in his warnings of the risk of \"no deal by accident\" increasing by the day.Then last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney - denounced as \"the high priest of Project Fear\" by Jacob Rees-Mogg - said the risk of no deal was \"uncomfortably high and highly undesirable\".Are all these dire warnings aimed at putting pressure on Brussels to sign up to a deal? Almost certainly. Will they work? Probably not. But then some hardline Brexiteers on the Tory backbenches have always favoured no deal.The danger for the prime minister, however, is that the more no deal looks likely the louder the calls from pro-Remain MPs and campaigners for a second referendum - a so-called \"people\u0027s vote\" - will become."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-thames-appeal-man-rescued_4381113.jpg?20180805082051 ","title":"mystery after man with dragon tattoo is plucked from thames","story":"He was wearing a camouflage T-shirt with \"Now or never, no regrets, past/present/future\" written on it.Scotland Yard added: \"He has two distinctive tattoos on his left hand and one on his lower right leg that are faded black in colour.\"The tattoo on the leg appears to be \"tribal\", while the one on his hand resembles a dragon.The London Ambulance Service was alerted at around 7.20pm on the night of the rescue by reports of a man in the Thames, police said.Detective Sergeant Samantha Batchelor said: \"We have exhausted all our lines of enquiry to identify this man and we are hoping with the release of his image a friend or family member will be able to come forward to tell us who he is.\"The picture showed a brown-haired man using breathing apparatus in a hospital bed."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/c7026a2153b49790aa3832fbddcc388923a04ca3378fa6855dc36793300ce0ec_4381496.jpg?20180805170948 ","title":"nasas curiosity rover sings happy birthday to itself on mars","story":"Curiosity has set the ground for NASA\u0027s new Mars 2020 mission, although a recent study sponsored by NASA has suggested that dreams of transforming the planet into a habitable long-term human colony are scientifically impossible with current technology.Life in some form may already exist there, however, as a large, stable mass of liquid water has been detected beneath the planet\u0027s southern ice cap.Salts in the lake are believed to have kept the water - which has a temperature as low as -68C (-90F) - from freezing over."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-live-donor-maude-vt_4381023.jpg?20180805014857 ","title":"organ donation changes could save 700 more lives a year","story":"The news has been welcomed by health charities, who say it will only be effective if it\u0027s part of a wider strategy to tackle to donor shortage."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-katie-spencer-portugal_4380149.jpg?20180804103658 ","title":"portuguese city evora like a ghost town as it bakes in europe heatwave","story":"Going out from midday onwards is almost unbearable.Hardy holidaymakers that have made their way here, determined to get their money\u0027s worth from their break, have been told to look at what the locals are doing."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-pigeon-snake-leytonstone_4381077.jpg?20180805063402 ","title":"python eats pigeon on east london street","story":"RSPCA inspector Rebecca Bedson said: \"I\u0027m very keen to find out how he came to be in such a dangerous situation."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-theresa-may-emmanuel-macron_4379773.jpg?20180803185908 ","title":"theresa may meets emmanuel macron to find way through brexit impasse","story":"The EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier put it in black and white on the eve of the fortress meeting.He wrote in an opinion piece in a number of European newspapers: \"Some UK proposals would undermine our single market which is one of the EU\u0027s biggest achievements.\"The UK wants to keep free movement of goods between us, but not of people and services.\"It followed a number of occasions these past two weeks when he has knocked down a central pillar of the Chequers proposal, which he sees as an attempt by the UK to cut through the \"indivisible\" four freedoms - the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.So depending on which way you look at it, Mrs May is either here for this meeting to divide and rule to go over the head of Mr Barnier and appeal to the EU member countries leaders directly.Or this is simply one of a number of important opportunities to talk through Chequers in detail, face-to-face, eye-to-eye with a key EU leader.The UK and France are pivotal players in a very uncertain world at the moment.With that in mind both leaders will want to find a way through this impasse. But there is a key question at the heart of the EU side\u0027s thinking on Brexit. Don\u0027t forget they deeply regret Britain\u0027s departure and are aware it presents dangers, whatever happens.The question is this: what\u0027s the best or the least bad Brexit for the EU\u0027s medium and long term interests?Is it to give the UK a good deal - thus breaking principles of the EU, allowing Britain free movement of goods but not people unique bespoke deal, as outlined in Chequers?

The International Trade Secretary rates the chances of a no-deal Brexit at 60-40, even though both sides say they want to reach an agreement on the terms ahead of the UK\u0027s departure in March 2019. Prominent Brexiteer Dr Fox has heaped the blame on Europe\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Brussels\u0027 unwillingness to compromise which he branded intransigence - while at the same time holding firm to his own Government\u0027s stated plan. I think the intransigence of the commission is pushing us towards no deal, he told the Sunday Times.  We have set out the basis in which a deal can happen but if the EU decides that the theological obsession of the unelected is to take priority over the economic wellbeing of the people of Europe then it\u0027s a bureaucrats\u0027 Brexit - not a people\u0027s Brexit - then there is only going to be one outcome.  He said Mr Barnier had dismissed the UK\u0027s proposals in the Chequers plan thrashed out by Theresa May and the Cabinet simply because we have never done it before.  The Government has admitted its proposals are unprecedented, but Dr Fox said Mr Barnier\u0027s response makes the chance of no deal greater. The Prime Minister held talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, cutting short her holiday to visit his summer retreat.  And ministers including Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab have also engaged in diplomatic activity in Europe in recent days as the Government seeks to deal directly with individual governments in an effort to keep the Chequers plan alive. In a sign that member states are being warned of the consequences of the failure to find a deal, Dr Fox said: It\u0027s up to the EU27 to determine whether they want the EU Commission\u0027s ideological purity to be maintained at the expense of their real economies. Meanwhile, former cabinet minister Priti Patel said Mrs May must ditch the Chequers plan, which would see a common rulebook for goods with the EU - effectively tying the UK to terms set by Brussels. Writing for the  website she said it did not meet the result of the referendum and will leave us half-in and half-out, still bound to EU regulations and constraints.

And the Lanigan family claim its because they are 100 per cent medicine-free.  Antibiotics, painkillers, immunisations and even Calpol are banned by parents Richard and Janette. They even kept one baby out of hospital when doctors told them she was likely to die from whooping cough – and claim the natural nutrients in breast milk kept her alive. Sisters Molly and Isabelle, 14, and Eloise, 11, have never taken part in national immunisation programmes. So they haven’t had jabs for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, haemophilus influenzae, hepatitis B, rotavirus, meningitis B, measles, mumps or rubella. In fact they’ve never even had a Lemsip!  And former chiropractor Richard, 61, insists more families should follow their example. “The evidence clearly demonstrates you can strengthen children’s immune systems by letting them play in the dirt and get infections,” he says. “If my kids’ bread dropped on the floor I’d pick it up and put it back in their mouths. “I strengthen my girls’ immune systems by allowing them to get diseases. “They have less time off than other kids at their school, but that’s not because of one particular thing – it’s a way of life.” He adds: “If you look at how we evolved, humans got stronger by getting illnesses. “The process of natural selection meant the strongest survived. By getting ill it makes us stronger. Natural selection means survival of the fittest – it’s harsh but true.”  If the girls are in pain at the family home in Thames Ditton, Surrey, the strongest treatment Dad prescribes is ice... or maybe a flat Cola because he believes the acid kills bad tummy bacteria. “Ice is the most effective anti-inflammatory and pain relief but there’s no money for the pharmaceutical industry in frozen water so they encourage people to take drugs.” Richard insists: “I am not anti-drugs. You definitely need them in some cases. “But anything in excess damages health. I must be doing something right because it’s unusual to have children who have never needed antibiotics.” And he adds: “If my girls got hit by a bus they’d go to A\u0026ampE – that’s what emergency medicine is good at. “But they’re not so good at healthcare. If they were, we wouldn’t have the rise in autoimmune disorders and chronic illnesses like Type 2 diabetes.”  Though daughter Isabelle had chickenpox as a youngster, the first time any of his kids had painkillers was when Eloise hit her head aged seven and went to A\u0026ampE. Two nurses had to pin her down to give her Calpol because she didn’t know what it was and was so horrified she spat it out. Asked by medical staff if his daughter was allergic to antibiotics, Richard had to admit he had no idea – because she’d never had any. “The nurses were looking at me like a new age freak,” he recalls. “They couldn’t believe that she had never had antibiotics by that age.” Richard even claims he treated his own rectal cancer with cannabis oil after refusing modern treatments and survived despite being given just months to live. He questioned Britain’s reliance on vaccinations after doing a masters in health promotion in 2004.

Despite a healthy appetite the 11-year-old cannot put weight on his upper body. And he has been a target for cruel bullies who call him an alien, skinny or a freak. But courageous Shaun today insists: “I want people to realise I’m normal and they shouldn’t judge others by the way they look. “If people bully me or stare too much I try to act like I don’t care but it upsets me because it’s not my fault I have this.” Shaun’s condition at first baffled doctors – but after two years they diagnosed “ultra-rare” acquired partial lipodystrophy.  It means his body has a \u0026shyproblem making, using and storing fat. There are only 700 sufferers in the UK. Their life expectancy can be lower because of the risk of diabetes and kidney problems. Shaun is also one of few who don’t develop the illness at birth. It struck after his third birthday. And it’s rare for it to affect only the upper half of the body. “Having lipodystrophy makes me unique and special,” said Shaun. “But it’s bad because it stops me doing things like swimming as I’m worried about what people think about how I look.  “I love swimming but sometimes it makes me not want to go because so many people stare. “It’s also bad because of how I look and what it can do inside my body. “Because I’m so skinny my skin hurts sometimes, if it’s really hot or really cold outside.” Parents Joanne, 46, and Brian, 48, felt helpless as their little boy got thinner. Joanne said: “Shaun was bonny when he was born – \u0026shyperfect in every way. “We couldn’t believe what we were seeing. It was like I closed my eyes and my little boy had turned into an old man overnight. Suddenly he was more like a 70-year-old.  “It’s still a mystery how Shaun got \u0026shylipodystrophy. No one else in our family ever had it. They think it was viral but can’t pinpoint an exact virus or cause.” One clue is that he had chronic constipation as a baby and needed a stoma tube in his abdomen. “At every appointment I still ask doctors if there is a cure,” said Joanne. “They just say, ‘One day, we hope.’” Despite looking gaunt, Shaun is always hungry because without fat cells his body produces less of the \u0026shyhormone leptin, which tells the brain the body has had enough to eat.  Joanne said: “He’s been called things like alien, skinny or freak by children who don’t know better. “I get \u0026shystrangers \u0026shytelling me I need to feed my child, like they think I would starve him. “We went in to a shop when he was younger and the shopkeeper barked, ‘He needs feeding up, doesn’t he?’ Once a dentist cleared the room to ask me if he was anorexic. I laughed. If only he knew how much Shaun eats!” "},{"url":null,"title":"daisy jenks marries charlie van","story":"NewsDaisy Jenks marries Charlie van Straubenzee in flower-embellished wedding dress - and of course her bridal bouquet features daisiesPrince Harry was best man and Meghan Markle were both guests of the couple with van Straubenzee a childhood friend of the Duke of SussexShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter18:17, 4 AUG 2018Updated19:19, 4 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Childhood friend of Prince Harry Charlie van Straubenzee has married Daisy Jenks with the royal serving as his best man for the big day.   Bride Daisy wore a flower-embellished wedding dress for the 3.30pm service at St Mary the Virgin church in Frensham, Surrey.  And the bridal bouquet for the party and wedding videographer, of course, had to include her namesake flowers. On one of the hottest days of the year the guests were all smiles as they waited outside the church in the glorious sunshine. There was no page boys on hand to help the bride with her veil or train but she did have a troupe of young bridesmaids to offer their services should they be required.  After the ceremony, which lasted roughly 45 minutes, Charlie performed his first duty as a newlywed husband - cycling his bride off to the reception in a tricycle. Daisy, who arrived in a black 1951 Mk6 Bentley just before 3.30pm, chose the church, which was consecrated in 1239, as it was where her parents Phillip and Dixie got married and also where she was baptised. Revd Jane Walker, who led the service, said: “It was a wonderful occasion and Charlie and Daisy looked spectacularly happy. It was a great occasion.” Bride Daisy kicked off her career in 2010 when she was hired to film a wedding in Port Isaac. She is said to have gone full-time in 2011 and now has clients in Europe as well as the UK. The groom had been usher at the Duke and Duchess\u0027 wedding in Windsor in May and paid Harry the ultimate compliment by choosing him to be best man for the nuptials today. The royal connections for the happy couple run deep with his older brother Thomas being good friends with the Duke of Cambridge and also godfather to Princess Charlotte. A third Van Straubenzee brother died in 2002 aged 18 with both princes attending the funeral.

But viewers will see the founder of rival Poundland left reeling by the state of the business, owned by millionaire Aziz Tayub. In a new fly-on-the-wall Channel 4 series, Yorkshire entrepreneur Edwards, 67, finds staff stealing and workers fiddling clocking-off times. On a visit to one “boring” store he moans: “It’s a grotty old place.

Poundstretcher has lost its way on the obvious. And until the distribution is right, we are b****cksed.

He sees workers stealing on CCTV. “It amazes me we don’t search them at the end of a shift,” Mark tells the documentary makers. “To me, that’s a given.” The Tayub family – who saw a \u0026pound3.4million profit turn into a \u0026pound3.5million loss in 2017 – wanted to draw on Chris’s expertise after he sold Poundworld for \u0026pound150million in 2015.

Dom Mee, 47, spent years in the Royal Marines after leaving school but struggled to adjust to civilian life on his return.  So he teamed up with former colleagues to set up Protection Vessels International Ltd, a maritime security firm which escorts super-yachts through dangerous waters.  And, after he procured an 80ft Swedish gun boat, Dom and his mates decided to embark down the Gulf of Aden into the vast Indian Ocean for one of their toughest challenges, Wales Online says.   I was annoyed at what was happening in that region — boats were being hijacked and massive amounts of ransom paid out, as was the official protocol in such situations. We were proud ex-Marines and wanted to make a difference, the father-of-three said. Somali pirates earned hundreds of millions of dollars from hijackings during their peaks of activity between 2008 and 2012. And Dom, who had grown up near rural Denbigh, north Wales, wanted to tackle this head on. He added: The EU Navy’s directive was catch and release — meaning that if they apprehended hijackers all they’d do is confiscate their weapons and send them on their way, giving them enough fuel to get home. That’s like two guys doing a drive-by shooting in Pontypridd and the police taking their guns, slapping their wrist and gifting them a McDonald’s voucher each.  We got called cowboys by some, but nothing could be further from the truth. Far from inflaming the piracy problem, our involvement was tackling it head on — and not a moment too soon, as organised crime syndicates from the mainland were starting to get involved as there was clearly a lot of money to be made. Whenever a ship approached us we’d fire a flare to say we’d seen them — and if they kept coming after that we’d let off a few warning shots. We’d use tracer bullets that lit up red when fired, so there was no doubt about whether they’d clocked them or not. And, if they continued to proceed toward us after that, then it was probably safe to assume they weren\u0027t collecting for the Red Cross. Mohamed Abdi Hassan, aka Big Mouth, was a Somali entrepreneur and diplomat who bankrolled a pirate fleet from behind the scenes. He was on board a ship. Meanwhile, Mohamed Abdi Garaad, a former fisherman-turned-hijacker who served as Hassan’s attack dog and became Dom’s seafaring nemesis, was also masterminding the hijackings. And Garaad was behind Dom\u0027s closest shave, a night-time raid on a ship he was guarding where a rocket-propelled grenade was fired into the funnel stack, almost blowing up some of his team.  Dom, who now has three children, continued: Their mothership had been sunk by the Russians so they didn’t have enough fuel to get back – so for them it was hijack or die. But he managed to get both a spotlight and his gun\u0027s sights fixed on the raiders just as they attached their ladder to the side of his vessel. He was an elusive guy, but when he hijacked a UK ship called Asian Glory off the Horn of Africa in 2010, the plan was for me to go on board to drop off the money and get photographic proof the hostages were still alive,” added Dom. “More importantly, I just wanted to look him in the eye, you know see the man in the flesh finally. “However, Garaad’s pirate enclave was hit by Islamic militants shortly before the drop was due to happen and everyone got really freaked out. “As a result the money got delivered by air instead, so as to avoid any potential fire fights. In the case of Big Mouth, though, he was undone by his own ego. “Interpol set up a fake film production company and told him they wanted to make a documentary about his life. So he flew to Belgium to meet them in 2013 and – BOOM! He’s still in jail there as we speak.  And it was after Garaad’s departure that Dom decided to quit the armed escort game. “That was a big moment for me, the war felt over,” he says, adding that he\u0027s relocated to Sri Lanka, where he embarked on the new adventure of being dad to three young children, as well as renting out a number of luxury coastal villas to visiting tourists. Although, as he admits, the buzz of that former life of daring will never leave him completely. For now, I have a simple life and it\u0027s the first time in a long time I\u0027ve felt like a civilian. It\u0027s kind of nice to be normal again.

With so many choices out there, it can be overwhelming.  Earlier this year we found out what the most popular baby names of 2018 so far were.  Olivia and Mohammed took the top spots once again. But it seems certain names are proving less popular than others and experts believe some of them could become extinct.  Bounty have just revealed the top 20 names for boys and girls which are falling in favour - and one of them belongs to a Kardashian sister.   Here\u0027s a look at the most unpopular baby names of 2018 - is your child\u0027s name on the list? Girls\u0027 Names   Cecelia   Bridie   Bonny   Cecily   Mimi   Aubrie   Mika   Roxanne   Alora   Kourtney    A spokesman for Bounty said: Classically traditional ‘old lady’ names Cecelia and Cecily are on their way to becoming extinct this year if not revived along with Sandra  which admittedly not be an obvious one to revive without their being a strong and meaningful family connection to the name.   Even with popularity of the Kardashians today, the name Kourtney is heading for extinction alongside Mimi and Bonny.  Boys\u0027 Names    Jago   Macauley   Leroy   Guy   Fabio   Soren   Arnold   Carl   Ivor   Marcos   Back in the day ‘Home Alone’ child star Macauley Culkin inspired lots of parents to choose the name Macauley for their little boys, but as the little star grew up the name has dropped in favour and is set to become extinct this year, say Bounty.  They added: Given the traditional ‘old man’ names popular with parents today, it’s worth noting Arnold is also in need of revival. Carl, Leroy and Guy are also set to disappear if not rejuvenated soon. Once considered unusual, even trendy ‘o’ sounding names are set for extinction this year. So how about saving Soren or Jago from fading away. Opting for one of these unpopular names could be a good way to help your child stand out from the crowd.

Experts who polled 1,000 dog and cat owners over the age of 55, and 1,000 adults of the same age without a pet, found those with canine and feline companionships were TWICE as likely to consider themselves a success. And those with a pet are lucky enough to bring home almost \u0026pound4,000 more a year than those without. In addition, pet owners are more likely to be married, have a child, bag themselves a University degree and have found their perfect job. Pet owners also do almost double the amount of exercise – raising their heart-rate five times a week compared to just three times for non-pet owners. So it\u0027s perhaps unsurprising that nine in 10 owners believe their pet is good for their health and wellbeing.   A spokesperson for the UK’s leading retirement housebuilder, McCarthy \u0026amp Stone , said: “These findings back up our view that pet ownership can have many positive benefits for the over 55s.  “At McCarthy \u0026amp Stone, we understand the importance of this relationship all too well. Questions about our pet-friendly policy are always top of the list for pet owners who are considering downsizing. And it is our pleasure to explain that well-behaved pets are welcome in all of our developments, so homeowners can enjoy all of these advantages during their retirement years.” The study revealed owners of cats and dogs are more likely to volunteer for a charity, and go on a dream holiday. But those without pets are more likely to have paid off their mortgage (69% compared to 60%) and retire earlier (46% compared to 35 per cent). Researchers also found pets bring laughter to six in 10 owners, and seven in 10 feel more relaxed in their company.  While 43% value their dog or cat as it means they always have someone to talk to, 16% went as far as to say that if it wasn’t for their pet, they wouldn’t ever speak to anyone.  And half of those polled, through OnePoll , admit they never feel lonely due to having a pet, while the same percentage always look forward to getting home to see them.  For 45%, their pet is the main reason they exercise and another 31% claim that having a pet gives them a purpose in life. Psychologist and author, Corinne Sweet, said: “The psychological and emotional benefits of pet ownership are well-known among mental health professionals. Having a close bond with a domestic animal can boost ‘feel good’ biochemicals such as endorphins and oxytocin which can make owners feel more relaxed, calmer and happier at home.

It is thought Met Police counter terror cops are investigating the likelihood that the assassins smuggled the components to the nerve agent into the country then mixed it in a public toilet in Salisbury.  Dawn Sturgess, 44, died on July 8 after she was given a sealed box containing a Novichok-filled perfume bottle. Boyfriend Charlie Rowley, 45, found it in the park on June 29 and gave it to her as a gift. Forensic teams have discovered low-level contamination in toilets in the city\u0027s Queen Elizabeth Gardens.   A source told The Sun : “Novichok is a liquid agent made of two components.  “The toilets in Queen Elizabeth Gardens are a key location where it could have been mixed, prepared or dumped. “It’s chilling and definitely a line of inquiry.” Ex-spy Sergei, 67, and daughter Yulia Skripal, 33, fell critically ill on March 3 after they touched Novichok that had been smeared on their front door handle.  Both managed to survive. Sergei has not been seen in public since the assassination attempt - which Russia has strenuously denied any involvement in. A spokesman for the politan Police told the paper said: “The investigation is ongoing. We are not prepared to discuss any lines of inquiry.” Last month Ms Sturgess was laid to rest. Mr Rowley attended the service which began with the James Blunt song \u0027Beautiful Dawn\u0027.

And the revelation explodes the vile lies of racist groups who have tried to exploit the vulnerable young victims in a bid to stir up hatred and fear. Because the Sunday Mirror investigation which exposed the town’s child sex scandal has uncovered a raft of Asian victims – who have kept quiet to save their families being shunned. One said of the exploitation of the scandal by far-right racists: “It makes me feel girls like me don’t matter, that we haven’t suffered too.” Experts now say the true scale of the crime, uncovered by this paper four months ago, may never be known – and that the girls’ silence could help some perpetrators to evade justice. We revealed in March how up to 1,000 victims may have been groomed in the Shropshire town during a horrifying 40-year campaign of abuse. Five deaths were linked to the shocking epidemic, including the mother and sister of one of the girls, killed alongside her in an arson attack.  Until now, the abuse victims had been understood to be almost entirely white girls preyed on by Asian gangs. But we have spoken to a number from both Indian and Pakistani backgrounds who were also targeted. Some said they still cannot bring themselves to talk to police because they fear judgment and retribution. One, the daughter of Pakistani immigrants, told us: “The first time I was raped, I was only 11. I didn’t even know what sex was. “I went from being an angel child to staying in bed, wanting to die. “I’ve still never told my family. If I did, my dad wouldn’t be able to show his face in the mosque. “It doesn’t just happen to white girls, it happens to us too.”  Child abuse campaigners fear the horror is being exploited by far-right groups for their own ends. A string of extremist marches have been held in the town since our 18-month probe exposed the scandal. Holly Archer, who led a campaign for a public inquiry, said: “We’re sick of our ordeals being exploited by far-right groups who don’t care about us, but about their own racist agenda. “I’ve spoken to several girls from Asian communities who have felt unable to come forward. Children from all backgrounds can be sexually exploited, but those from ethnic minorities are far less likely to tell anyone. It’s time to stand together and show they will be supported.” Ansar Ali, of Together Against Grooming, has said there could be scores more victims. His campaign group works with Asian communities across Britain to raise awareness of child sexual exploitation. He said: “It’s no surprise to hear there are Asian victims in Telford.  “Research has shown that only around a third of victims will be represented by official figures. But women from Asian communities are far less likely to come forward.” Ansar added: “There are undoubtedly a disproportionate number of Pakistani men involved, but they have no loyalty to any one community.” Two Asian girls have told us they were targeted by street grooming gangs, and raped by multiple men throughout their teenage years. One fled Telford in terror after years of hell at the hands of serial predators. But while some of her attackers were reported to West Mercia Police as part of its 2012 Operation Chalice, which saw eight men jailed, she said some of the worst still walk free. The woman, 13 when her abuse began, told us: “The police don’t know about me, even though I was raped and abused like all my white friends. “My life was hell too, but people think these things don’t happen to girls like me because of the colour of our skin. In the end, I had to get out.” When we urged her to contact the police, she insisted: “I’ll \u0026shyprobably never tell, it would be so painful for my family.”  But when she sees far-right groups coming to Telford she feels her suffering has been ignored, that girls like her “don’t matter”. Another girl, now in her 20s, told how she was preyed on by a relative linked to a notorious group of abusers, who raped her from the age of 11. Like countless others, she was taken to local beauty spot The Wrekin, to be abused away from prying eyes. She said: “The first time, I was 11. He put the bonnet up on his car so passers-by couldn’t see. I was trembling. “I was in so much pain but I didn’t scream. I felt he’d broken me. He said to go home and bath. After that it was three or four times a week for five years.“Her abuser is now dead. Files on another girl, targeted at 15 by two suspected Asian drug dealers, show she fell pregnant four times in six years. Social services, teachers and mental health services were aware of the girl’s plight – but did not inform police. The Sunday Mirror has seen case notes that show authorities admitted failing on “concerns of physical abuse and sexual exploitation”.   Spin plea on our probe A key figure in safeguarding children in Telford attacked our investigation in the town, claiming it could stop current victims from coming forward. Andrew Mason, who chairs the area’s Safeguarding Children Board, claimed in an email our 18 months of research had been conducted “on the back of a fag packet”. He made his comments as he begged a journalist from news website The Huffington Post to write a positive story about how child sex abuse in the town was handled.  In an email seen by the Sunday Mirror under a Freedom of Information request, Mr Mason admits “terrible things happened in Telford” and “many mistakes were made in the past”. But in an astonishing outburst he added: “Perhaps as I write this a sexually abused young person in our community, plucking up the courage to come forward, might see what is being said, change their minds and say nothing.” In fact, the week we exposed the scandal more than a dozen girls told police for the first time of their abuse. Our story also prompted a public inquiry. Meanwhile Telford and Wrekin Council, led by Councillor Shaun Davies, has hired a PR expert to help revamp its image. Council officials were told the appointment of Jan Jennings would help press officers with “strategic messaging and reputational recovery.” Our shock findings force police to go after the abusers Police have launched a new probe into child sexual exploitation in Telford as a result of the Sunday Mirror’s expose. Sources in the West Mercia force have confirmed a fresh operation will focus on “non recent” cases of abuse in the Shropshire town. More than a dozen brave women came forward to tell cops about their own abuse ordeals the week after we published the shock findings of our 18-month investigation. It forced the local authority to order a public inquiry into a repeated failure by the authorities to stamp out networks of abusers who have preyed on young girls for four decades. The new police investigation has been launched to bring the perpetrators to justice. This newspaper first asked for a probe in 2016. Then 10 police and council officials wrote to the home office to say it wasn’t necessary. But in a major U-turn Labour- run Telford and Wrekin Council agreed in April to the inquiry. Independent groups have now been invited to bid for a contract to appoint a chair and set the terms of reference for the inquiry, which is expected to begin its work later this year.  Horrifying scandal unfolded over 40 years 1980s: Predatory abusers start to target vulnerable girls in Telford, picking them up on the streets and outside a children’s home. One girl falls pregnant after being abused and passed around several men, but when she tells her doctor of the abuse he dismisses her as mentally ill. 1996: A concerned resident tells police about ringleader Shahzad “Keith” Khan, whom she suspects of abusing and selling Telford teenagers. She says her claims were not followed up. Late 1990s: Social workers become aware of the abuse, but a council-commissioned report later claims they failed to act because they did not understand the problem.  2000: Lucy Lowe, 16, is killed in a house fire set by cabbie Azhar Ali Mehmood, now 44, who made her pregnant at just 14. Lucy’s mum and sister also die. Mehmood was later jailed for life for the murders. Another schoolgirl tells murder cops that Mehmood groomed her too, but no abuse probe is launched. 2002: Becky Watson, 13, dies in a car accident described as “a prank”. Tragic diaries reveal Becky had endured two years of rape hell prior to her death. 2009: Becky’s friend Vicky Round dies, aged 20, in a drugs incident. Her family say grooming gangs got her hooked on crack at 12 and heroin at 14. 2013: The police’s Operation Chalice, which identified 200 men suspected of raping young Telford girls, produces just eight convictions. August 2016: The Sunday Mirror reports that the exploitation problem is continuing outside underage discos in the town, and that cops have failed to log abuse reports from concerned street pastors. September 2016: Telford’s Tory MP Lucy Allan asks PM Theresa May to launch an independent inquiry into abuse in Telford. Ten police and council officials tell the Home Office a probe is not needed.  March 2018: The Sunday Mirror publishes the results of its 18-month investigation into child sexual exploitation in Telford, which links five deaths to the abuse and reveals there could be up to 1,000 victims over four decades. Our story prompts more than a dozen girls to go to police. April 2018: Telford councillors vote unanimously to commission an independent inquiry into child sexual exploitation following our revelations. June 2018: Telford and Wrekin Council invites independent bodies to apply to commission a chair for the inquiry, expected to start in the autumn.

So does Matej and it’s been a good relationship.“Along with Neil Alexander, our coach, we have a goalie union and it is a fun working environment.“At the end of the day we all support each other and, whoever plays, that continues.“It’s good competition and it’s good for the team.“We prepare in training and whoever is picked, they will do their best. This is the life of a goalie really.”And he believes whoever is in the team, they will handle the rigours of a Scottish style of play that is, in some ways, a change from what they’ve been used to abroad but in many others just the same.“I haven’t really found the games here that different,” Siegrist added.“The continental game, if you like, is a little bit more passing and moving than here.“They play it long at times here and quicker than you would get overseas.“I will kick it long but also play the ball out from the back.“It is important when you do play it long it is to good areas where the strikers can use it as a weapon and not just kick the ball up to the stands.”For Siegrist, the most important thing going into today is United are now approaching the game with a degree of confidence.His feeling is the new-look line-up is ready for the all-important Championship action and he sees last week’s convincing Betfred Cup win at Elgin City as proof of that.“Obviously, the results were not always there in the cup but I think we have seen a lot of improvement from game one to the last game.“We wanted to win every game, each time you step on the pitch that competitive edge needs to come out, but I think we have seen a lot of improvement despite some of the results.“We understand now how the gaffer wants us to play.“It takes practice in training as well and, at the same time as playing these games, we had to practice for a long season ahead.“There are no excuses but there were some tired legs in the games because we worked hard from Monday to Friday and then we had a game on Saturday.“Everything has to come together and I thought in the last game, especially the second half against Elgin, we put everything together and did a good job.“The physical part was there, we didn’t get tired towards the end.“We had some fresh legs coming on in the second half, we played good football and we scored goals.“It was a good game to get some confidence from.“We are now going in on a high, we have prepared well this week and we will give it our all.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b641f2320425-848x564.jpg ","title":"kyle falconer kicks off solo tour in dundee proving the view frontman is a big success","story":"\t\t\t\t\tKyle Falconer has kicked off his first solo tour with a performance in Dundee – and he did it with a bang.There was a capacity crowd and a muggy atmosphere at Ward Road venue Church on Thursday night as The View frontman belted out his newest tunes in style.The Dryburgh star’s debut solo album No Thank You was released just a week ago and already the crowd could chant back every word of each song.The album was recorded in Paul Weller’s Black Barn studio in Surrey last year and was produced by Falconer on his own for the first time.Before the main act appeared, Kyle was supported by three local acts.First up was Kyle’s life-long friend Billy Mitchell, whose set included crowd favourites Losing Control and his newest single Psycho.Electro pop band Echo Machine was next.The gig was a family affair with Kyle’s brother Ronnie Falconer and his band Th13ves taking on the role of main support.No Thank You reached number 16 in the UK midweek charts following its release with fans praising the record for showing off Kyle’s voice.Kyle previously revealed that Liam Gallagher chose the title of his new solo album while the pair were on holiday together.The singer said that its name was selected by friend and former Oasis frontman while they were on holiday with their partners in Thailand last January.Kyle will continue the celebration of his album tonight in Aberdeen. He heads across the border in September to Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds.Hats Off To The Buskers was the first of The View’s five albums and featured anthems like Wasted Little DJs, Superstar Tradesman and Skag Trendy, the video for which was filmed near the homes of the band members in Dryburgh.The album went platinum after selling around 319,000 copies in 2007.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"major retail and housing development for local area hangs in balance","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMulti-million-pound plans for a major development including more than 400 homes are hanging in the balance.Up to 420 homes, a business park, food and non-food retail units and a creche form the ambitious masterplan for Westwood Park in Glenrothes.Planning permission in principle was granted three years ago and a section 75 legal agreement suggested developers should pay £3,300 per housing unit towards infrastructure costs.However, a snag has now emerged after agents acting for developer Landteam Scotland called on Fife Council to reduce the sum being sought towards transportation improvements.Shepherd and Wedderburn has written to the local authority arguing a change in planning guidance since means there is “no longer any justification in policy or guidance” for that level of payment – arguing the figure should be revised down to £1,302 per dwelling.Kevin Treadwell service manager at Fife Council, said: “As the development has not yet commenced, the developers of Westwood Park have applied to revise their legal agreement so that their contributions are aligned to the most up-to-date guidance.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"new striker adil nabi in dundee squad for st mirren opener","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew signing Adil Nabi goes straight into the Dundee squad for today\u0026#8217s Premiership opener at St Mirren.The 24-year-old will likely have to settle for a place on the bench, however.Coming back into the team will be star midfielder Glen Kamara after he shrugged off an ankle injury picked up in training last week.The Finnish international missed wins at Peterhead and home to Brechin but is expected to return.Striker Sofien Moussa, too, is expected to have got over his rib injury he suffered against Dunfermline.The Tunisian was given painkilling injections to get through the game at Balmoor but wasn’t able to play against Brechin.There are still question marks over the fitness of central defender Genseric Kusunga.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"only five players remain from when mccann took charge but dundee far from the finished article","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMore than a year into the job and with plenty of players in and out, Dundee boss Neil McCann is beginning to feel this squad is his own, though he admits they’re “far from the finished article”.Only five first-team players remain since Neil took the reins at Dens Park in June 2017 – Cammy Kerr, Darren O’Dea, Paul McGowan, Jesse Curran and Craig Wighton.After two summer windows – still four weeks to go in the current one – and a winter transfer period, it’s clear the Dens gaffer has put his own stamp on the side, though he admits he’s still got work to do on that front.He said: “The squad has evolved since I came in.“A lot of those boys that were here when I came in served me great.“When I’ve asked them to come in and do a job, they gave me everything but a lot of those boys have decided, when they’re not featuring regularly, they want to move on, and have.“I’m still looking to bring in some more but I’m pleased with the group I have just now.“You want to mould a team and how it wants to play and it has to be your team – there’s no point coming in and trying to use the previous manager’s ideas and ways he wants to play, it has to be your own.“I’m getting to the stage where I’m seeing things coming, but we need to bolt lots together because we’re far from the finished article.”Neil has been clear in his pursuit of further options at left-back and up front.Former Morton defender Mark Russell is in on trial along with former West Brom forward Adil Nabi.

I’ve gone on record saying I can’t spend my entire time talking to the fan base but I needed to put in place something that has me speaking to them and listening to them.“The latter is as important as the former and I think I’ve done that. Some people will argue that I could have done more, some people will argue that I might have done less, but we’ve tried to get the level of communication and engagement right.“The final thing is we’ve not hidden anything. I can’t answer every single question that I’m asked but I’ll say that where I can answer, I will.”Perhaps the one troublesome area that remains for Martin and his board is with their backing of manager Csaba Laszlo.After the failure to win promotion, some want him gone, while it’s clear others are adopting a wait-and-see policy when it comes to turning up for matches.Despite a poor Betfred Cup campaign, the chairman remains firmly behind his manager and expects a rebuilt squad to be successful this season.“I said at the end of the season that Csaba was going to lead our campaign this year. We’ve worked with him over the last 11 weeks putting together his squad, his coaching staff and putting in place the other elements of the infrastructure he needs to execute his job properly.“We were very disappointed with the (Betfred) results to be honest. Every competition we go into, every match, we want to win and although it does come very early in the season with not much of a pre-season behind you, that’s the same for all clubs. We were in no different position so far as that was concerned.“I think where things were different here was the complete overhaul of the coaching and the playing staff and so we had the added complication of gelling the team basically.“We were disappointed with the outcome, but it didn’t wholly surprise us given the stage we were at in terms of rebuilding the squad.”Like his manager, Martin believes last weekend’s win at Elgin in the final Betfred tie shows the team is now gelling and ready for a strong promotion push.Even so, he does not hesitate to stress in the clearest terms what an acceptable conclusion to this season will be.“Win the league. The league is our No 1 priority, there is no doubt about that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b641fc89a99f-e1533298226211.jpg ","title":"today

on a rather unusual venture at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.To celebrate his 13th year as a Fringe performer, Bruce is not only performing comedy but also taking comedy fans on a sightseeing tour of all places Shakespeare in Tayside.Following on from the success of his Macbeth-themed show at last year’s Fringe, Bruce is ferrying people around to places such as Dunsinane Hill near Collace and going from Birnam Wood to Dunsinane in Highland Perthshire.It all means a rather hectic next month for Bruce.He is performing his latest show at The Beehive in Edinburgh at 9.30pm nightly then, once he comes off stage, he will get some sleep before driving folk around Perth the following day, arriving back in Edinburgh just in time to go on stage again.Bruce, 53, who brought Kevin Bridges, Sarah Millican and Paul Sinnha from The Chase to his comedy clubs in Dundee and Perth, said: “My Fringe comedy show last year was all about Macbeth and I thought it would be a novel idea to take people to places where Macbeth walked and which are integral to his story.“I will be doing this during the duration of my show which lasts from tomorrow until August 22.“It means some very long days and nights but I am looking forward to it.“I will be on the go for a considerable amount of time.”Bruce is something of a veteran at one of the world’s most famous comedy events.He has performed to thousands at the Fringe and taken his past shows on tour.He has taken his brand of wit to Australia, New Zealand, Africa and the Far East as well as venues all over Britain.Bruce, a former physics teacher at Brechin High School, is also a former UK Speakers’ Club Speaker of the Year.The former Perth High pupil is also a highly-acclaimed entertainer at Burns’ Suppers and is mulling over an invite to officiate at one in Canada next year.But right now, he is concentrating on his arduous Fringe stint.“I hope the audience will get as much fun out of it as I will,” he

park.The area will be created at Gillies Park, with work expected to start on August 13.The games area will be built on the former tennis courts, on the south side of the park.Plans include a playground space for different activities as well as basketball hoops and goal posts.The facility is expected to be similar to a games area created at Baxter Park in Stobswell in 2014, which cost £187,000.Details of the project were first revealed by Broughty Ferry councillor Kevin Cordell in 2017.He said: “The community has worked very hard for this and I was happy to facilitate meetings with officers and elected members throughout the process.“I know the multi-use games area will be a welcome addition to the local community and will encourage more children to enjoy the park, in safety.“The fantastic proposals are testament to the determination of the local community and council officers.”As part of the Dundee Decides initiative, which saw residents across the city decide how £1.2 million would be spent through the community infrastructure fund, extra lighting will also be installed along the pathways in the park.The Broughty Ferry ward voted to spend £25,000 of its budget allocation on lighting the paths.Dundee City Council leader John Alexander said: “We’re committed to improving our parks, play equipment and providing new spaces for communities.“We invest hundreds of thousands of pounds every year to make that a reality and I’m pleased that we have been able to work on delivering the Gillies Park multi-use games area.“These are really exciting proposals that are important to making the Ferry look and feel more attractive, while also making Gillies Park safer by installing lighting around the park.”Over the last five years, Barnhill Tenants’ and Residents’ Association has been trying to improve Gillies Park.The group secured £70,000 of funding from the council’s neighbourhood services towards the multi-use games area.A sub-group made up of members of the association carried out door-to-door canvassing in the community to find out if residents would support the project.It started campaigning for the multi-use games area to be created two years ago and today welcomed the successful planning bid.Audrey Murphy, who was chairwoman of the association during the fundraising campaign, said: “We are very grateful for the support we received from Barnhill Primary School, local councillors, former councillor Laurie Bidwell and members of the sub-committee.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the

In addition to converting an equestrian centre into a holiday complex, the others are for a farm house, a detached house and an agricultural shed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"These may herald even more development in turn threatening to form a circle that, if unchecked, would eventually widen, join-up and constrict the core site protected by our charity,\" Mr Skinner said.He also cited the recent approval of a golf course at the Coul Links which falls within the Loch Fleet site of scientific special interest.He questioned whether either designation would still have any meaning if they were going to be run roughshod over by the current planning process.\"Culloden and the Coul Links are just two examples of a worrying trend,\" he said. \"Scotland\u0027 heritage is too often being cast aside for short-term economic gain.\"Four years ago, we argued for a planning framework which has the long-term wellbeing of our heritage sites built into it.

If I was fishing in the Ythan upstream and a seal came up to me I would be worried about the harm it could do to me.”It was revealed last month nobody has been charged for disturbing seals at the reserve since the special protection was given 10 months ago.Disturbing the seals can cause a stampede, meaning smaller animals can be crushed to death.Lee added he was grateful for all the help given to the group from members of the public.He said: “Ythan Seal Watch doesn’t exist without the help we get from an ever-increasing network of photographers, dog walkers and runners.“Everyone can help look after and conserve wildlife.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b61509434777-880x564.jpg ","title":"skys the limit for high flyer","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSpritely Chris Mutch has been flying high since reaching the age of 80.The grandmother of five fulfilled a four-decade old ambition when she took to the skies to soar 2,000 feet over the coastline of the north-east.Incredibly, this was not the first time the supergran was to find herself in the cockpit for a flying lesson – she was merely taking off from where she left off 45 years ago.“I won a flying lesson in a raffle and never forgot the experience,” said Chris, who stays in Rosehill.“It left a lasting impression on me.”A retired schoolteacher, Chris won the flying lesson at JTL Parkinson’s dinner and dance in 1973, where her late husband Jim worked at the time.But it was to take a few false starts before conditions were right for her to fly – which eventually happened on the six attempt!“My stomach would do flips and then the lesson would be cancelled, always when we were standing on the runway,” added Chris.“You have to be patient and keep a cool head, otherwise there is no point doing it.”On the day Chris did eventually find her wings the weather turned out to be perfect\u0026#8230 but the pilot was nowhere to be found.“He was late but there was another lad who was a pilot who took me up in a plane,” added Chris.“He was a qualified pilot but not an instructor, so although he could take me up, he would not have been able to log it, should I want to get a license.”Chris flew north of Dyce and was thrilled to see the landscape from the cockpit.But she was even more delighted to receive plaudits from her co-pilot.“We were only supposed to be up in the air a short time, but he said I was doing very well and I was allowed to handle the plane over the coast.“It was exhilarating, thrilling and I have never forgotten such beauty.”So when Chris’ landmark 80th birthday approached in February, she knew what she wanted as a gift.“My daughter Lesley asked me what I would like and I straight away said a flying lesson,” laughed Chris.“At my age it’s difficult to buy gifts for me as I really don’t need anything else to put in a cupboard or sit on a shelf.”Last month, Chris fulfilled her heart’s desire when she flew a Piper Warrior from Longside Airfield near Peterhead.And it was a case of deja vu all over again for Chris.“On our fourth attempt we finally were able to get up in the air,” Chris added.“It was worth the wait. Apart from the technical information, which went a little over my head, it felt the same as before. The ground is uniformed, neat and tidy and it is so peaceful you feel like you are soaring in the air. It was simply stunning.”With nerves of steel, Chris piloted the plane and even had a back seat passenger, daughter Lesley.Lesley, 54, who works as a receptionist at Saks Hair \u0026amp Beauty in Union Square, said: “I knew my mum would definitely go for it and I was more than happy to go up with her then and will be happy to do so again.”Flying instructor Bill Anderson, who operates with Buchan Aero Club, declared Chris had “the knack” and she received hundreds of likes on daughter Lesley’s social media page for her efforts.So will Chris be seeking out her pilot licence anytime soon?“No,” she exclaimed. “But I can’t wait for my next lesson.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b6546d24fa97-846x564.jpg ","title":"two aberdeen dementia units to close due to lack of staff","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNHS Grampian is to close two Aberdeen dementia units for a year due to the staffing crisis, the Evening Express can reveal today.The health board has confirmed it has taken the “extremely difficult” decision to temporarily close Loirston ward and Lochhead Day Hospital at Royal Cornhill Hospital (RCH).A total of 38 dementia patients will be affected by the move with hospital bosses saying it is “simply unsafe” to continue running the services.The hospital has more than 55 registered trained nursing vacancies – amounting to 22% of its workforce.And the health board has warned they could face “more difficult decisions” in the future unless more mental health nurses are recruited.Jane Fletcher, head of hosted mental health and learning disability services, said: “It is simply unsafe for us to try to run our services, in their current format, with that number of unfilled posts.“In recent months my team have been exploring different ways of working or using different mixes of staff groups to find a long term solution.“In the meantime, staff on the wards have gone above and beyond the call of duty in providing cover.“However, working in this way is unsustainable.“I also have a duty to look after the staff here so they are able to look after their patients.”Arrangements are being made to find alternative accommodation for 10 patients on the Loirston Ward – a 12-bed ward which provides care for women with progressing dementia, and associated symptoms of stress and distress.Five of these patients are delayed discharges, who no longer require hospital care, but require appropriate care home places or a care package.The remaining five patients require a higher level of care so work will be carried out to find accommodation for these patients.It is not known where these patients would be located but the health board has said it recognises the importance of this being as close to the patients’ homes as possible.A total of 28 patients use the Lochhead Day Hospital, a dementia assessment hospital.A daughter of a long-term patient at the hospital, who did not want to be named, said: “It is so sad to find out this facility is being removed, even if only for the 12-month period.“It has been a safe haven for my loved one and we have come to appreciate the short respite it has offered us as a family.“The staff here are absolute angels, who are already working extremely hard, under the most trying of circumstances.“It’s a very sad day indeed that NHS Grampian have failed to recruit trained staff. I fear this is only the beginning.”Isla McGlade, interim associate nurse director for mental health and learning disability services, said 22 newly qualified nurses will join the hospital in October.She added: “While this is an enormous boost, these new recruits will need support as they settle into their first job after graduation.“In the short term we are working with nursing agencies to recruit appropriately trained staff as soon as possible to cover from now until the newly qualified nurses are settled.“However, this still leaves us with more than 30 vacancies.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"university takes part in healthy eating research","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen university has teamed-up with two other research institutes to look at Scotland’s dietary goals.Research by Robert Gordon, Abertay and Newcastle universities has shown that the country’s national diet and health has not improved in the past 15 years.The study, which was funded by Food Standards Scotland, looked at annual trends in food intake between 2013 and 2015, compared to 2001 to 2012.

Since then he has made his international breakthrough and captained Scotland in a 1-0 summer friendly loss to Mexico.McKenna will be at the heart of the defence in a game against Rangers that marks new Ibrox boss Steven Gerrard’s first domestic game.After the disappointment of losing at Turf Moor, skipper Shinnie challenged the Reds to bounce back with a victory.He said: “Pittodrie will be packed for Rangers and it is a good game to have off the back of the Euro tie.“We need to put that (loss to Burnley) at the back of our minds.“It is a massive game but that is what it is like at Aberdeen – big games come thick and fast.“We know the crowd will be there in their numbers so it is another game where we have to step it up.”Aberdeen were up against a side with an immensely superior budget in Burnley, who have a £37m players’ wage budget.Tomorrow the figures may be smaller but there is still a gulf between the budget of Rangers and that of Aberdeen.The Ibrox club have backed Gerrard’s rebuilding by sanctioning transfers in excess of £5m during the summer.There have also been high-profile loan deals that will require high wages.Shinnie does not care about the cash the Ibrox club are splashing out, though.On the disparity between the two club’s budgets, he said: “That is out of our control and we just focus on ourselves.“The games against Burnley have been positive for us and we look to take that momentum into the league.”Aberdeen may have been knocked out of Europe but Shinnie reckons they regained some pride for Scottish football.It is a tie he believes the Dons deserved to win over the two legs to book a third qualifying round clash against Istanbul Basaksehir of Turkey.He said: “In Scotland teams know what we are all about – we have proved that over the last couple of years.“Maybe we have now shown people down in England what Scottish football is all about.“It is not as bad as what the English make it out to be.“But in Scotland, in terms of us, we have shown what we are all about.“We have got a big season ahead of us again to show that.”Aberdeen may have been underdogs against Premier League Burnley but, make no mistake, there was a belief in this squad they could progress.It was this confidence which made losing out in extra time all the more difficult to take for the Aberdonian, particularly as the Reds had opportunities to win the tie.He said: “We are gutted that we did not get through because that is what we wanted and what we set out to achieve.“No matter who it was against, we wanted to get through and we had the opportunities to do that.“It is disappointing but we will take the positives.“We can be proud of what we did… but it wasn’t good enough.“At the start of the game Burnley were good, although we didn’t start great in the first half.“Once we got to grips with the game, we got right into it.“In the second half, again, we didn’t start overly great but went on to be the better team and create the better chances.I thought, over the two legs, we were probably the better team but we didn’t take our chances and, in the end, that kills you.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"readers think matters us give us piece mind","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMaking assumptions about what our readers want is a risky way to make business decisions.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine.

Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jenny celebrates 90 years","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 7:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowJenny Speirs of Inveraray recently celebrated her 90th birthday.She celebrated the milestone in style with a lunch party for family, friends and neighbours including cousins from Australia.Jenny thanks everyone for the lovely cards, flowers and gifts given to her during the celebrations.Donations in lieu of presents, at Jenny\u0026#8217s request, raised £300 for Cancer Research.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sheep and showers in high quality blackface show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 04/08/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA high quality show of sheep was held at Cairndow amid heavy showers interrupted by fiery sunshine.The annual Cowal Blackface Sheep Breeders\u0026#8217 Association show at Clachan \u0026#8211 right beside the Loch Fyne Oysters complex \u0026#8211 drew curious (if slightly bemused) tourists and seasoned hill shepherds in almost equal measure.The sheep show has, in recent years, been supported by a display of vintage tractors and other machinery, and this year Cowal Vintage Transport Club and Bute Vintage Club provided the gleaming hardware for visitors to enjoy.You can find pictures of the vintage machinery show on page 34.In the show ring, the overall champion came from Dyke Farm, Milton of Campsie, with a young ewe by £24,000 Elmscleugh out of a ewe by a son of Travis.The reserve overall was a ewe by Buffalo out of a dam by a £4,000 Midlock from Messrs MacPherson, Balliemeanoch, Loch Awe.In the section confined to the district of Cowal, the champion was from Pole Farm, Lochgoilhead, with a gimmer by Spectre out of a ewe by a £5,200 Allanfauld sire.The confined reserve champion \u0026#8211 and best sheep of the opposite sex to the overall champion \u0026#8211 was from Messrs Campbell, Drimsynie, Lochgoilhead, with a shearling tup by Allanfauld Pogba out of ewe by a 40k Nunnerie sire.

Before the roads were made these were important links- the sea unites and the land divides.Arguably the most important ferry followed the Inveraray \u0026#8211 St Catherines route, connecting with coach services to Loch Goil and the onward steamer to Greenock or Glasgow.At one time a large sailing boat carried horses and cattle. A rowing or sailing yawl conveyed pilgrims, pedlars, travellers and soldiers. Pilgrims and blind persons were carried free.From the 17th Century the ferry and ferryman\u0026#8217s house were auctioned annually by Inveraray Town Council to the highest bidder, with the burgh providing the two vessels. The ferryman kept the fares, and part of the deal was that the minister and magistrates would travel free of charge.When Inveraray new town was built in the 18th Century the Ferry Land housed the ferrier, who supplemented his income by running a dram shop. The Ferry Inn was a popular pub until 1917, when its licence was revoked.In 1827 David Napier, later a famous shipbuilder, introduced two steamers, the Thalia and Robert Bruce, from Inveraray to St Catherines and other ports on Loch Fyne. In 1836 the Lochgoil and Loch Long Steamboat Company became tenants of the ferry with a small paddle steamer, though the rowing/sailing boats were still available for a lower fare.From St Catherines their horse-drawn coach conveyed passengers to Lochgoilhead, from where they joined a steamer to the central belt.In 1856 the company introduced a new steamer, the Argyle. She was not a success, with author Alexander Smith describing her as \u0026#8216a small wash-tub of a steamer that carries you across Loch Fyne in an hour\u0026#8217.In 1865 the Inveraray Ferry and Coach Company took over with their beautiful little steamer, the Fairy.The route did not pay, however, and in 1892 the town council set up the ferry as a municipal enterprise with Fairy II, a little steel paddle steamer. When to town council gave up running the service in 1909, Mr John Dewar continued until the Fairy II was wrecked in the great storm of November 1912.Thereafter there were a number of ferriers. James Douglas used a Loch Fyne skiff fitted with a motor and Hope MacArthur operated launches called the Happy Return and the Jean.The car and bus rendered the sea link unnecessary and the service ended in 1963.A winter trip across Loch Fyne is recorded in the following song, sung to the tune \u0026#8216Kitty of Lochgoil\u0026#8217. Here are some of the verses:The Fairy in the Fog\u0026#8216Twas in the year of \u0026#821781On Januar\u0026#8217 the fourth dayThe steamer Fairy crossed Loch FyneTo Sweet St Catherines bay.Our Captain Bold was Duncan BellOur pilot Donuil DhuThe engineer Shon GilliesAnd Dugal Piobair was the crew.The passengers were soon aboardThat Coachy Jock had broughtAnd then again through blinding fogOur homeward way we sought.The day with fog was thick and darkYou could neither hear nor seeBut Donuil Dhu just kept her noseStraight from St Catherines quay.The pilot at his stemmy postStood firm as any rockThe compass true before his eyesJust like my grandfather clockAs we came near the Newtown bay.Our reckoning scarce could failSaid Dougal Piobair to himself\u0026#8216I wish we saw the jail\u0026#8217.The captain stood upon the deckA few feet from the funnelAnd to the pilot passed the word\u0026#8216Keep clear of Mackenzie\u0026#8217s tunnel\u0026#8217.Already we were sheering offOur course we knew quite wellWhen through the fog some lengths awayThere came a dismal yell.\u0026#8216Now what was that?\u0026#8217 the captain cried\u0026#8216I ne\u0026#8217er heard the like before\u0026#8217Said Dugal Piobair: \u0026#8216Sure it is a Pochkan on the shore\u0026#8217.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13025651.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_lhr_ayp_300718ayr.jpg","title":"ayr united daft musician set","story":"NewsAyr United-daft musician set to donate cash raised from song to clubHonest Man Jason Skimming, who fronts the Seaside Sons, is getting prepared to hear his band’s new song United With Pride being belted out against Partick Thistle.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet10:11, 3 AUG 2018NewsSeaside Sons (Image: unknown handout)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn Ayr-daft musician is giving something back to his beloved team. Honest Man Jason Skimming, who fronts the Seaside Sons, is getting prepared to hear his band’s new song United With Pride being belted out against Partick Thistle. He said: “The AU500 group asked me to help out with sponsorship, but I do a lot for the club with my work Caledonian Vehicle Solutions. “So then I said my band would record a song and donate cash to the club through that. “As a band we haven’t written an original song about Ayr United so hopefully people will like it and it will stick around for years to come.”  Jason, 32, has supported Ayr United for as long as he can remember. Seaside Sons will also play Prestfest this Saturday and will support Kyle Falconer on Sunday at Elliots. The band recruited Ayr supporting musicians to help with the recording.

Much the same reaction as when food is about and the hungry gulls swoop. South Ayrshire Council has just introduced tough metal bins in Ayr High Street that gulls cannot peck rubbish and scraps out. At the moment with starving fledglings about, some of the birds are highly aggressive. Former air traffic control staffer Dave Kennedy,65, of Ayr said: “Some people feed gulls and that encourages them back. They are a nuisance, feral and these bins are a good idea.” Christopher Cooper,32, is a care home worker who lives in the town centre and said: “I cannot even open my windows as they are too noisy and seem to go mental at 4am. I took a video and put it on Snapchat. Yesterday one stole a chip from my pal’s butty. More effort should be made.” Former council worker David Nichol,63, of Kilmaurs, said: “I don’t know much about ornithology but gulls they are so aggressive. “These bins are a great idea but if the gulls get worse here it will affect tourism. They are lovely looking birds, but they even fight in mid-air.” Retired council clerical officer Anne Russell,69, of Auchinleck, added: “The bins are great but the council needs to be more aggressive and take action against folk feeding them. “They have notices up about not feeding them - but people are still doing it. “We need a gull patrol like a traffic warden.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilKilmaursAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields two things must","story":"NewsBob Shields: Two things must happen at the Station HotelEmergency committee must be set upShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning07:00, 5 AUG 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“Ding dong . . . this is a Scot Rail passenger announcement . . . the next arrival at platforms one, two, three and four will be the 2018 death of Ayr Station. “This is due to Ayr Station Hotel deteriorating on South Ayrshire Council’s doorstep and no heads being on the line. “We apologise for any inconvenience and the loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds of your money. “The next train from a functional Ayr Station will the 2020 to Glasgow Central”. Yes dear readers, if all of the above was improbable – it might even have been amusing. But the demise and ultimate destruction of South Ayrshire’s busiest transport hub isn’t improbable – it’s inevitable. Last weekend, most of the United Kingdom was looking skywards for a glimpse of a “blood moon”. But on Saturday, I looked skywards as I walked across the Station Bridge . ... and all I saw was a bloody disgrace. Belts and straps have now been attached to Ayr Station Hotel’s chimney stacks in a bid to safely secure them. New areas at the Smith Street end of the station have been declared unsafe. The “no-go area” fencing that once cordoned a section of the front car park has been extended to barricade the entire building. If this was 1945, we could probably keep Rudolph Hess banged up in there! The harsh fact is that Ayr Station and its hotel have moved on from being a giant embarrassment to becoming the biggest threat to public safety, the local economy and the environment in South Ayrshire’s living memory. And what are South Ayrshire’s elected members doing about it? Er .... they’re all on their summer recess! On safety – is the Station Bridge REALLY safe for cars and pedestrians? A single lane was closed for “scaffolding work” – but it’s been scaffold-free for five weeks. If the gable-end chimneys need belts and buckles, is it prudent to allow the public to pass barely fifty yards below them? On the economy – I know my own business has been affected by the railway chaos. Many of my Ayr racecourse regulars by-passed the town centre and headed straight to the track from the station’s east side. And if I’m feeling it – God help the shops, bars, eateries and taxi drivers based around Smith Street and Burns Statue Square. On the environment – has anyone contemplated the dust, fumes and noise pollution that will surely come with demolishing a giant sandstone structure that’s visible from the Kilmarnock by-pass? MP Bill Grant was in my boozer last weekend – but on the first week of his hols, I extended the courtesy of letting him socialise with his friends. But I know he reads this page – and I hope he and MSP John Scott will be in agreement that two things must happen soon: 1) An Ayr Station Emergency Committee be set up involving all stakeholders – including structural and civil engineers, Scot Rail, South Ayrshire Council, road traffic management and local businesses. Its remit would be look at the entire station issue – and how best to fit all future works into the community. And if they can get Ayr Station Hotel’s owner to show up – a bit of public flogging wouldn’t go amiss either. 2) An independent investigation be set up to demand the facts from South Ayrshire Council on what they did – and didn’t do – as they watched an iconic town centre building fall into ruin right in front of them. And it has to be root and branch – every correspondence, every conversation, every e-mail – involving everyone from the Malaysian owners to our own Council executives and elected members. The council tax payers of South Ayrshire deserve the truth. And they certainly deserve better management of local resources than this current shambles .Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentTaxesAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"supermarket runs out 10p bags","story":"NewsSupermarket runs out of 10p bags in AyrWorkers had to resort to giving out more expensive bag-for-life style carriers in a bid to appease grocery laden shoppers.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston15:24, 1 AUG 2018Updated15:25, 1 AUG 2018News (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMorrisons in Ayr ran out of 10p plastic bags after bosses forgot to order them in. . . . that’s the claim by under-pressure staff.

The store is said to be among the most profitable Morrisons supermarkets in Scotland. But one staff member said: “This is the third time this month they’ve forgotten to order in the 10p bags - it’s unbelievable. And it had to happen on what seems like one of the busiest days of the year. “There are other Morrisons in Troon and Kilmarnock, you would think they could get an emergency supply from them, but apparently not.” The bustling store in the town’s Castlehill Road stopped selling 5p bags in a bid to go green and re-use the stronger 10p bags. A Morrisons spokeswoman said: “Due to a higher than normal demand one day this week, our Ayr store ran out of 10p bags.

But vehicles needing access to Old Cumnock Old Church for weddings or funerals will continue to have access. These vehicles will have to show a permit to access The Square. Any other vehicles will be hit by a fixed-penalty notice if they flout the new traffic regulations. The move is designed to improve safety to pedestrians and cyclists in the Square. One community councillor said it would stop parking outside the hairdressers and takeaways at the Square: “Traffic in the Square will be limited,” he added. “From the beginning of August anyone driving a car would need to have a permit. “It will be limited to funeral cars, wedding cars for church services “The main thing is they are going to block off pedestrian crossing outside the Royal Hotel. “So the cars are going to have to come in and go back out into Lugar Street. “It is going to be mayhem in Lugar Street. “I suggested reversing the one way system at Hamilton Place and make it street pedestrian only.” Another community councillor asked how it would be implemented. He added: “Who is going to patrol it? “Will it be police or traffic wardens. “I haven’t seen police in the square.” Stewart Turner, head of road at Ayrshire Roads Alliance, said: “Access to The Square will be limited to vehicles directly associated with wedding and funeral operations at Old Cumnock Old Church. “These vehicles will be required to display a permit to access The Square. Permits are available free of charge from the Ayrshire Roads Alliance. “We have contacted several wedding and funeral operators in the immediate area and advised of this requirement. “Exemptions to the access restriction include vehicles engaged in building work, road repairs, utility repairs, postal delivery, cash collection, furniture removal operations and the emergency services. “The Square will also have waiting and loading restrictions in force at all times. This will enable a Parking Attendant employed by the Council to issue a Penalty Charge Notice to any vehicle within The Square contravening the restrictions.  “Exemptions to the waiting  and loading restrictions are exactly the same as the access restriction.  “I do not anticipate traffic congestion on Lugar Street as a result of this Order. “The Order was promoted to prevent danger to pedestrians and cyclists in The Square. “The Order was advertised on Wednesday March 28 and received no objections. “The Order is fully supported by Police Scotland and they will be responsible for enforcing the restrictions.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPolice ScotlandCumnockAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"locals-saddle-up-for-newtown-st-boswells-farmers-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers \nShow\ntook place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.\nThe supreme winner of the show judged by Mr and Mrs Doddie Weir went to the hunter champion, the evergreen Fusilier, owned and ridden by Gillian McCowan.\nReserve supreme was Clive Storey\u0026rsquos Masquerade, who stood overall in the Coloured Section.\nDi and Joanna Walton judged the Ridden Hunters and their reserve was the runner up in the hunter class, Silver Dream Spirit, ridden by John Wilson from Selkirk.\nMorean Hamilton placed the In Hand Hunters and chose the winner of the two-year-old class as her Champion, West Country Lady Guinevere \u0026ndash a home bred filly owned by Sally Burns from Hawick.

them to Selkirk later this month.\nAnd thankfully Dani Aubert and Ian Van Ornum - better known as sensational folk duo Fellow Pynins - will be bringing a few songs with them.\nFellow Pynins have now arrived in the UK from their Southern Oregon mountain home.\nThe duo will play a string of dates including London, Cambridge and Maidenhead before heading to Scotland and Ireland next week.\nDani and Ian performed in their former years as a seven-piece folk orchestra called Patchy Sanders, which took them far and wide through the journey of songwriting and touring.\nAfter the folding of Patchy Sanders, the duo decided to take their love of songwriting and performing down to the bones, and used their acoustic instruments and voices to write the material for their first album, Hunter \u0026amp the Hunted.\nThey quickly received accolades for the 2016 release from the likes of BBC, Roots Magazine, and Country Music People.\nLisa Dunn of BBC exclaimed: \u0026ldquoFellow Pynins will transport you into their haunting and beguiling world of love tales and spine-tingling harmonies.\n\"They will have you travelling far and wide to hear them again.\nTheir first tour through Europe in 2016 brought them from Spain to Ireland\u0026mdash hitting small towns, far-reaching islands, and the greater metropolitan areas.\nTravelling with a nanny and Eowyn, their 5-year-old budding fiddler daughter, they played at cultural centres, pubs, and popular concert series.\nAnd the trip acted as a reconnaissance for the duo as they discovered their family history in Ireland and Scotland and began to collect the traditional songs of the people.\nThis spark of song collecting re-inspired their love of storytelling and performing intimate, acoustic concerts and infiltrated their repertoire of original songs with a smattering of uniquely interpreted traditional songs.\nFellow Pynins\u0026rsquo music employs the sounds of the mandolin, banjo, guitar, bouzouki and their voices in harmony to tell the stories of this human existence.\nThey will be touring through the UK and Ireland, playing 26 concerts in August, once again collecting lesser known traditional songs and gracing the stages from Cambridge Folk Festival to the mystical island of Iona.\nOn Friday, August 17 they will play at The Haining House in Selkirk from 8pm.\nTickets\n, priced at \u0026pound12.50, are available

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp. During their lifetime the sisters were very active in the village and did good work.

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

I remembered looking at photos from when Paris was liberated in 1945 after the German occupation and wondering what happened to the collaborators.‘It is written in a post-independence parallel world, so much has happened since 2014.‘Russia presents an amazing enigma of tremendous wealth but is their relationship with the West more about posturing?’One member of the dozen who attended the talk asked: ‘Do you think Scots would prefer Euros to Roubles?’Ms Lloyd said she glossed over the question of Europe but did imagine that Scotland would have to renegotiate its seat at the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.Ms Lloyd is working on a second book and said: ‘I have young children so I can indulge myself.’Russian Doll is available for £9.99 from Amazon and booksellers or direct from the author, who also sells a natty line in sports socks.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter sea photos wanted","story":"Photographers across the UK have just two weeks to enter their best images of the sea in an annual photography competition run by national maritime charity, the Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society.The competition, which closes on Monday, August 13, encourages amateur and professional photographers to submit pictures that best encapsulate Britain’s enduring connection with the sea.It celebrates the nation’s proud maritime heritage and our reliance on seafarers.The competition’s prestigious judging panel includes experts from the Sunday Times, the I, and Amateur Photographer Magazine, alongside the charity’s chief executive, Captain Justin Osmond.The overall winner of the competition will be presented with a voucher for photographic equipment.The Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society provides financial assistance to fishermen, mariners and their dependants who are suffering hardship, whether due to accident, ill health, unemployment or in retirement after a life spent working at sea.In the last year the charity received 560 new applications for assistance and distributed £1.4 million in more than 2,000 cases of need.To enter the competition go to: www.shipwreckedmariners.org.uk or  www.facebook/shipwreckedmariners and @ShipwreckedSoc.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lotto draws 4","story":"The draw for Dunaverty\u0026#8217s three number lotto was made on July 19.The winning numbers were five, seven and 17.There were no winners and the next draw for a jackpot of £200 will be held on August 12.Tickets are available from committee members, the club steward, Muneroy tearooms and the Burnside bar.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane august 3 2018","story":"In the days before rapid transatlantic flights, The Royal Mail Ship (RMS) Queen Elizabeth operated a weekly luxury liner service between Southampton and New York.A phone call, to the Southampton ferry and tug company Red Funnel, started a huge and challenging recovery exercise to refloat the 83,000 ton liner from the Bramble Bank.Tugs Canute, Clausentum, Neptune and Vulcan and Alexandra Towing Company\u0026#8217s Romey, Hornby and Poulsom were sent but soon it was realised more would be needed.Last week down memory lane featured the Royal Navy tug HMRT Bustler, a model of which is in Campbeltown museum.

Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.  The artists were commissioned to undertake the work, which is being funded by Tesco with \u0026pound38,000 for each of the two sculptures, as part of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art Policy."},{"url":null,"title":"coffee-shop-opens-at-historic-tolbooth-in-musselburgh","story":"  Mr Martin, who lives in Musselburgh and played Eric in the show, was invited to officially open The Coffee Gallery in the historic Tolbooth at the Old Town Hall, leased from East Lothian Council.

So far this year I have passed my driving test, bought my first car, moved house, opened my first business and am getting married.  \u0026ldquoI was looking to open my own place, partly because I wanted to be my own boss and partly because I wanted to explore more.  \u0026ldquoI have had several people approach me over the years to invest in me, so I eventually took the plunge.

He said: \u0026ldquoThis building is fantastic.  In keeping with the building\u0026rsquos heritage, he is displaying coffee related antiques in the shop, including a 200-year-old coffee roaster and, to mark a forthcoming golf exhibition in nearby Musselburgh Museum, is hoping to exhibit and sell golf prints.  \u0026ldquoOnce we are up and running we are going to devote a wall to local artists to exhibit their work.

Her dad Stan mounted the first major expedition to the caves, in the Andes Mountains in the east of the country, alongside astronaut Neil Armstrong in 1976.  Eileen, 31, will return to the country where she was born as part of a team including Mercury-nominated artist, producer and collaborator Jon Hopkins and neuroscientist Mendel Kaelen, as well as photographers, architects and filmmakers.  Eileen said: \u0026ldquoAfter a 10-year solo adventure into the depths of the Legend of Tayos and my father\u0026rsquos work, it is a real honour to be joined in this quest to protect the caves by such an inspiring group of fellow explorers with a collective knowledge and talent beyond anything I could have imagined was possible.  \u0026ldquoI am excited to be part of the efforts to continue what my father and Neil Armstrong started back in the 1970s and have renewed hope in the efforts of protecting these precious, beautiful and fragile environments from devastating destruction.  The trip, which costs about $50,000, is an eight-day creative expedition and will result in experiences, observations and documentation transformed into an exhibition in 2020. It is hoped the exhibition will shine a light on a drive to make Cueva de los Tayos\u0026rsquo unique and endangered ecosystem a UNESCO World Heritage site.  Eileen, who was born in the country\u0026rsquos capital Quito, moved to Dunbar in 1997, with mum Janeth working in Cherrytrees Nursery.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.  However, it also revealed that, in general, the county performed far better than Scotland\u0026rsquos national average when it came to alcohol-related health harm and crime. The average crime rate in East Lothian is 218.7 per 10,000 population, 34 per cent lower than the Scottish average of 331.2 per 10,000 population.  The number of alcohol-related deaths in East Lothian each year involving people over the age of 20 was estimated at 14.8, 33 per cent lower than the Scottish average of 21.8 deaths per 100,000 population.  And the percentage of people being admitted to hospital through drink-related incidences was also 33 per cent lower than the national average."},{"url":null,"title":"whats-on-at-scotlands-national-airshow-2018-on-saturday","story":"  Final preparations are under way for the event, which will see the acrobatic squad perform a new Centenary Split manoeuvre, specially introduced into their 2018 display to mark this year\u0026rsquos 100th anniversary of the RAF.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company had also contacted Prestonpans Community Council about its plans, with the former Cockenzie Power Station site seen as a possible home for the work.  It has also been suggested that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

Great Britain\u0026rsquos top men\u0026rsquos boat, the eight, found the Dutch pace too hot to handle in yesterday\u0026rsquos heat and will have to race again in today\u0026rsquos repechage.  Their big rivals Germany, racing in heat two, made no errors and held on to qualify automatically for Sunday\u0026rsquos final, despite a last-ditch charge from Romania.  There was also an upset in the men\u0026rsquos single sculls as Olympic and European silver medallist Damir Martin (CRO) missed out on a semi final place.  He finished third in his heat, behind Kjetil Borch (NOR) and Vladislav Ryabcev (RUS), after the Russian overtook Martin in the final quarter of the race.  The European Championships are a major innovation in world sport as seven sports bring their existing events together under one banner for the first time.  The next 11 days will see world class athletes in aquatics, cycling, gymnastics, golf, rowing and triathlon competing in Glasgow and Scotland, while Berlin hosts the athletics.  The first medals of the Glasgow 2018 European Championships will be presented to athletes from the sport of synchronised swimming, with competition getting underway at Scotstoun Sports Campus today.  A temporary swimming pool filled with 330,000 gallons of water has been constructed over the tennis courts for the nine synchronised swimming events over five days of competition.  Up to 750 spectators can watch the action unfold.  Top prospects for the British team are City of Bristol Synchronised Swimming Club\u0026rsquos Kate Shortman, 16, and Isabelle Thorpe, 17, who will compete in the Olympic discipline, the Duet Technical  Their mothers, Maria Shortman and Georgie Thorpe, also competed together for Great Britain in the 1980s.  The teenage pair won the Senior Free Duet title at the 2017 British Synchronised Swimming Championships in Nottingham.  Kate, who is also the current British Free Solo champion, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove been training all year for Glasgow a few junior competitions including Junior Europeans and World Juniors, which were really great preparation.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoWe just want to get out there and hopefully get a personal best, improve our scores from junior level.  Isabelle added: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore really excited to show everyone at senior level our new routines.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoWe competed earlier in the year in junior competitions and we can\u0026rsquot wait to get out there.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoCompeting in front of a home crowd is really nice, and everyone supporting is great \u0026ndash we can\u0026rsquot wait.  The Mixed Duet event at Glasgow 2018 will be only the second time men have been able to compete at a European Championships.  Gold medallist from the 2016 European Championships, Russia\u0026rsquos Aleksandr Maltsev said: \u0026ldquoWe are very excited, for me it\u0026rsquos the second European Championships. I was in London with another girl and now it\u0026rsquos our debut. We want to do our best, we will show our new technical programme.  Aleksandr is one of five men from five countries competing in Glasgow alongside: Pau Ribes Culla from Spain Vasileios Gkortsilas from Greece Giorgio Minisini from Italy (reigning World Champion) and Gokce Akgun of Turkey.  They will all compete in the Mixed Duet (Technical) this afternoon and again in the Mixed Duet on Tuesday morning.  Synchronised swimming events will take place at Scotstoun between today and Tuesday next week.

Judge Frances Eccles ruled that sovereignty and \u0026ldquoself-determination are \u0026ldquoweighty and substantial aspects of human life and the merits of McEleny\u0026rsquos case can now go forward to a full hearing.  The MoD had argued that independence is not a philosophical belief because it has little impact on people in Tanzania and Peru, an argument the judge rejected.  In 2016 McEleny, who is the SNP group leader on Inverclyde Council, announced his candidacy to become his party\u0026rsquos depute leader.  He was also an electrician at the MoD munitions site in Beith and, around the time of the leadership hustings, was told by his employer that his security clearance had been revoked and he was suspended.  National security officials interviewed him at his home and he was quizzed about his mental health, social media references to Rangers, Trident, and a pro-independence speech he made at an SNP conference.  McEleny quit after believing he had been targeted over his independence stance and pursued a discrimination claim against the MoD.  However, before the case could proceed, McEleny had to convince the judge that his independence convictions or the \u0026ldquosocial democratic values of the SNP amounted to a \u0026ldquophilosophical belief under the 2010 Equality Act and were thus a \u0026ldquoprotected characteristic.    Picture: McEleny  A key part of McEleny\u0026rsquos argument rested on a previous case \u0026ndash Grainger plc v Nicholson \u0026ndash which focused on a staff member who believed he was made redundant over his belief in climate change. In Grainger, the judge backed the claimant and ruled that his strong beliefs were protected under the law.  This previous decision stated that a philosophical belief had to be \u0026ldquogenuinely held, not be an opinion or viewpoint based on the present state of information available, and should relate to \u0026ldquoweighty and substantial aspects of human life and behaviour.  The belief must also attain a \u0026ldquocertain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance, and also be \u0026ldquoworthy of respect in a democratic society.  According to the judge\u0026rsquos summary of the evidence in the McEleny case, the councillor argued that the Grainger tests led to the \u0026ldquoinevitable conclusion that a belief in independence should be protected from discrimination.  McEleny, who was aided by written representations from former First Minister Alex Salmond, argued that his belief independence was \u0026ldquogenuinely held and was \u0026ldquoserious, cohesive and important.  He argued that the 2014 referendum, as well as the SNP\u0026rsquos participation in elections, were evidence of his belief being \u0026ldquoworthy of respect in a democratic society.  The summary noted: \u0026ldquoThe claimant submitted that he was not claiming to believe that Scottish independence could improve the lives and economy of Scottish people. His belief that decisions regarding Scotland should be made by the people of Scotland regardless of the outcome will never change.  McEleny, who represented himself, was quoted saying his belief in independence had affected his \u0026ldquoentire life, the choices and actions and decisions he takes.  In response, the MoD accepted that support for independence and the SNP\u0026rsquos values were \u0026ldquoworthy of respect, but claimed there was a big difference between political opinion or affiliation, and a philosophical belief:  \u0026ldquoSupport for Scottish independence and the social democratic values of the SNP ... is a political opinion. It does not have a similar status or cogency to a religious belief, the summary stated.  It added: \u0026ldquoWhether Scottish people would be better off voting for independence and the SNP ... is like any viewpoint, very much open for debate.  \u0026ldquoIt is an opinion with which many agree and many disagree. It will very much depend upon the present state of information available.  The judge\u0026rsquos summary of the UK Government\u0026rsquos position noted: \u0026ldquoIt [independence] does not impact on people in a general sense and provide a moral and ethical code by which people choose to live their lives.  \u0026ldquoRegardless of its importance to the electorate of Scotland ... Scottish independence and the SNP have no substantial impact on the lives of citizens in for example Tanzania, Peru or India.  The MoD also claimed that independence and the values of the SNP are not political opinions worthy of respect in any democratic society outwith the UK.  The summary stated: \u0026ldquoHe [the MoD solicitor] described them as a constitutional matter of concern to the UK but that is as far as they go.  The UK Government department also argued that support for independence is not on a par with a belief in democratic socialism, free market capitalism, Marxism or \u0026ldquosimilar political philosophy.  Eccles\u0027 summary of the MoD evidence concluded: \u0026ldquoA belief in Scottish independence does not impact upon the whole of mankind in terms of how we lead our lives or at least should lead our lives according to those who hold the belief.  \u0026ldquoIt lacks the moral or ethical conviction required to amount to a philosophical belief which is why ... the claim must fail.  In her ruling, the judge agreed with the MoD that support or active membership of a political party does not in itself amount to a philosophical belief, and argued that McEleny\u0026rsquos backing for the SNP\u0026rsquos social democratic values does not meet the requirements:  \u0026ldquoIf the SNP was to abandon its commitment to Scottish independence, something which I accept is unlikely, I am in no doubt that it could no longer be guaranteed the claimant\u0026rsquos support.  However, she wrote that McEleny\u0026rsquos belief in independence is not simply an opinion or viewpoint based on the present state of information available.  \u0026ldquoHe does not believe in Scottish independence because it will necessarily lead to improved economic and social conditions for people living in Scotland. It is a fundamental belief in the right of Scotland to national sovereignty.  The judge continued: \u0026ldquoI also do not accept that because Scottish independence might not impact on someone living in Tanzania ... or that Scottish independence is not of concern to a Tanzanian prevents the claimant\u0026rsquos belief from being philosophical in nature.  \u0026ldquoI am in no doubt that throughout a significant part of the last century national sovereignty and independence from British rule were weighty and substantial aspects of life in Tanzania, or Tanganyika as it then was.  She added: \u0026ldquoThe claimant has persuaded me that his belief in Scottish independence has a sufficiently similar cogency to a religious belief as required by Justice Burton in Grainger to qualify as a philosophical belief.    Picture: Aamer Anwar  The ruling means McEleny\u0026rsquos belief in independence can now be relied on as a \u0026ldquoprotected characteristic. A full hearing will take place in the case.  Lawyer Aamer Anwar, speaking on behalf of McEleny, said:  \u0026ldquoCouncillor McEleny welcomes this decision which makes legal history as it establishes in principle, a belief in Scottish Independence is capable of being a \u0026ldquophilosophical belief and therefore a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010.  \"This legal precedent now enables my client to pursue a claim for direct discrimination alleging that he was discriminated against because of this belief.  \"To date the MoD tried to maintain that his belief in Scottish independence could not be protected from discrimination yet they have lost their core argument in court.  \"It is completely unacceptable that the UK Government and Whitehall officials had Cllr McEleny suspended as he alleges because of his political affiliation and his belief in Scottish.\" independence.\"  An MoD spokesperson said: \"It would be inappropriate to comment on the details of an ongoing employment tribunal.\""},{"url":null,"title":"further-faster-higher-younger-edinburghs-festivals-of-extremes","story":"  Most head spins  Aichi Ono, from Kyoto in Japan, claims to have the world record for the highest number of head spins in one minute, at 142, and, indeed, you can see him doing them in an online video. But, according to the Guinness Book Of Records website it\u0026rsquos still Youssef El Toufali, who holds that record, at 137 in a minute. Whoever has spun the most or fastest, it\u0026rsquos clear Ono, who appears in Wasabeats Crew\u0027s Break Free at the Edinburgh fringe, is a remarkable human spinning top.  Speaking straight after he has finished a show in which he has done around 300 spins in total, he observes: \u0026ldquoI do more if the audience gets hyper. The 29-year-old, who began spinning when he was 13, recalls: \u0026ldquoWhen I started I practised eight hours a day with my head upside down. I can now actually make a phone call, or eat and drink, or text, while spinning.  None of this, however, seems to make him dizzy. \u0026ldquoWhen I finish spinning it feels quite normal. Some day Ono hopes to set a new record of 152 spins in one minute.  The hula marvel  Marawa Ibrahim may hold nine Guinness World Records in hula hooping \u0026ndash including the most hoops spun simultaneously (200) and the fastest mile run while hula-hooping \u0026ndash but that\u0026rsquos not strictly what she is at the Edinburgh International Book Festival to talk about.  Rather she\u0026rsquos there to discuss The Girl Guide, her funny, friendly handbook to navigating that really big challenge, puberty. Periods, body hair, sweat \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos all there, plus a few pictures of stretch-marked legs that are all about keeping it very real.  Round the world in (less than ) 80 days  78 days, 14 hours and 40 minutes was what it took Mark Beaumont to travel round the world by bike, having set off from the Arc de Triomphe in 2017. During the trip he smashed two Guinness World records. \u0026ldquoIf you don\u0026rsquot have the ability to suffer, you\u0026rsquore not going to make it, he once said. He talks about that challenge and his book, The Man Who Cycled The World, at an Edinburgh International Book Festival event.  Youngest playwright  It is possible that at some point in the long history of the fringe, there was some child prodigy younger than Isabel, the imagination behind the show I Let A Six Year Old Write My Show, but for the purpose of this piece, let\u0027s say she is the record-breaking youngest. Strictly speaking Isabel didn\u0026rsquot actually write it. Rather, as comedian Owen Roberts puts it, the daughter of his partner came up with the ideas in brainstorming sessions which were recorded, since he struggled to keep up with her \u0026ldquofree form verbal diarrhoea. Nevertheless, she was clearly at least its co-author, and reviews suggest an adult could never have created anything that funny \u0026ndash Roberts\u0026rsquo makes his stage entry to the strains of Let It Go from Frozen, while dressed in a chicken suit.  Oldest comedienne and burlesque performer  \u0026ldquoI\u0027ve got to the age where I\u0027m seriously thinking about what I\u0027ll be when I come back,\" is a gag Lynn Ruth Miller was turning out in comedy shows four years ago. At 84, she isn\u0026rsquot the oldest performer ever on the Fringe, but her website does advertise her as \u0026ldquothe oldest comedienne in the world.  Chances are the former Britain\u0026rsquos Got Talent contestant who started doing comedy at 71 and is formerly known as \u0026ldquoThe Stripping Granny, is the oldest performer on the burlesque scene too. Her show is on today, August 5, at Fringe By The Sea, 9pm  Nipples of fire  Okay, so this isn\u0026rsquot strictly speaking a Guinness World Record, but it ought to be. Kitty Bang Bang, one of the most renowned fire acts in the world, twirls flaming tassels from her nipples, at some risk to her skin and merkin. You can watch this marvel in the cabaret show, Little Death Club.  \u0026ldquoI started doing flaming nipple tassels for a burlesque show in the West End called Hurly Burly, she recalls. \u0026ldquoI was doing my fire act in the show and the director, William Baker, decided that he wanted me to do flaming nipple tassels so I did some research, bought a pair and took it from there. There aren\u0026rsquot many performers who do fire tassels because frankly, it kind of burns!  Longest Fringe gig  There are endurance athletes, and then there are endurance comedians. Mark Watson is the latter, capable of standing on a stage telling jokes virtually till he drops. Many comedians can barely manage an hour, but he just keeps on going. When, in 2006, he did a 36-hour gag stint, he didn\u0026rsquot register it in the Guinness Book of World Records, but it\u0026rsquos widely considered the longest Fringe gig ever.  Three years ago when he did a 27-hour show, he observed that such mega-shows had become, for him, \"a bit of an addiction\". \u0026ldquoYou can do so much with an audience in 27 hours. It does feel a bit tame going back to normal stand-up afterwards. This year\u0026rsquos show, the Infinite, which comes in at just an hour long, seems positively finite.  Most portraits sketched in 12 hours  In 2016, sitting on the Royal Mile, by the Adam Smith statue, American artist and fringe performer Walter Deforest churned out 160 portraits, breaking the former Guinness World Record set by David Gilhooley in 2014. Last year, he was back, with his show Van Gogh Find Yourself, and breaking it again with 163. Will he smash his sketch record again this year?  Most political demonstrations attended in one day  Back in 2006, activist and comedian Mark Thomas set the world record for most demonstrations attended in one day, squeezing in 20, including one to stop MPs having more than one job and another to sack private tube contractors. Four years later the record was broken by sixth formers from Freman College, Buntingford, when they held 23 consecutive protests across central London, all highlighting a different human rights issue.  Thomas\u0026rsquos show this year \u0026ndash Check Up: Our NHS At 70 \u0026ndash could make you want to get out and set your own protest record.  Longest paper doll chain  Though Julia Donaldson didn\u0026rsquot herself craft the paper dolls that were strung together in 2013 to make the longest paper doll chain of 4.5 km, she did, with her fantastical book, The Paper Dolls, inspire thousands of children across the world to make them.  The dearly loved children\u0026rsquos author brings a new show to the Fringe this year, featuring some of her most popular characters and titled The Gruffalo, The Witch And The Warthog.  Most pierced  Officially the most pierced woman in the world, according to Guinness, Elaine Davidson is not only a Fringe regular, but Edinburgh resident and icon. Her Kinky Freakshow introduces the audience to her astounding and ever-increasing collection of piercings.  Back in 2000 when she first set the record she had a mere 462, but by 2017 she was boasting 10,503, including many that are internal.  Sword swallowing  Miss Behave, who brings her Miss Behave Gameshow to the Fringe this year, set the world record for female sword swallowing in 2004, when she swallowed seven swords \u0026ndash it has since been broken by Natasha Varushka with 13. Even that, however, seems unambitious compared with the feats of the legendary Edith Clifford, the world\u0026rsquos most famous female sword swallower, who in the 1800s is said to have swallowed 18.  \u0026ldquoMy goal, Saunders has said, \u0026ldquoand it\u0026rsquos kind of fallen by the wayside, is to break Edith Clifford\u0026rsquos record if possible. I just need a very good props maker. For the Miss Behave Gameshow, however it\u0026rsquos less about the artiste stretching herself, than challenging the audience."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8161742.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scot-linked-to-brexit-dark-money-donation-faces-call-to-give-evidence-to-westminster-committee","story":"  SNP MP Brendan O\u0026rsquoHara said it was \u0026ldquoimperative that Richard Cook, chair of the secretive Constitutional Research Council, answered questions in front of MPs about the CRC\u0026rsquos infamous donation.  He believes Cook should be quizzed by members of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee, which has focused on the leave campaign as part of a wider probe.  It emerged last year that the CRC had ploughed in around \u0026pound435,000 to the pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in Northern Ireland during the referendum campaign.  However, although the cash was given to a party in Ulster, much of the donation was spent on the mainland in the form of a wraparound advert in the  newspaper, which is not sold in Northern Ireland.  Despite the size of the donation, the DUP was under no obligation to name the CRC as the source \u0026ndash declaration laws did not apply then to Northern Ireland \u0026ndash and did so voluntarily.  CATCH UP: What happened when the Sunday Herald spoke to Cook  The only detail to come out about the CRC is that Cook, who failed on several occasions to get elected for the Scottish Tories, chairs the body.  He confirmed the CRC has an executive committee, but has declined to name its members, put a figure on how much it has raised, or talk about other specific causes that have been funded.  Cook, who owns a modest house in East Renfrewshire, has also consistently refused to say who gave the CRC the \u0026pound435,000. He is under no legal obligation to provide the donor names, prompting critics to describe it as an example of \u0026ldquodark money.    Image: Cook (left) during the 2010 general election campaign  The DCMS last year launched an inquiry into the growth of so-called \u0026ldquofake news and the impact it has on the \u0026ldquopublic understanding of the world and on traditional journalism.  The committee, which issued an interim report recently, focused heavily on some of the tactics used by pro-Brexit groups during the referendum.  MPs have been praised for the work carried out as part of the probe, but have been hampered by the refusal of senior Vote Leave figure Dominic Cummings to attend.  Given the CRC\u0026rsquos prominent role in the referendum, O\u0026rsquoHara has written to the committee\u0027s chair, Tory MP Damian Collins, and called for Cook to give evidence.  He told this newspaper: \"I have called on the DCMS Committee to summon Mr Richard Cook to give evidence to our on-going inquiry into the vote leave campaign. It is imperative that we have a full understanding of his role, how the CRC processed \u0026pound435,000 to the DUP and whether he booked the infamous  advertisement for Vote Leave.\"  He added: \"It\u0027s time we had some answers \u0026ndash Richard Cook should help the DCMS Committee with their investigations and provide some much needed clarity.\"  Speaking to the Sunday Herald last year, Cook said of the body he chairs: \u0026ldquoThe CRC is regulated by the Electoral Commission. We operate solely in the UK. We accept donations only from eligible UK donors. We donate solely to permissible UK entities. Any suggestion that we have done anything else is basically defamatory.  Explaining the CRC\u0026rsquos internal decision-making process, he said: \u0026ldquoThe process is quite simple: people come to us with projects [and] they tell us how it is promoting the Union. The Executive Committee assess that and will decide. I don\u0026rsquot decide on my own. I\u0026rsquom just part of the process.  On who had contributed financially to the CRC, he said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to get into the donors, like I am not going to get into the members.  Asked if any Scots had donated to the CRC, he replied: \u0026ldquoYes.  Cook has made several\u0026nbspattempts at getting elected for the Scottish Tories, such as when he polled 13.4% in\u0026nbspGlasgow\u0026nbspCathcart in 2001. He came third again the same seat four years later in a\u0026nbspHolyrood\u0026nbspby-election.  In 2010, he tried to\u0026nbspdislodge\u0026nbspLabour\u0026rsquos Jim Murphy in East Renfrewshire, but lost by around 10,000 votes.  Cook did not provide a comment for the story."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mp-mhairi-black-uk-government-could-potentially-shut-down-holyrood","story":"  MP Mhairi Black made the comment after being asked about what the UK Government would do in the event of a national emergency.  In a wide-ranging interview at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, she also spoke about Catholic schools and her scepticism about holding another referendum on the European Union.  Black, who represents Paisley and Renfrewshire South for the Nationalists, was elected at the age of 20 and is widely seen as a future leader of the party.  During an \u0026ldquoin conversation event yesterday chaired by journalist Graham Speirs, she told the audience that Westminster could ultimately legislate on any matter in Scotland, despite devolution: \u0026ldquoThe UK Parliament can do what they like with us, legally, can do what they like. The only thing that is left stopping them is the political will.  Asked if the Government would shut down the devolved parliaments if they called a state of national emergency, she replied: \u0026ldquoPotentially.  On the prospect of a second Brexit vote, she said: \u0026ldquoMy genuine answer is \u0026lsquowhat\u0026rsquos the point?\u0026rsquo She argued that Scotland had already voted to remain and had been \u0026ldquoignored, which is why she wanted to talk about independence.  Black also said that none of the political parties, including the SNP, had a good campaign during the Brexit referendum because there was \u0026ldquono natural desire for the referendum and the debate was fought on the \u0026ldquoturf of the political Right.  The MP also said a \u0026ldquolot\" of people, even in the SNP, have concerns about the European Union and its institutions, but claimed there was \u0026ldquono room to have a \u0026ldquomature debate on the subject.  Asked whether she, and the SNP, believed it was good for the future of Scotland to have children educated along religious lines, Black, who attended a Catholic school, offered a \u0026ldquopersonal view.  She said: \u0026ldquoJust when I am thinking of some of the damage that was done to me, in an LGBT sense, growing up, is something that I wouldn\u0026rsquot want any other child to ever have to suffer ever again.  Black said a debate \u0026ldquohas to happen but added she did not know what the answer would be.  Meanwhile, the Glasgow University graduate also addressed questions on her unlikely rapport with Tory MP and Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg.  \"In a colleague sense, I get on fine with the guy, but his views are vile,\" Black said.  \"People need to acknowledge this guy is dangerous, because for all the manners and all the niceness, he doesn\u0027t think women should have the right to their body, he doesn\u0027t think I should be allowed to get married because I\u0027m gay.  \"That\u0027s terrifying.\""},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-dont-let-the-blind-men-of-brexit-take-us-over-the-cliff","story":"  In this summer of discontent, as Britain digs in for a Dad\u0026rsquos Army departure from the EU, complete with stockpiling food and martial law at the ports, it\u0026rsquos clear none of the options before parliament can prevail. The No-Dealers haven\u0026rsquot a clue Theresa May\u0026rsquos White Paper is toast the Labour opposition have abdicated responsibility. There\u0026rsquos no majority in parliament for another referendum.  Hence Blind Brexit. It\u0026rsquos different from No Deal in that it does involve a partial deal, that Britain will pay the \u0026pound40 billion divorce bill, recognise the rights of EU citizens and accept an Irish backstop.  There would also be a solemn and binding commitment to working for a \u0026ldquofriction-free trade agreement, which no-one would believe, but would park the issue until after Britain is clearly and finally out of the European Union.  Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, is thought to be open to this and willing to add agreements on security co-operation to any such deal in October. The Germans have denied that they favour Blind Brexit, but there does appear to be a softening of attitudes on the continent \u0026ndash or perhaps they\u0026rsquore just getting bored with the whole Brexit business.  Clearly, Theresa May\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquofacilitated customs arrangement is a non-starter. The EU can\u0026rsquot allow a country that isn\u0026rsquot a member of the customs union to collect duties. Britain could have a Canada-style free trade deal, a Norway-style EEA arrangement, which means remaining in the single market, or World Trade Rules, which (when negotiated) would mean tariffs and non-tariff barriers on goods going to the EU. Or none of the above, if you want to go the full Mogg.  May\u0026rsquos plan could, in theory, be adapted to become the European Economic Area \u0026ndash perhaps by having Britain rejoin the European Free Trade Area. EFTA was created by Britain in 1960, has its own court for settling disputes and would allow Britain to discretely join the EEA. In many ways, EFTA is the obvious solution, as even Tory Brexiteers like Daniel Hannan MEP argue. But this \u0026ldquoNorway plus model would never get past the Brexit headbangers of the Tory European Research Group of MPs. Moreover, the EEA is rejected by Jeremy Corbyn for reasons that defy explanation.  For their part, Brussels doesn\u0026rsquot want a crash-out/no-deal Brexit because it might lose the \u0026pound40 billion that Britain owes to the EU budget. A Blind Brexit in October would at least secure the EU\u0026rsquos money and the future of EU citizens. Parking Britain\u0026rsquos future trade relationship could also work rather well for the 27. Businesses like Airbus are talking about moving production to the EU. Some financial organisations already have done so, including two of Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0026rsquos investment funds, confirming that money has no shame.  But Blind Brexit would be a catastrophe for Britain. At least with No Deal there is the option of  delaying the implementation of Article 50 at the last minute. The Brussels rules allow this \u0026ndash indeed, Britain could delay its departure indefinitely. As the former EU ambassador, John Kerr, has pointed out, freezing Article 50 would allow Britain to keep its current favourable deal with the EU.  If Article 50 just doesn\u0026rsquot happen, nothing does. We remain in the European Single Market and the Customs Union and there is no border issue in Ireland. More importantly, Britain doesn\u0026rsquot lose its hard-won opt-outs from EU Treaties, such as from the single currency, or its rebates from EU budget contributions. And, unlike the EEA option, Britain retains its say in the formation of single market policies. Moreover, the \u0026ldquopower grab of devolved responsibilities, that is threatening to undermine the Scottish Parliament, would also be halted. The EU Withdrawal Bill, which has sought to repeal the 1998 Scotland Act, would be stillborn.  THE truth is that Britain already has a very good deal from the European Union negotiated over many years. It is obvious now that there\u0026rsquos no way of replicating that favourable trading status from outside the EU. The Brexiteers have failed to come up with any credible plan that doesn\u0026rsquot involve huge losses for British industry and taxpayers. Theresa May\u0026rsquos White Paper compromise keeps all the \u0026ldquobad things about being in Europe \u0026ndash the European Court, payments to Brussels, rules and regulations \u0026ndash without Britain having any say in them.  It\u0026rsquos also becoming clear that there will be the mother of all recessions when Britain leaves the EU. This is because of shrinking trade, collapsing investment, food-price inflation and the departure of migrant workers. That\u0026rsquos why the Bank of England jacked up interest rates last week. Governor Mark Carney revealed that the bank has \u0026ldquostress tested for unemployment doubling, house prices collapsing by 30 per cent, and interest rates tripling. He also pointed out that Britain has already lost two per cent of GDP because of Brexit.  This is why the Michael Goves are giving the nod to Brussels that, if they just hold off decisions on our future trading arrangements, the UK will pay them the divorce money.

Why? Because it is inconceivable in future when (and it surely will be when) Britain tries to get back into the single market, that the EU will ever offer us a deal comparable to what we\u0026rsquove just lost by leaving.

Jeremy Corbyn is no great EU enthusiast anyway, and he probably hopes that, once the post-Brexit recession hits, the backlash will propel Labour into office. It very well might. But Labour would be inheriting an economy in a death spiral, with no prospect of rectifying matters in the short term.  The Hard Brexiteers have already factored a Tory defeat into their calculations. They know that May is doomed, and that this Conservative Government will fall sooner rather than later. But they believe a short, sharp spell of Corbynomics, against a background of chaotic post-Brexit economic recession, will allow the Tories to come roaring back in five years \u0026ndash or maybe 10 \u0026ndash with a hard right-wing leadership under Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson.  This must not be allowed to happen. Britain must wake up from its Dad\u0026rsquos Army nostalgia. Labour, SNP, LibDems and Tory Remainers must get together and ensure that there\u0026rsquos no Article 50 until there\u0026rsquos a trade deal.

The No-Dealers haven\u0026rsquot a clue Theresa May\u0026rsquos White Paper is toast the Labour opposition have abdicated responsibility. There\u0026rsquos no majority in parliament for another referendum.  Hence Blind Brexit. It\u0026rsquos different from No Deal in that it does involve a partial deal, that Britain will pay the \u0026pound40 billion divorce bill, recognise the rights of EU citizens and accept an Irish backstop.  There would also be a solemn and binding commitment to working for a \u0026ldquofriction-free trade agreement, which no-one would believe, but would park the issue until after Britain is clearly and finally out of the European Union.  Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, is thought to be open to this and willing to add agreements on security co-operation to any such deal in October. The Germans have denied that they favour Blind Brexit, but there does appear to be a softening of attitudes on the continent \u0026ndash or perhaps they\u0026rsquore just getting bored with the whole Brexit business.  Clearly, Theresa May\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquofacilitated customs arrangement is a non-starter. The EU can\u0026rsquot allow a country that isn\u0026rsquot a member of the customs union to collect duties. Britain could have a Canada-style free trade deal, a Norway-style EEA arrangement, which means remaining in the single market, or World Trade Rules, which (when negotiated) would mean tariffs and non-tariff barriers on goods going to the EU. Or none of the above, if you want to go the full Mogg.  May\u0026rsquos plan could, in theory, be adapted to become the European Economic Area \u0026ndash perhaps by having Britain rejoin the European Free Trade Area. EFTA was created by Britain in 1960, has its own court for settling disputes and would allow Britain to discretely join the EEA. In many ways, EFTA is the obvious solution, as even Tory Brexiteers like Daniel Hannan MEP argue. But this \u0026ldquoNorway plus model would never get past the Brexit headbangers of the Tory European Research Group of MPs.

The Sunday Herald has learned that one of Gougeon\u0026rsquos first tasks will be to decide whether to overhaul the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act following a review by former judge Lord Bonomy which recommended strengthening the legislation.  Cabinet secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform, Roseanna Cunningham, had responsibility before Gougeon took it on.  The junior minister met stakeholders this week, including the Scottish Countryside Alliance, which is pro-hunting, and animal welfare charities the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the League Against Cruel Sports Scotland.  Gougeon, who was first elected to the Scottish Parliament in 2016, is understood to be considering how to respond to a public consultation which showed overwhelming support for reform.  Almost all of the 18,787 respondents indicated support for moves which would strengthen the 2002 law. The Bonomy review concluded that there are still \u0026ldquoaspects and features of the legislation which complicate unduly the detection, investigation and prosecution of alleged offences.  The Scottish Government analysis of the public consultation said: \u0026ldquoBetween 94 per cent and 98 per cent of respondents indicated support for or agreement with each of Lord Bonomy\u0026rsquos proposals for reform.  \u0026ldquoThese figures reflect the very large campaign response. Among the organisational respondents, animal welfare charities and campaign groups indicated support, whereas countryside management and sporting groups generally indicated opposition.  The 2002 act banned hunts from using dogs to track down and tear apart foxes. The existing legislation still allows huntsmen to use dogs to flush animals from cover before they are shot.  The Scottish Countryside Alliance has always insisted all hunts have operated within the law since the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act was passed, but animal welfare charities have gathered evidence which appears to contradict this position. The new season begins on November 1.  Robbie Marsland, director of the League Against Cruel Sports Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWith this year\u0027s hunting season getting closer, it\u0027s disappointing that we are still in the same position as previous years with a law which is highly ineffective in doing what it was intended for.  \u0026ldquoHowever, we are pleased to have a new minister tasked with progressing Bonomy\u0027s recommendations and we are keen to work productively with her to ensure that fox hunting is really banned in Scotland \u0026ndash for good.  Scottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone added: \u0026ldquoNew minister Mairi Gougeon can hit the ground running and show real commitment to animal welfare in Scotland by making this legislation fit for purpose, properly banning fox hunting for once and for all.  \u0026ldquoI will do all that I can to support her in ending this barbaric sport. Polling shows she will have the support too of the overwhelming majority of people in this country.  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to ensuring the highest welfare standards for all animals \u0026ndash including those in the wild.  \u0026ldquoAlmost 20,000 people responded to our consultation on Lord Bonomy\u0026rsquos recommendations and we have now published the consultation analysis which the newly appointed Minister for Rural Affairs and the Natural Environment Mairi Gougeon will consider before setting out next steps as part of her remit which includes animal welfare.  The Scottish Countryside Alliance did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"a-hollow-victory-the-aftermath-of-the-zimbabwe-elections","story":"  Ten years ago in the wake of a presidential election in Zimbabwe, I found myself standing in a rundown cemetery on the outskirts of the capital Harare.  I had come to find the graves of people who had died from a recent cholera outbreak that then president Robert Mugabe insisted had never happened.  According to Mugabe there was \u0026ldquono cholera in Zimbabwe even though that same day I spoke with many relatives of those who had died.  Among those that I met was Cecilia, a 70-year old woman who had come for the first time to visit the grave of her 18-year old granddaughter who had died slowly and painfully from the disease.  Cecilia\u0026rsquos family were poor, the sort who suffers most in a country with a crumbling healthcare system, economic collapse, hunger and political oppression. In Zimbabwe at that time under the iron grip of Mugabe\u0026rsquos regime, there was no shortage of painful and often violent ways to die.  Fast forward 10 years and I\u0026rsquom back in Zimbabwe, this time just before the latest presidential elections that have played out so dramatically over the past week. Once again I found myself in an impoverished township, a place called Mbare one of the biggest and oldest in Harare.  Here too poverty is rife, the uncollected refuse, overcrowding, rampant petty crime and widespread health and sanitation problems, all legacies of those years during which the Mugabe regime let Mbare and much of Zimbabwe rot.  But the mood among those Zimbabweans I met this time round has changed. Four months after Mugabe\u0026rsquos 40-year long rule was broken when he was ousted in a coup, people are looking forward to what they believe will be the country\u0026rsquos first free and fair election in decades.  That long-awaited and eagerly anticipated poll was finally run last week, but its outcome has done little to heal the wounds in a country still deeply divided and living in the shadow of its authoritarian past.  After days of bitter claims and counter-claims, incumbent president Emmerson Mnangagwa, the 75-year-old former spy chief, nicknamed \u0026lsquothe crocodile,\u0026rsquo secured a comfortable victory for his Zanu-PF party, polling 50.8 per cent of the votes.  His main rival 40-year-old opposition leader Nelson Chamisa of the MDC Alliance gained 44.3 per cent of the ballot. Mnangagwa\u0026rsquos majority thus avoided a run-off.  Overall Zanu-PF kept its parliamentary majority with 144 of 210 seats while the MDC won 64.  Voter turnout overall was high at more than 75 per cent, reflecting the hope of Zimbabweans that the election would be fair. Many of those monitoring the ballot, however, believe it wasn\u0026rsquot.  European Union observers cited \u0026ldquomisuse of state resources, instances of coercion and intimidation, partisan behaviour by traditional leaders and overt bias in state media, all to the Zanu-PF\u0026rsquos advantage. Security forces meanwhile raided opposition headquarters and broke up a press conference at a Harare hotel on Friday.  The same day Mnangagwa did his best to sound a conciliatory note after six people were killed in a post-election crackdown by the military. He vowed to be president for all Zimbabweans and declared his rival Chamisa would have a vital role to perform in Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos future.  \u0026ldquoTo Nelson Chamisa, I want to say: you have a crucial role to play in Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos present and its unfolding future. Let us both call for peace and unity in our land, Mnangagwa appealed.  But Chamisa in his first public appearance since Mnangagwa was declared election winner early on Friday morning, told reporters Mnangagwa\u0026rsquos ruling Zanu-PF had authorised the army crackdown on opposition supporters because it knew it had lost the election.  \u0026ldquoMr Mnangagwa did not win the election in this country \u0026hellip we won this election emphatically, Chamisa said. \u0026ldquoIf you go around the country you will find no celebration. This is a black day for democracy. We are seeing a repeat of the last regime.  Chamisa went on to insist that he and his supporters would \u0026ldquoexplore all necessary means, legal and constitutional, to ensure that the will of the people is protected.  Zimbabwe\u0027s constitution does allow for a legal challenge to the results, but Chamisa now has the huge task of proving in court with hard evidence what until now have only been claims and accusations.  In Harare, however, many MDC supporters appeared resigned to the result and unwilling to take to the streets to protest, perhaps fearing another crackdown by the police and army.  Meanwhilethe continuing war of words between the two leaders bodes ill for Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos future political direction, one being watched carefully by its African neighbours and the wider international community.  Hoping to attract renewed investment from the West, Mnangagwa worked during the election campaign to moderate his image with a message that Zimbabwe was embracing democracy and human rights.  Some critics though have seen his election as little more than an extension of Mugabe\u0026rsquos long rule. Mnangagwa, they point out was Mugabe\u0026rsquos right-hand man and behind some of his most repressive policies.  Already the heavy-handed response towards protesters has raised questions over who could have ordered the army on to the streets last week and who is really running the government.  Some election observers say that the army\u0026rsquos deployment and the repression used has shot a hole in the government\u0026rsquos claims that Zimbabwe has thrown off its authoritarian past. Mnangagwa\u0026rsquos government is nothing more than a military junta in disguise some claim. They point to Constantino Chiwenga, the military leader of last November\u0026rsquos coup that ended Mugabe\u0026rsquos rule as the man who is really in charge.  \u0026ldquoThe government still has a military core and a military ethos, was how Zimbabwe expert Stephen Chan, of London University\u0026rsquos School of Oriental and African Studies, summed up the situation.  \u0026ldquoHow can you be so goddam clumsy? You\u0026rsquove gone to all this trouble to stage manage this stuff and you\u0026rsquove just gone and shot yourself in the foot, Chan wryly observed about Mnangagwa\u0026rsquos handling of the election and subsequent protests in Harare last week. Mnangagwa\u0026rsquos spat with Chamisa aside, his victory could prove hollow in other ways too.  As the country\u0026rsquos leader he will have to administer an economy in meltdown after two decades of misrule and corruption under Mugabe and a near bankrupt Treasury that\u0026rsquos unable to service its loans or take out new ones. All this will leave Mnangagwa little scope to improve government services, rebuild crumbling transport links and meet a plethora of other election pledges.  The challenges the president faces are all too obvious to any visitor to the country. Some districts in the capital Harare, a sprawling, run-down city of about 4 million people haven\u0026rsquot had running water for years. Raw sewage leaks from burst pipes that go unfixed for weeks at a time and long stretches of tarmac roads have been reduced to rutted tracks. Harare city council estimates it needs $10 billion to repair infrastructure and attend to its maintenance backlog.  Time and again while in Zimbabwe in the run up to the elections, I listened to government officials repeat the political mantra that Zimbabwe was now \u0026ldquoopen for business.  The bad old days of authoritarian rule they insisted were now behind the country.  But on Friday on Harare\u0026rsquos streets it was police officers in vehicles with mounted loudspeakers that toured the city\u0026rsquos streets reassuring shopkeepers.  \u0026ldquoZimbabwe is open for business. We are here to protect you. Feel free to walk and open your business. All is well, fear not, the officers insisted.  It was all a far cry from the positive tone of the government\u0026rsquos message in the run up to the election.  \u0026ldquoThis has blown the slogan \u0026lsquoOpen for Business\u0026rsquo into smoke, Ibbo Mandaza, a political analyst and a former member of the ruling Zanu-PF, told the Financial Times last week.  \u0026ldquoThe consensus now is that engagement with the west is a very far-off prospect, he said, citing discussions with foreign observers and diplomats shocked at the violent turn the elections had taken.  Mnangagwa faces no end of other problems too, not least the country\u0026rsquos currency crisis. Some time ago the government introduced bond notes, a dollar-backed quasi-currency, to ease Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos liquidity crisis, but the effect has been marginal.  Today more than 98 per cent of transactions are conducted via bank and other transfers and dollar bills are worth as much as 80 per cent more that their electronic equivalent.  But the financial problems go even deeper. According to research by Bloomberg business news, the government currently has about 350,000 employees whose wages gobble up almost the entire national budget. It also owns about 100 companies, most of which are cash-strapped and dysfunctional.  Zimbabwe is also saddled with $1.7 billion of arrears owed to the African Development Bank and World Bank that it needs to clear before it can tap new loans from multilateral lenders.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove heard lots of talk about being open for business, but nothing tangible to attract business, John Robertson, an independent economist based in Harare told Bloomberg. \u0026ldquoAs things stand, it\u0026rsquos cheaper to import products than manufacture them locally because of the very high production costs.  All of this is being carefully noted and monitored by current and potential future investors in Zimbabwe.  Earlier this year in Harare, the European Union\u0026rsquos Commissioner for International Development, Neven Mimica, signed an agreement with Zimbabwean officials that saw new EU-funded programmes worth \u0026pound20 million launched to improve people\u0026rsquos access to health services and enhance their livelihoods.  I asked Mr Mimica at the time whether such future funding might be reconsidered should Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos election fail to be free and transparent and any future administration not live up to the democratic terms laid down as conditions.  \u0026ldquoThe EU has always been a reliable partner of the Zimbabwean people, and it stands ready to accompany Zimbabwe in its process of change, said Mr Mimica  \u0026ldquoWe do not want to be a passive partner in this process, he added, stressing that the EU and others were watching Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos impending elections carefully and that reforms must be made and checks carried out that such a process is under way for EU financial support to be maintained.  Given events surrounding the election last week Mimica\u0026rsquos words have taken on a fresh and imperative resonance. Whether Zimbabwe is on a genuinely new course remains far from certain. To that end president Mnangagwa will be closely scrutinised by many within the international community.  \u0026ldquoIf Mnangagwa is serious about reform, he must also repeal laws giving the government power to toss political opponents in jail and crack down on public protests as well as Mugabe-era legislation designed to roll back civil liberties, quash independent journalism, thwart the rule of law, and criminalise speech critical of the president, observed Siphosami Malunga, executive director of the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa.  \u0026ldquoAs long as those statutes are on the books, the government can use them to silence critics and opponents, Malunga added in an article published just before the election.  Democratic change in Zimbabwe is undoubtedly possible. For the moment though the hopes of ordinary Zimbabweans have been tempered yet again by the forces arrayed against it and the determination of some to hold on to power. The weeks and months ahead will be another uncertain and difficult period for this long-suffering African nation."},{"url":null,"title":"prince-charles-backs-highland-games-for-children","story":"  Prince Charles\u0027 charity The Prince\u0026rsquos Foundation is behind a project to establish links with local schools to promote the practice of traditional highland sports amongst youngsters in the north of Scotland.

Owners of empty homes are being encouraged to bring them back into use, with measures including legislative changes, provision of funding and practical advice and assistance, the Scottish Government has said.  However the Scottish Liberal Democrats contrasted the figure provided by Mr Stewart with statistics on the number of long-term vacant private sector homes, which totalled more than 20,000 across Scotland at January 2018.  The party said it would take more than 50 years to refurbish the existing backlog at the same rate of progress since 2010.  The Lib Dems called for efforts to bring properties back into use to be fast-tracked, pointing to the cost difference between doing so and building new homes.  The Scottish Empty Homes Partnership says it costs between \u0026pound6,000 and \u0026pound25,000 to refurbish an empty home, compared with the average \u0026pound100,000 new-build cost, with the added benefit that the infrastructure and local services are already in place, the party said.  Data gathered using freedom of information requests to local authorities showed that at January 2018, there were 20,027 private sector homes which had been vacant for six months or more.  Of these, 5,583 were vacant for more than two years and 2,053 were vacant for more than five years.  Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said: \"The Scottish Government should fast-track new efforts to get these properties back into use and introduce a new help-to-renovate loan to get existing vacant properties up to scratch.  \"With the right incentives and help, many of these could be resurrected to help alleviate the housing crisis, tackle homelessness and give young people a better chance of a home to call their own.\"  Mr Stewart said: \"Privately-owned empty homes can be a blight on communities and are a wasted resource.  \"Such homes can become empty for a number of reasons, which is why tailored individual support and advice for owners of these properties from local empty homes officers across the country is often the most effective way of bringing these homes back into use.  \"We recently doubled funding for the Scottish Empty Homes Partnership and network of empty homes officers. The dedicated support and advice provided has helped return 742 homes back into use in the last year, bringing the total to more than 3,200 since 2010.  \"In addition we are on track to deliver 50,000 affordable homes this term and are proud of our delivery of over 72,500 homes since 2007.\""},{"url":null,"title":"facebook-starts-testing-dating-service-internally","story":"  The social network, which announced plans to enter the dating business during its F8 conference in May, regularly tests new features internally ahead of launch to iron out any bugs.

He said the government of an independent Scotland should therefore charge the Ministry of Defence around \u0026pound1bn a year to keep the weapons north of the border.  The timetable, which is four times the one in the SNP\u0026rsquos 2014 independence plans, is likely to anger party activists committed to the rapid removal of Trident.  With Nicola Sturgeon considering whether to press for a second independence referendum in light of Brexit, the SNP is currently updating its prospectus for life outside the UK.  However to date the party\u0026rsquos efforts have focused on the economic case for independence.  Mr Crawford told Scotland on Sunday an independent Scotland could not sensibly demand Trident\u0027s removal from the Clyde for many years after independence.  Although there are other potential homes for the submarine fleet, including Devonport and Barrow-in-Furness, nowhere else in the UK has the equivalent of Faslane\u0026rsquos sister site at Coulport, where missile warheads are stored.  The issue is not new - indeed, many in the SNP see the lack of an alternative base as a way for independence to force the UK to abandon its nuclear deterrent.  However Mr Crawford, a former army officer who previously advised the SNP on defence and is publishing a paper on the subject in the autumn, said the party hard to be practical about Trident.  He said: \u0026ldquoAn independent Scotland cannot really sensibly insist on removal of the UK\u0026rsquos nuclear deterrent from its waters in the short to medium term.  \u0026ldquoTherefore some pragmatic solution has to be adopted. The pragmatic solution is, in my opinion, to rent the Faslane nuclear facilities to the rest of the UK until such time as some other arrangement can be brought about.  \u0026ldquoIf there is any chance of Scotland becoming an independent country in 2021, it would take the UK government at least 20 years to build the equivalent to the Faslane/Coulport facilities elsewhere in the UK.\" The White Paper on independence published by then First Minister Alex Salmond said Trident could be gone within five years.  It said: \u0026ldquoFollowing a vote for independence, we would make early agreement on the speediest safe removal of nuclear weapons a priority. This would be with a view to the removal of Trident within the first term of the Scottish Parliament following independence.  Mr Crawford said: \u0026ldquoIt is the most emotive defence-related issue in the whole independence debate.  \"The difficult thing for the SNP leadership would be selling this to the foot soldiers. The broad base of the independence movement is very much grounded in the CND movement. I am completely sympathetic to that.  \u0026ldquoThe SNP Government might look at this plan and say it doesn\u0026rsquot deliver our promise to remove Trident, but it would be the biggest bargaining chip that an independent Scotland could have.  Tory MSP Douglas Ross said: \u0026ldquoThese comments add an element of realism to the SNP\u0026rsquos defence policy for an independent Scotland. However, the idea of the UK\u0026rsquos nuclear deterrent remaining on the Clyde for 20 years would not sit well with many rank and file nationalists. \u0026ldquoIt was never credible to think that Trident would just disappear from the Clyde following a Yes vote. There are thousands of Scottish jobs that depend on it. This is another example of policy and decision-making being driven by political dogma and the SNP\u0026rsquos obsession for separation at any cost.  An SNP spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP does not support Trident either as part of the UK or in an independent Scotland. We have continually opposed the renewal of Trident at the cost of conventional and cyber defences and continue to do so.  \u0026ldquoIn 2014 the Scottish Government set out a responsible approach to the removal of Trident from Scotland and in the event of independence securing the speediest and safest withdrawal of nuclear weapons would be a priority for an SNP Scottish Government."},{"url":null,"title":"no-deal-brexit-now-likeliest-outcome-says-liam-fox","story":"  Brexiter Dr Liam Fox said the odds of a no-deal Brexit had risen to 60-40, and blamed European \u0026ldquointransigence for failing to accept the UK\u0026rsquos unprecedented plans for leaving.  Opposition parties said he was trying to blame others for a mess of his own making, and warned it would be a disaster for the UK to crash out of Europe without a trade and customs relationship with the continent.  Official contingency plans suggest a no deal Brexit could choke ports, create food and medicine shortages, lead to social unrest and torpedo the economy.  Downing Street said it was \u0026ldquoconfident of a good deal, but did not disown Dr Fox\u0026rsquos remarks, which chime with its effort to sell Theresa May\u0026rsquos Chequers plan for a soft Brexit in Europe.  Last week, as part of a Cabinet drive to concentrate minds across the Channel, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned the UK and EU were heading a for no deal \u0026ldquoby accident.  Mrs May also interrupted her holiday to meet France\u0026rsquos President Macron to discuss it.  Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos top negotiator, last week trashed key parts of the Chequers plan, saying it tried to cherry pick parts of long-standing trade and customs arrangements.  Dr Fox said Mr Barnier\u0026rsquos had dismissed the proposal, which has split the Tories, simply because \"we have never done it before\", making \u0026ldquothe chance of no deal greater.  He told the Sunday Times: \u0026ldquoI think the intransigence of the [European] Commission is pushing us towards no deal. We have set out the basis in which a deal can happen.  \u0026ldquoBut if the EU decides that the theological obsession of the unelected is to take priority over the economic wellbeing of the people of Europe then it\u0027s a bureaucrats\u0027 Brexit - not a people\u0027s Brexit - then there is only going to be one outcome.\"  He said that if the EU didn\u0026rsquot like the Chequers plan it was down to them to offer one \u0026ldquoacceptable to us.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos up to the EU 27 to determine whether they want the EU Commission\u0026rsquos theological purity to be maintained at the expense of their real economies.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos essential that no deal looks creible to the EU.  In July 2017, Dr Fox said EU-UK legal and regulatory alignment made a deal easy.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe free trade agreement that we will have to do with the European Union should be one of the easiest in human history. We don\u0026rsquot want to have no deal. It is much better that we have a deal than no deal. We can of course survive with no deal.  Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned on Friday the odds of no-deal were \u0026ldquouncomfortably high, sparking a fall in the value of the pound.  Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said no deal would be \u0026ldquoa catastrophic failure of government, which no government should survive, and MPs had a duty to prevent it.  He blamed Mrs may\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoreckless red lines on leaving the single market, customs union and European Court of Justice, Tory divisions and \u0026ldquofantasy Brexiteer promises.  SNP Brexit Secretary Michael Russell tweeted about Dr Fox: \u0026ldquoIt is not astonishing (given his political track record) but it is deeply worrying that he understands so little about the EU.  SNP foreign affairs spokesperson Stephen Gethins MP said: \u0026ldquoFirst it was Jeremy Hunt, then Mark Carney, and now Liam Fox is saying we are likely facing a \u0026lsquono-deal\u0026rsquo scenario when the UK leaves the EU.  \u0026ldquoThe Tory government\u0026rsquos chaotic handling of the Brexit negotiations, and its ideological red lines, have resulted in small and large businesses already having one foot out the door.  \u0026ldquoWith eight months left before the self-imposed Brexit date, the UK government must commit to remaining in the single market and customs union. There is still time for the government to take a step back and work with the business community and devolved governments to pursue an outcome that safeguards our economy, jobs and living standards.\"  Former Tory minister Priti Patel said Mrs May may should ditch the Chequers plan, which would maintain a \u0026ldquocommon rule book on goods and agri-foods.  The Brexiter MP said it did not fulfill the referendum result and would \u0026ldquoleave us half-in and half-out, still bound to EU regulations and constraints.  In a swipe at the PM, she said \u0026ldquopolitical courage, the kind of courage that appears to have been lacking over the past two years, was required to deliver a loose frade trade deal.  Ina newspaper article, former Labour Home Secretary Lord Blunkett said people who voted Leave over immigration concerns were not \u0026ldquoracist, but had been issuing a \u0026ldquocry for help about the state of the political system and the aftermath of the financial crash on their lives.

The bench, which would have been used by many a passenger at the old station before its closure in 1964, was recently discovered at auction and has now been secured for the project by Aberdeenshire Council and regional transport partnership Nestrans.                                                    It is hoped that following its refurbishment the bench will form part of the new station, providing a tangible link to the station’s history which was a strong theme from earlier consultation with the community.                                                    The project team are also keen to involve local organisations in the restoration work, with support already provided by haulage firm ARR Craib who assisted with transport of the bench.        The news comes soon after plans for the wider Kintore Rail Station project took a significant step forward with planning permission now granted for the platform, car park and access road. Councillor Peter Argyle, who is chair of Nestrans, deputy leader of Aberdeenshire Council and chair of their Infrastructure Services Committee, said: “I am very pleased to see the progress that has been made on the development of the station. “The discovery of the bench is most opportune and a fantastic way to involve the community and recognise their desire to see local history reflected in the new development. I look forward to seeing the bench renovated and on site at the new station.”Councillor Martin Ford, who is a member of the Garioch Area Committee and a substitute member for the Nestrans board, had highlighted the historical find at auction and added: “I am delighted that the bench has been secured and will form a point of historical interest at the new station.                                                                                                         “The area where the new station is sited has deep historical roots in transportation, going back prior to the 1800s, and you can see various signs and markers of its time as a Turnpike Road and a canal route. Whilst we do not know the exact age of the bench, it seems fitting that we can continue this tradition and link the new station back to the former site, which opened in the 1850s.” The station project is jointly funded by Aberdeenshire Council, Nestrans, and Transport Scotland via the Scottish Stations Fund, with support from Network Rail and ScotRail. It will see the construction of new station platforms, lifts/overbridge, passenger waiting shelters, a new access road, a 160 space car park, a pedestrian and cycle path and secure cycle parking facilities.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Sunday 5 Aug 2018 6:41 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

People with physical, vision and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete.\u0026ldquoThis is a golden opportunity for local groups, individuals and businesses to raise awareness to their cause and raise funds from their stalls on the day, he said. \u0026ldquoWe are hoping the event will showcase Caithness in a positive way for tourism, business and the community.Sixty para-athletes will travel from as far afield as America and Australia and all over the UK to take part in the milestone event. The Mey Games will be unique as it welcomes both para and Invictus athletes to compete in traditional Highland track-and-field competitions. This will be the first time that para-athletics has been included within a traditional Highland Games context in Scotland.America\u0026rsquos Alex \u0026ldquoThe Tank Armor, who holds the world record for wheelchair caber-tossing, as well as several top Australian para-athletes will be competing.Last year saw a revamped games event held at John O\u0026rsquoGroats, with Prince Charles \u0026ndash known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland \u0026ndash in attendance.The duke \u0026ndash whose late grandmother, the Queen Mother, regularly attended the games during her summer stays at the Castle of Mey \u0026ndash did an impromptu tour of the various marquees on the site to chat with local organisations and vendors.Capt Otley \u0026ndash who is also chairman of the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of Royal British Legion Scotland (RBLS) \u0026ndash said that all proceeds from the games will be going towards supporting the veterans and their families within the branch area. There will be in the region of 15 marquees this year, including seven new ones as a result of successful applications to local community benefit funds.\u0026ldquoThe Mey Games is now a major annual event in Caithness, Capt Otley said.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos organised by the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of the RBLS who took on the running of the games when visitor numbers were dwindling to as low as just 30. Last year, we had 1500 visitors and this year we hope to welcome between 2500 and 3500 people.\u0026ldquoWe are all volunteers and work hard to ensure the event is a big success.

But we are aware that this could cause difficulties for some community groups and we are asking for views on the sort of events where we should consider waiving a kitchen charge. An example of this might be an event to raise funds for the local community.”The council has said the budget simulator exercise they carried out in 2016 demonstrated a willingness among the public for an increase in charges for services if this helped reduce the need for cuts to frontline services.Initial discussions on the possibility of charging for the use of community school kitchens have been held with the chairs of many of Orkney’s community associations, who will be contacted again and asked for further feedback — including suggestions for the types of events that should be excluded from a kitchen hire charge.Other groups and individuals can also provide views and ideas by sending an email to education.leisure@orkney.gov.uk  or writing to Community Learning and Development, Council Offices, School Place, Kirkwall, Orkney KW15 1NY.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Where vacancies are going to occur, boards are already planning their recruitment processes and keeping us updated on the progress. There are absolutely no plans to merge health boards.”Orkney MSP Liam McArthur also spoke out in response to the reports, emphasising the need to consider the repercussions for island health boards.He said: “Patients in Orkney and Shetland rely heavily on these mainland boards, particularly NHS Grampian, for specialist treatment and care. Any proposals to merge NHS Grampian, NHS Highland and NHS Tayside, therefore, must take full account of the impact on island health boards.“Traditionally, rural and island communities have not fared well from the centralisation of services.

The ONWP is keen that people come along to find out more, and specifically what will be happening in Orkney.The events are open to the public, and it’s hoped that Orkney’s landowners will attend. Additional events will be held on the islands that Macca and Angela will be working on.The ONWP, which is a partnership between Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and RSPB Scotland, aims to protect Orkney’s native wildlife by removing stoats, an invasive non-native predator that was first recorded in Orkney in 2010.Since 2010, stoats have spread and established across Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.There have also been a handful of sightings reported on other islands including Hoy and, most recently, Shapinsay. Traps and motion-activated cameras have been used to try to determine whether stoats are present on these other islands following possible sightings. However, the presence or absence of stoats on all “high-risk” islands must be determined before the eradication programme to remove stoats can commence.Stoats are notoriously difficult to detect particularly when they are at low densities. Therefore, the only way to be certain that stoats are not present is to use specially-trained dogs to systematically search for signs and scent of stoats.Plans are in place to train six dogs as part of the main project, but, as they take years of training, Macca has been brought in from New Zealand to help confirm the presence or absence of stoats on islands that are at high-risk from stoat invasion due to their proximity to Mainland Orkney.High-risk islands are those that are within a swimmable distance of islands where stoats are established. Stoats can swim considerable distances (at least 3 km) over open water.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This puts the institution two per cent above the Scottish average.UHI has also performed above the Scottish sector in almost all measures and this high level of student satisfaction can be found across all areas of the partnership.Dr Iain Morrison, dean of students, said: “This wonderful result has been achieved through cohesive, coordinated and collective efforts by many people across the partnership.

track","story":"\u0026nbspMULTI-million pound efforts to improve water supplies in Ross-shire have been welcomed by a local MP.Jamie Stone visited a Scottish Water site near Evanton this week to view progress on a \u0026pound5.5 million project to improve security of the water supply for customers across much of Easter Ross and beyond.Work at the site has been underway since February this year and is expected to be complete in early 2019.A new tank is being built with a capacity to store up to eight million litres of drinking water, improving security of supply for around 30,000 customers across Easter Ross, Dingwall and the Black Isle.The work is being carried out by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD, in partnership with contractor Coffey Construction.After seeing the work in progress and receiving an update on Scottish Water\u0026rsquos current work across his Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross constituency, Mr Stone said: \"The long period of dry weather this summer is a reminder that, even in the Highlands, water is a precious resource that we all rely on in countless ways.\"The work currently taking place will help to improve the security of water supply for Easter Ross in the event of any future issues at the water treatment works or disruption to the local water network.\u0026nbsp\"At the same time, it is good to hear of the work Scottish Water\u0026rsquos operational teams are currently carrying out across the north to maintain supplies and protect the local environment.\"Despite some recent rainfall, it is still important that we use water wisely to help lochs and reservoirs recover so that supplies can be maintained through the rest of the summer and beyond,\" he added.ESD project manager Kevin Williamson said the works remained on track for completion next year.He said: \"The work we are delivering reflects a significant investment for one of the key water supply areas in the Highlands, which serves communities right around the Cromarty Firth.\"Work on site is going well and we anticipate it will be complete early next year.\u0026nbsp\"Once in place, the new storage tank will give Scottish Water improved ability to carry out important maintenance work at the water treatment works, and deal with any short term issues affecting the local water network, without impact on customers\u0026rsquo water supply.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMeanwhile, Scottish Water has urged customers to do what they can to conserve water amidst this year\u0026rsquos very dry summer.Its strategic customer service planning team Leader for the north, Jim Briggs, said: \"Separately from this longer term investment, we are continuing work in consultation with Sepa to manage water resources across the north following the prolonged period of dry weather.\"Despite some rainfall in many areas over the past week, our frontline teams are continuing to work hard to ensure we can maintain supplies to all of our customers.\"We continue to need customers to help us by using water wisely, for example by using a watering can instead of a hose in the garden and only using dishwashers and washing machines when fully loaded.\u0026nbsp\"The support of thousands of customers with these small and simple steps can make a big difference to maintaining water supplies for everyone and allowing water resources to recover when rainfall occurs.\"He added that the Evanton project will help to provide \"clear, fresh-tasting drinking water to our customers in a wide range of circumstances\".Sunday 5 Aug 2018 6:42

I spoke to Cockburns and they came forward and agreed that we could have the kit fitted.\"Cockburns was the first business that we approached because we were looking for somewhere in the West End.\"The timing was just great because literally the day after they agreed to do it a nationwide campaign was launched for butchers to do the same thing \u0026ndash so Cockburns have spearheaded things.\"He added: \"This equipment is so valuable.\"Somebody that collapses outside of hospital has a six per cent chance of survival but when you have one of these kits available it can go up to around 70 per cent.\"The bank\u0026rsquos generous donation is also expected to pay for kits to be fitted in Inverness, Thurso and Kirkwall.Lucky2BeHere has a strong network of volunteer defibrillator trainers across the Highlands and Islands.It has fundraised for around 200 units so far and Dingwall now has one at the primary school, outside Castle Street Church of Scotland and Highland Council\u0026rsquos Ross House building in High Street.There are other kits in various places around Ross-shire including Contin Village Stores.And another unit is due to be fitted outside Alness Pharmacy within the next month.A nationwide campaign called \"Butchers at the Heart of the Community\" is now encouraging butchers to display collection tins in their shop in an effort to raise money for a local defibrillator.More than 30 Scottish butchers have signed up to the scheme so far, with hopes that further shops will follow suit in the future.Sunday 5 Aug 2018 6:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The disastrous roll-out of universal credit that was piloted in the Highlands has resulted in vast swathes of unnecessary suffering.\"Folk, many of whom are working, are being driven into destitution and families are being left with no choice but to rely on foodbanks.\u0026nbsp\"These are political choices and it\u0026rsquos high time those in power in Westminster took responsibility for the unnecessary suffering they are causing to folk in the Highlands, and indeed across the UK.\"Ms Todd and fellow SNP MSP Kate Forbes have now opened up their office for use as a food drop-off point in a bid to encourage more Ross-shire residents to donate as organisations struggle to keep up with demand.The kind-hearted pair said constituents will be able to leave food parcels, containing non-perishable items including pasta, rice and coffee, at their office in Dingwall High Street.And they have teamed up with Blythswood Care, which runs the Highland foodbank network, in response to the news that the number of children using the Dingwall site has risen by more than 50 per cent. The facility has also been appealing for extra donations to meet demand.\"When we saw the recent plea for food bank donations, we thought this was something we could do to help,\" Ms Forbes said. \"For the first six months of the year, 40 children have received food parcels from the Dingwall food bank, which is more than a 50 per cent increase on the previous year. This is deeply concerning.\"Across the Highlands there is a 10 per cent year-on-year rise in the number of adults receiving food parcels, whilst the number is over 25 per cent for children.\"It\u0026rsquos a sign of the times that people are dependent on food donations in a rich country \u0026ndash and an indictment on welfare reform which has left people with no other choices.\"Although the total number of people across the Highlands and the number of children using food banks have both risen, the number of adults being referred to the Dingwall food bank has fallen.Blythswood Care\u0026rsquos projects manager Finlay Mackenzie spoke of his gratitude to the two MSPs for opening their office for donations.He believes families who normally receive additional support during the school term need more help during the summer holidays.He said: \"Sadly we see an increase in referrals to our food banks across the Highlands year on year.\"This summer there has been an even greater need with many families needing extra support who would usually receive free school meals and have children who attend breakfast clubs.\"Food donations usually drop during the summer but with media support we have been very encouraged by the generous donations by the public.\"We are very grateful for the support and involvement of Kate Forbes MSP and Maree Todd MSP whose backing helps to highlight the plight of local people in times of crisis.\"Sunday 5 Aug 2018 6:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Local business figures have warned that caution should be taken when analysing the figures.David Richardson, Highlands and Islands development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, believes the area\u0026rsquos vast size and sparse population must be taken into account.\"Before discussing the Highlands position in the rather grisly league table one must first ask whether deaths per 10,000 people is a fair measurement,\" he said.\"The Highlands\u0026rsquo enormous size, tiny and highly dispersed population, and relatively poor public transport provision means that people here are more dependent on cars than in many other parts of the UK.\"If comparisons are being made then deaths per mile of road should perhaps be given too.\"Moreover, for much of the year the local population is massively boosted by visitors. I understand that visitors are included in the road death figures but not in the population figures, and presumably this significantly skews the results.\u0026nbsp\"Whatever the case, all deaths and injuries on roads are tragedies and it is of the utmost importance that our road network is fit for purpose for all: locals, business users, and visitors alike.\"FSB has called for increased investment for many years now, and while Highland Council\u0026rsquos recent announcement that it is allocating an additional \u0026pound1.5 million to road upgrades is extremely welcome, one has to ask if it is enough.\"Sunday 5 Aug 2018 6:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Sue Palmer, chair of Upstart Scotland, the children’s educational campaigning charity, wants a “kindergarten” stage from ages three to seven.            The final kindergarten year would be completed in Primary 1 – involving establishing a new starting age of six for pupils.            Nordic-style kindergarten puts emphasis on lots of play, especially outdoors, with non-formal sessions in subjects such as art, drama, music, science and maths investigations, and story-telling. Pupils wanting to do reading and writing are helped with this too.Palmer, a former primary head teacher, whose charity launched the “Play Not Tests at P1” campaign in April, made her plea as it emerged last week that teachers and parents were reporting many Primary 1 pupils were suffering stress and severe anxiety resulting from Scottish National Standardised Assessment (SNSA) tests implemented by the Scottish Government to gather data.“All the research I’ve seen very clearly shows our children should not be put under these pressures,” said Palmer, author of education research books Toxic Childhood, 21st Century Boys and Upstart.“Indeed, countries with a later starting age achieve better results in the long run. Those starting school at seven very quickly catch up.”Only 12 per cent of countries have a primary starting age of five. It is age six for 66 per cent and age seven for 22 per cent.            Palmer said: “In a kindergarten children are outside and free to move around, not under authoritative control. They learn self-regulating skills, how to focus and control their behaviour.”She said she was not against assessment and supported the aims of the curriculum for excellence, but believed it had been damaged by the Scottish Government’s drive for data collection.A spokesman for the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union said: “The EIS AGM agreed last year to investigate the opportunities and challenges associated with a change to the school starting age through a possible move to a kindergarten model of early years education.“This work is ongoing, and we will be seeking the views of our members in early years and primary establishments as part of this process.”            The spokesman added the EIS had consistently recently raised concerns over the educational value of SNSAs and recently shared this with the Scottish Government. The union is to discuss it further with EIS members when term resumes.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: “Scottish primary schools have seen a significant shift in recent years towards a play-based approach to learning.“Indeed this has been enshrined in the curriculum guidance that supports teachers in making sure play is a key part of the early years of primary school.“We are clear this approach to delivering play-based learning builds on the strength of Scottish education rather than any shift in the age at which children start school.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4777263.1533199292!/image/image.jpg","title":"motor dealer eastern revs up with barnetts takeover","story":"        Scotland\u0026#8217s motor retail industry has seen further consolidation after Eastern Western Motor Group struck a deal to acquire rival Barnetts.                Eastern Western – one of the country’s biggest players – has purchased the entire share capital of Barnetts Motor Group, which represents Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo from a large single site in Dundee and also Volkswagen in St Andrews.            No financial details have been disclosed for what is likely to have been a fairly substantial multi-million-pound deal.            The Barnetts business generated sales of £65.3 million last year and returned a £1.3m pre-tax profit.The Volvo franchise will be transferred to the John Clark Motor Group, as revealed earlier this week, and in turn Eastern Western Motor Group acquires the Nissan businesses in Dundee and Perth. Nissan in Dundee will be rehoused in the showroom vacated by Volvo.Douglas Brown, group managing director of Eastern Holdings, Eastern Western Motor Group’s parent company, said: “We have known Paul Barnett for many years and as a result it has been a quick, professional and seamless transaction.“Barnetts Motor Group and the Nissan franchises in Dundee and Perth will be a great addition to the Eastern Western Motor Group. It will give further depth and scale to our existing business and increase our points of representation of these franchises to five Nissan, four Volkswagen and two Mazda.“Similar to our recent acquisitions of Grassicks BMW and Mini in Perth and Phoenix Honda in Stirling, this further cements our relationship with three of our key partners and is in line with our strategy of growing and developing the group with existing brand partners in new geographical territories.            “We look forward to welcoming Barnetts’ teams and our new Nissan teams to the group and we will continue to trade under the Barnetts name in Dundee and St Andrews as it is synonymous with quality and excellent customer service. Nissan in Perth will trade as Western Nissan.”Barnetts Motor Group was formed when its first Volvo dealership was opened in Seagate in the early 1960s. The company has grown steadily and now employs 150 people throughout Tayside and Fife selling more than 4,000 vehicles every year and carrying out in excess of 25,000 services annually.It is understood that Paul Barnett will turn his focus to further developing the family’s property interests through Barnetts Properties.Eastern Western represents 12 franchises – Mercedes-Benz cars, Smart, Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicles, BMW, Mini, Lexus, Volkswagen, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mazda and Harley-Davidson."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4778904.1533400957!/image/image.jpg","title":"alarm at rise in six figure golden goodbyes at scots councils","story":"        A rising number of high earners in Town Halls across Scotland have received six-figure \u0026#8220golden goodbye\u0026#8221 pay-offs, prompting questions about whether taxpayers are receiving \u0026#8220value for money\u0026#8221.                More than £135 million was shelled out by Scotland’s councils over the past two years. Hundreds of workers benefited from overall packages worth more than £100,000.            The rise in staff securing the most lucrative deals comes despite a fall in the total of cash paid out. A total of £67.1m was paid out by councils across Scotland in 2017/18, local authority annual accounts reveal. This is down from £72.7m in 2016/17. But the number of staff benefiting from lucrative six-figure deals has gone up from 152 to 171. This includes individual packages of up to £250,000.            Tory local government spokesman Alexander Stewart said: “This is a staggering amount of money to be spent on golden goodbyes. “Despite councils’ budgets continually being squeezed, it beggars belief that the amount of six-figure sums paid out have significantly increased. They often contest that their amounts are reducing. However in this long-running saga, they are not decreasing nearly quickly enough and this calls into question as to whether councils are receiving value for money.“Whilst some of these decisions can ultimately save money in the long-term, we must always ensure that public funds are being spent in a sensible manner.”Fife – the country’s third biggest council – had the highest overall exit package cost in Scotland with £11.7m paid out in total, while 34 staff enjoyed six-figure deals.Eileen Rowand, executive director at Fife Council, said the authority’s workforce had been reduced by around 12 per cent since 2010 on a “planned” basis.            “To meet the continuing financial pressures over the last few years, the council has improved efficiency, while minimising the impact of any reductions on frontline services,” she said.“We have reduced our workforce by around 12 per cent since 2010 on a planned and phased basis, and we know our overall workforce will continue to shrink. However, we have also invested in growth areas such as early years, where additional posts have been created to allow increased provision for pre-school children.“Exit package costs are incurred through retirements as well as redundancy. They’re subject to scrutiny and strict controls to make sure we reduce workforce costs and generate future savings. Although the costs are significant, it should be noted that not all of this is payable to the employee. A proportion is used to offset any impact on the pension fund in line with early retirement policy.” Aberdeen was next with overall costs of £11.3m, while 38 workers enjoyed packages worth more than £100,000.            Renfrewshire paid out £6.2m in exit deals as 25 staff left with six-figure packages.A Renfrewshire Council spokesperson said: “Voluntary redundancy and early retirement schemes are part of our long-term financial planning and we have secured savings of more than £40 million over the past five years, recovering up-front costs within two years.“Employees generally receive less than 15 per cent of the cost listed in the accounts, which is required by law to provide a notional cost taking into account pension payments over their estimated remaining life expectancy.”A total of 3,707 workers left council jobs over the past two years with exit deals. They include former Lothian Buses pair Norman Strachan and Bill Devlin.The figures fell by 335 in 2017/18 to reach 1686.            The packages are largely made up of the cash which individuals receive through redundancy payments, as well lump sums paid in compensation and additional strain on the council’s pension scheme.The prospect of an English-style cap to end the six-figure payouts in Scotland’s public sector had been considered by the Scottish Government last year after newly devolved powers gave ministers control over severance deals. The situation south of the Border sees a cap of £95,000 on people leaving public sector bodies and applies to “all types of arrangements” including any pension top-up deals.A spokesman for local government body Cosla said councils had undergone “incredible transformational change”, which had meant the departure of many senior posts to streamline operations. He said: “We need to see beyond the headline figures, this is not like councils handing over sums of money for people to leave from a zero base.“The figures used clearly include staff leaving who have paid into a pension scheme throughout their working lives and who are entitled to such pension payments.“Two final things also worth pointing out – firstly, these payments are not set by the councils and secondly, this is actually about spending now to save in the longer term.”John O’Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, welcomed the decrease in the total amount paid out, but added: “The growing tendency to allow six-figure payouts is worrisome.“Across the public sector, there should be a cap on these ‘golden goodbyes’. The legislation for prohibiting exit payments above £95,000 is in place, but has not gone into force.“The sooner this limit is in place, the better. This kind of staggering excess should not be permissible in the public sector.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4778987.1533464526!/image/image.jpg","title":"independent scotland would need 20 years to remove trident ex snp adviser","story":"        An independent Scotland would be unable to remove Trident from Scottish waters for at least 20 years, a former defence adviser to the SNP has warned.                Instead of getting rid of the nuclear deterrent from the Clyde, an independent Scotland should explore leasing the Faslane facility to the UK government at around £1.1 billion per year.            The proposal has been made by Stuart Crawford in a paper which will be published this autumn looking at defence options in an independent Scotland post-Brexit.            Crawford argues that Trident would have to stay in the short to medium term because it would take two decades and £25 billion to build a facility comparable to Faslane south of the border.His proposal that Trident should stay until an alternative site can be built will be met with hostility from the SNP grassroots and leadership, which is passionately opposed to nuclear weapons.But Crawford, a defence commentator and former army officer, believes he is offering a pragmatic solution given the difficulties associated with getting rid \u2028of the deterrent, which supports around 7,000 military and civilian jobs in Scotland.Crawford believes that insisting on getting rid of nuclear weapons would pose a diplomatic problem for an independent Scotland in that the US would object.This, he believes, could see America block an independent Scotland’s accession to Nato.             Crawford’s paper will also outline the practical challenges of removing Trident from the Faslane/Coulport naval base on the Clyde and rehousing the weapons system south of the border. The most pressing would be replicating the bunkers specially designed for storing the nuclear warheads securely outside Scotland as well as the storage and jetty facilities for the submarines that carry them. Devonport, Falmouth, Port­land, Milford Haven and  Barrow-in-Furness have been suggested as possible replacements for Faslane. Crawford argues that all of them would require major work to be made suitable at a multi-billion pound cost. Crawford said: “The paper is going to say in essence that an independent Scotland cannot really sensibly insist on removal of the UK’s nuclear deterrent from its waters in the short to medium term.            “Therefore some pragmatic solution has to be adopted. The pragmatic solution is, in my opinion, to rent the Faslane nuclear facilities to the rest of the UK until such time as some other arrangement can be brought about.“If there is any chance of Scotland becoming an independent country in 2021, it would take the UK government at least 20 years to build the equivalent to the Faslane/Coulport facilities elsewhere in the UK. Then it would seem that some sort of leasing arrangement over 25 years or thereabouts would be sensible. “We reckon to build the new facility elsewhere in the UK, if a place can be found, it would probably cost somewhere in the region of £25 billion.“An educated estimate of what Scotland might be looking at to rent Faslane to the rest of the UK might be in the order of £1.1 billion per year.”Crawford acknowledged that his plan would not sit well with the SNP, but he argued that having Trident on Scottish soil would give the Scottish Government a strong hand in the negotiations to break up the UK.             “It is the most emotive defence-related issue in the whole independence debate. The difficult thing for the SNP leadership would be selling this to the foot soldiers. The broad base of the independence movement is very much grounded in the CND movement. I am completely sympathetic to that. “The SNP Government might look at this plan and say it doesn’t deliver our promise to remove Trident, but it would be the biggest bargaining chip that an independent Scotland could have.”Alex Salmond’s independence white paper prepared for the 2014 referendum aimed that Trident should be removed from Scotland within the first term of the Scottish Parliament immediately following independence. The blueprint said Scotland would become a non-nuclear Nato member, despite the organisation being a nuclear defence alliance. Under Salmond’s 2014 plans Faslane would be transformed into a conventional naval base and become joint headquarters of the Scottish defence forces. The white paper argued that removing the deterrent would prevent £100bn being “wasted” on maintaining a new nuclear weapons system.The prospect of a second Scottish independence referendum was put on the agenda by Nicola Sturgeon after the UK voted to leave the European Union. She has since “reset” her indyref2 plans, saying she would revisit the issue this autumn, assuming details of the UK’s Brexit deal are clearer by then.Earlier this year, the SNP published its Growth Commission, a document produced by the former SNP MSP and economist, Andrew Wilson, which acts as an independence blueprint. The Growth Commission said an independent Scotland’s defence budget would be 1.6 per cent of GDP, a saving on the UK’s plans for Scotland. But the document did not deal specifically with the Trident issue. The SNP’s opponents claimed Crawford’s model demonstrated that the SNP’s pledge to get rid of nuclear weapons lacked credibility.Douglas Ross, Scottish Conservative MP for Moray, said: “These comments add an element of realism to the SNP’s defence policy for an independent Scotland, something that has been sorely lacking for a long time. “However, the idea of the UK’s nuclear deterrent remaining on the Clyde for 20 years would not sit well with many rank and file nationalists.“It was never credible to think that Trident would just disappear from the Clyde following a Yes vote. There are thousands of Scottish jobs that depend on it. This is another example of policy and decision-making being driven by political dogma and the SNP’s obsession for separation at any cost.”An SNP spokeswoman said: “The SNP does not support Trident either as part of the UK or in an independent Scotland. We have continually opposed the renewal of Trident at the cost of conventional and cyber defences and continue to do so. In 2014 the Scottish Government set out a responsible approach to the removal of Trident from Scotland and in the event of independence securing the speediest and safest withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Scotland would be a priority for an SNP Scottish Government.” The Ministry of Defence declined to comment.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another.

They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky.

There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

I think if there’s any doubt in any competitor’s mind, that will show up a weakness.\n“So it’s important our guys feel confident and from the experience of Shetland inter-county matches before – of which me and [assistant manager] Robert [Geddes] have had a couple – we know that this team is capable of meeting the standard required to win.”\nHowever, Main is under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing his side.\nHe said: “Orkney at this moment in time in my mind are clear favourites [due to] their home record over the last year, albeit in a different format – the North Caledonian competition.\n“In addition, two years ago we went with great confidence and unfortunately came away with a defeat so we know they are extremely strong and difficult on their home park.”\n *Eighteen players will be travelling but only 16 can be selected for the match.\nMeanwhile, hopes are high that the Shetland women’s hockey team can improve on their recent record against Orkney.\nThis year’s game will see Orkney attempt to record a 14th straight victory.\nShetland’s last success came via a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in 2003, but joint coaches Derek and Brenda Leask believe the team is close to finally turning the corner.\nDerek Leask said: “The team is well prepared and have been focusing on strength and speed work with weekly Sunday morning training sessions at the Factory Gym at Whiteness.\n“Dhanni Moar and his coach Bryan Pearson, devised a 12-week training programme to have the lasses in peak condition. The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"town centre planter upturned by vandals ","story":"\nLiving Lerwick chairman Steve Mathieson said it had cost over £100 to replace the compost and flowers.\nThe planter is approximately a cubic metre and sits near Harry\u0026#8217s Department store.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001WH1307NCA.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

a great way to save money.\nA spokeswoman for Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council this week refuted the claims, saying: There have been no instances lately of bins not being collected other than due to local access issues and these are always followed up the next day.\u0026#160 \nStaff in the Waste team have flexible job roles and are employed where needed across cleansing, waste and recycling centres.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06.jpg","title":"65378  ","story":"    \nTHE Opening Ceremony for the Atlantic Challenge International Contest of Seamanship has taken place.\nEleven international teams are making Antrim their home for this week\u0027s event. \nTwo hundred young people from USA, Russia, Belgium, Great Britain,\u0026#160 Republic of Ireland,\u0026#160 France, Denmark, Canada and Northern Ireland will compete, live and learn together as part of the Atlantic Challenge. \nSpectators will have a great view from the Lough Shore of the 11 picturesque gigs as they race on Lough Neagh.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05.jpg","title":"65379  ","story":"    \nTHE 2018 MCE Insurance Ulster Grand Prix is less than a month away and anticipation is certainly building. \nFollowing a TT that saw Peter Hickman demolish the outright lap record to win a thrilling Senior TT finale ahead of Dean Harrison, the 7.4011 miles of Dundrod tarmac is the next meeting ground for these road-racing heavyweights. \nPeter, UGP Man of the Meeting in 2017 and now the world\u0027s fastest rider, secured podium finishes in four classes, three of which were as race winner.\nUlster Grand Prix Bike Week runs from August 5-11 and is gearing up to be the perfect climax to the international road-racing season.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a03.jpg","title":"65381  ","story":"    \nA SECTARIAN killer has appeared at Antrim Magistrate\u0027s Court charged with escaping lawful custody.\nStanding handcuffed in the dock, 32-year-old Christopher Kerr spoke only to confirm that he understood the four charges against him.\nIn addition to an offence of escaping lawful custody, Kerr is also accused of three drugs offences.\nThe alleged offences arose after he allegedly ran away from prison officers in Victoria Square shopping centre while out on day release.\nKerr, who is currently serving a life term for the shocking and horrifying sectarian attack which claimed the life of 15-year-old Catholic schoolboy Michael McIlveen, was arrested at Antrim Area Hospital the following day. \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a02f2.jpg","title":"65382  ","story":"    \nA CRUMLIN family has again been hit by tragedy after the sudden death of a teenager, just weeks after his father passed away.\nHenry Turley (14)\u0026#160 fell from a hotel balcony in the beach resort of Playa de Muro on Majorca in the early hours of last Wednesday (July 18).\nSpanish Civil Guard said his mother Claire was holding on to his hand and attempting to save him after he overbalanced on the second floor balcony before he fell at around midnight.\nHenry\u0027s death comes less than seven weeks after his father Stephen, who ran the Ten Storey tattoo parlour in Crumlin, was discovered dead at a friend\u0027s house.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06f-jpg.jpg","title":"65469  ","story":"    \nWITH last weekend\u0027s downpour bringing Antrim to a standstill, it was no surprise that rain also stopped played at Muckamore Cricket Club!\nAfter weeks of fine weather, normal service was finally resumed with one of the most dramatic downpours in living memory.\nMuckamore Firsts were taking on North Down at the time, but the players soon beat a hasty retreat to the clubhouse when the skies opened.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_894394.jpg--.jpg?1533024971000\n","title":"antrim rose roisin sets her sights on tralee","story":"  \nA PORTGLENONE woman is making her way to the dome as the Antrim Rose for the 59th Rose of Tralee Festival.\n  \nRoisin McCloskey came out triumphant at the heat held in the Le Mon Hotel in at the end of May.\n  \nIn competition with nine others she was announced as the Antrim Rose which there hasn\u0027t been since 2010.\n  \nSpeaking to the Ballymena , she said she is delighted to be going to Tralee and is looking forward to meeting all the other roses.\n  \nI am so excited about the experience.

John Kirkpatrick paid testament to William\u0027s character.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"65300  ","story":"                \nBALLYMONEY Foodbank has seen an almost 20% increase in usage since the introduction of Universal Credit in November 2017.\nThis is the disturbing news revealed by a Director of the local Foodbank after they recently compiled figures covering this past year. \nCo-Director of Ballymoney Foodbank Mr Peter Rawlins said: We looked at the number of vouchers dealt with, the number of people helped and the weight of food distributed in the six months leading up to November 2017 and in the five months after November 2017 (excluding December which is always a peak month for any foodbank) and we found there was an 18% increase in first five months of this year. \nMr Rawlins continued: This is a significant increase on the previous six months and on the corresponding months the previous year. Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Loughbrickland Branch looks forward to proudly representing Loughbrickland area at the event.”\n\nAs local champions of Remembrance, the Loughbrickland Branch of The Royal British Legion is looking to work in partnership with their community to bring their unique Remembrance message to the Menin Gate, on their wreath, where it will be displayed in a wreath installation for viewing by the general public until the end of August. Two schools Scarva Primary and Bronte Primary have written messages that will be attached to the wreath\n\nThe parade will start at midday and we encourage the public to make the trip across to Ypres for the August 8 and fill the Market Square to watch the parade, One Hundred Days ceremony and then enjoy an afternoon of musical entertainment including The Central Band of the Royal British Legion.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIf you want to find out more about GP90 or your local Royal British Legion branch, then visit www. britishlegion.org.uk/branches/loughbrickland or contact Loughbrickland.Secretary@rblmunity\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8529070.1533295653!/image/image.jpg","title":"remains of joint was found in the driver s seat of vehicle","story":"\nWhen police noticed the smell of cannabis coming from a car they found the remains of a joint in the driver\u0026#8217s seat, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nJustin Henderson McGowan, whose address was given as Clare Road, Tandragee, admitted unlawful possession of cannabis and herbal cannabis on May 13 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe court heard that at 8.45pm a police mobile patrol in Meadow Lane, Portadown, noticed a strong smell of cannabis coming from the defendant’s vehicle.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe remains of a joint were found on the driver’s seat and he accepted he had a grinder with a small amount of cannabis in it.

Through their images the artists strive to provide a shared unique view of our ever changing world. The connections to be found in the paintings have their origins in the subsequent years of collaboration and friendship and in the mutual understanding of contemporary art which has been formed.\n\nOn opening night a painting by Tommy was presented by the collective to the permanent collection of the Gallery. It is hoped this will provide a lasting reminder of the event and be enjoyed by visitors for many years to come. It adds to an already impressive body of Tommy’s work held in significant international collections. \n\nTommy was quick to thank all those involved, in particular curator Marijana Ramov and organiser Jasna Barisic. The whole celebration was planned with an eye to detail and on opening night the gallery was absolutely stunning. Music by Croatian duo Lucija Grabovac and Tony Vlasic provided a melodic soundtrack and complimented the occasion perfectly.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTommy believes that exhibiting internationally and presenting our artistic culture is important and it is a challenge which he relishes. We are all becoming more connected, something which we can all enjoy. Croatia is fast becoming a popular holiday destination, something which he finds completely unsurprising. Dalmatia is an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nHe considers the combination of clear blue seas, historic villages and natural cuisine a compelling mix. It is a region which he enjoys and which he hopes to visit again.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"kerri ann in limbo as she faces long wait","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA YOUNG\n Newtownabbey woman who suffers from suspected multiple sclerosis (MS) has said that “nothing in her future is certain” as she faces a possible two-year wait for treatment.\n\n24-year-old Kerri Ann Flanagan had suffered from bouts of paralysis and pain for around five years before optic neurosis claimed the sight in one of her eyes in April.\n\nAfter years of misdiagnosis, Kerri Ann was eventually referred to a neurologist and an MRI scan showed a number of symptoms linked to MS.\n\nThe MRI uncovered 10 lesions on Kerri Ann’s brain and instances of demyelination – where the cover on the nerve cells on the brain is worn away, leaving them exposed to further damage.\n\nDespite the severity of her condition, Kerri Ann could be faced with a two-year wait for treatment, and she said she’s  “absolutely terrified”.\n\n“That worry and that fear has caused me so much extra stress and anxiety,” she said. \n\n“The waiting lists are adding pressure to people who are already dealing with so much. I just feel like nothing in my future is certain any more. I had so many ideas of things I wanted to do, I was planning on getting married to my fiancé, and now I just feel like my life is on hold. I’ve been suffering from the symptoms for about five years. It has gotten worse in the last two years, especially with the pain.\n\n“When I went to A\u0026#038E with the paralysis they told me it was a migraine and sent me home.\n\n“It was awful because I knew that it wasn’t the case – I knew there was more to it. You know your own body. It was really frustrating and I felt that because of my age I was constantly being dismissed. \n\n“They were saying things like ‘Somebody your age wouldn’t have’ whatever, but there are plenty of young people who suffer from things like MS. It’s really important that they start to realise that. It was frustrating to be treated that way.”\n\nAs well as suffering some of the most debilitating symptoms linked to MS, Kerri Ann told how her condition impacts on her mental health.\n\n“It’s hard,” she said. \n\n“Since I took really ill in May and lost my sight it’s gone really downhill from there. So many symptoms keep flaring up. There are days I can’t get out of bed. It’s very unpredictable. I don’t even want to leave the house because things can change so fast. I could be fine one minute then in and hour I could lost the ability the to walk, I could fall, or my speech could be slurred. It makes me very self-conscious as well. I have had people ask if I’m drunk or on something else. I shouldn’t be embarrassed, but it’s so difficult to explain. It has just made my life so hard. My mental health has suffered terribly, not just because of the MS, but because of the pressure of the wait on an appointment. There are lots of people with different health problems, serious health problems that are in a similar situation. It’s not acceptable.”\n\nKerri Ann’s mum, Kim Flanagan, said that underfunding of the NHS was exacerbating her daughter’s condition. \n\n“In 2016 there was an MS specialist in the Royal [Victoria Hospital] who has come out on a number of occasions and said that his patients were waiting 16 months to be seen, that it was unacceptable and that it was endangering they’re health,” she said. \n\n“He said that it was down to cuts in budget. Kerri Ann will wait 12 months to see a neurologist, and then it could be a further six months or more for and MS clinic. That’s almost two years before you get a treatment plan. She has been paralysed in both legs and one arm. She has had trouble swallowing, chewing and talking, feeling like she’s on a boat or that she’s drunk. They are all symptoms of MS. She ticks so many of the boxes. We’re talking one to two years by the time a treatment plan is in place, during which time that demyelination in the brain will continue to wear away at the covers on her nerve cells – it’s more irreparable damage. Why can’t the government get back together and do something? Northern Ireland has one of the highest rates of MS in the UK, especially amongst women, and the Assembly aren’t even sitting. They are failing the people. We don’t want this publicity, but it has to be done.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Belfast Trust said: “The patient is waiting for an urgent appointment at the MS Clinic where there is currently a five month waiting time. She will see a Consultant Neurologist specialising in Multiple Sclerosis at this clinic. The patient will not have to wait 12 months to see a Neurologist before that appointment.” \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"photographer thomas is the pride of belfast media group","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nAN intimate\n retrospective of photographs chronicling 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement is set to come under the spotlight at St Mary’s University College as part of Féile an Phobail’s 30th celebrations.\nDuring his 20-plus years as a photo journalist with the North Belfast News, Thomas McMullan has captured seminal photographs depicting the darkest days of the conflict, the “early mornings and even longer days of the peace process talks” and “the lighter moments during that period”.\nHaving always had an interest in “striking images” Thomas explained how it wasn’t until his early 20s that he picked up a camera hoping to “make a living out of it”.\n“I first started off with a wee magazine in Ardoyne called Horizon, it was a community magazine and it was there that I decided I want to make a career out of taking photographs. I really loved it and I would’ve tried to take photos out of anything newsworthy,” he said.\nThomas spoke of how he approached Andersonstown News founder Basil McLaughlin and Belfast Media Group managing director Máirtín Ó Muilleoir at their West Belfast offices, who after going through his portfolio “gave me a start and that was 20 years ago.”\n“At the North Belfast News we were capturing the moment of the peace process, it was a very fraught, fragile time,” he said.\n“We were talking to prominent republicans, loyalists, peacemakers at that time. I wanted the photos to reflect on why we were going through a peace process, why we were going through a struggle for peace.”\nThomas spoke of how trying to condense 20 years worth of work down to “15, 20 photo’s” was a tough ask. “It was extremely hard to whittle down the photos, you have to be critical of your own work but I got there,” he laughed.\nThe multiple recipient of NI Provincial Press Photographer of the Year says it will be a fantastic opportunity to see his work up alongside his fellow artists when the St Mary’s Visual Arts exhibition goes live on Thursday evening.\n“This is a piece of history for me coinciding with 30 years of Féile. I’m really looking forward to seeing all the other work. I was always a member of the Christian Brother’s camera club on the Antrim Road and owe them a lot.\n“I hope those who are coming will appreciate the work.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36707179.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/012-_Read-Only_%202.jpg","title":"revealed gcse league table for northern ireland 2018 where did your","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Grammar schools dominated the top of the league tables for GCSE results achieved in 2017, taking the top 54 places.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Budgets for every Northern Ireland school 2018-19\n\n\n\n\nThe Belfast \u0027s league tables include data on every secondary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe top non-grammar school at GCSE in 2016/17 was St Patrick\u0027s High School, Keady (91.3%), followed by St Colm\u0027s High School in Draperstown (87.7%), and St Patrick\u0027s College, Maghera (85.9%) - just ahead of the top performing controlled non-grammar, Castlederg High School (83.3%).Overall across Northern Ireland in 2016/17, some 70.3% of year 12 pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (or equivalent) including English and maths.\n\nThis was up 2.4 percentage points from 2015/16.\n\nPeter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar, described its joint topping of the latest league tables as a surprise 85th birthday present for the Co Down school.\n\n\"I am delighted with the phenomenal achievement of our Assumption girls at both GCSE level and A2 level,\" he said.\n\n\"The girls and the staff of Assumption have worked so hard and fully deserve this public recognition of our academic success.\n\n\"However, it is the school\u0027s \u0027Fully Alive\u0027 ethos which underpins every aspect of why Assumption Grammar is such a unique educational establishment and has been since we were first established by the Missionary Sisters of the Assumption 85 years ago this year.\n\n\"This is a surprise birthday present which will bring a smile to all our Assumption girls, past and present.\"\n\nDown High principal Maud Perry said the school was very proud of its results and she paid tribute to the hard work of pupils.\n\n\"We celebrate the many talents and achievements of all our pupils at Down High and we\u0027re very proud of the 100% pass rate at GCSE in both mathematics and English,\" she said.\n\n\"Our motto \u0027nothing is achieved without effort\u0027 reflects our belief that there is no limit to what can be accomplished through hard work.\n\n\"This hard work of staff and pupils, alongside the support of our parents, produced these fantastic results in the 2017 summer exam season.\"\n\nToday\u0027s tables also represent a triumph for south Belfast grammar school Wellington College, which scored 94.7%, significantly above the Northern Ireland average, as it works to be removed from formal intervention.\n\nPrincipal David Castles said: \"We are very proud of the excellent GCSE outcomes our students have attained. This significant improvement is part of our drive at Wellington College to raise standards, engage students and build pathways to success.\n\n\"Excellence in exams is a result of students, staff and parents working together, and these GCSE results give a great foundation for success at A-level and beyond.\"\n\nHow we did sums for the latest league tables\n\nThe Belfast  is the only source of comprehensive league tables showing the results of every post-primary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe obtained the data from the Department of Education for A-level and GCSE examinations sat in the 2016/17 academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read league tables, ordered from top to bottom. In the GCSE league tables, the Belfast  has used the percentage of pupils in the final year of a level 3 course who achieved five or more GCSEs - including English and Maths -between an A* to C grade in each school as the standard measure.\n\nThe Department of Education does not produce A-level or GCSE league tables and said it does not endorse them.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed transfer test grade intake for northern ireland schools","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In the 2016/17 academic year 11,570 applications were made for the 8,743 available places at our 63 selective grammars.\n\n\n\n\nNI Transfer Tests: 2017 Grammar Schools’ intake and grade information\n\n\nThis is out of a total of 21,763 pupils who obtained Year 8 places at Northern Ireland\u0027s 199 post-primary schools in September 2017.\n\nToday the Belfast  can reveal what grades or scores it took to get into each of our selective grammars last year.\n\nThis exclusive data was obtained over several months by sending Freedom of Information Act requests to each of the selective grammars.\n\nCurrently there are no official figures provided by the Department of Education, because both the Post Primary Transfer Consortium\u0027s GL assessment and the Association of Quality Education\u0027s (AQE) Common Entrance Assessment are unofficial tests.\n\nOur data for tests sat in the 2016/17 academic year reveal:\n\n\nFive schools which use the AQE system did not accept a score below 100 in September 2017.\n\nFive schools which use the GL system did not accept a grade below an A in September 2017.\n\n30 schools accepted AQE scores, while 26 accepted GL scores, and seven took either.\n\nLagan College, which is partially selective, was the most popular first choice by far, with 456 applications for 200 places.\n\nFriends School Lisburn was one of the toughest schools to get into last September - the lowest score it accepted was 106 (AQE).\n\nThree of the 63 selective grammar schools were not oversubscribed.\n\nThe AQE and GL tests received a total number of 14,491 entries in the 2016/17 academic year - 7,725 sat the AQEs and 6,766 sat the GL tests. An unknown number of pupils sat both tests.\n\nThere are 199 post-primary schools in Northern Ireland, of which 63 are grammars that use academic selection for all or some of their Year 8 intake.\n\n\nLeaders in the AQE and GL organisations told the Belfast  that their entry rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade following the abolition of the old Department of Education-administered 11-plus by former Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in 2008.\n\nAQE chief executive Stephen Connolly said the number of entrants to the test is continuing to rise, with 8,169 pupils registered for the 2017 AQE tests, a rise of almost 6% on 2016 (7,725).\n\nMr Connolly said he can only speculate on the increase, but said he believed it may partly follow a decision by former Education Minister Peter Weir to allow primary schools to prepare pupils to sit transfer tests. That reversed a ruling by his predecessor John O\u0027Dowd, which saw schools receive warning letters from the department over preparing pupils for tests within school hours.\n\n\"That reflects a number of things, that is the steadily increasing primary school age population, also a backwash from the former minister taking the shackles off primary schools and allowing them to openly prepare pupils for transfer tests, and also word of mouth from parent to parent,\" he said. There was also an increase in the number of pupils who sat the PPTC\u0027s GL test, from 6,766 in the 2016/17 academic year to 7,150 in 2017/18.\n\nCarol McCann from the PPTC said parents remained very supportive of the tests.\n\n\"More than 30 schools use the GL test and it is used by a variety of types of school, including grammar and bilateral,\" she said.\n\n\"A number of PPTC schools also register pupils for the AQE test. Regarding the increase in the number of pupils sitting the test in 2017 for entry to post-primary in 2018, it is most likely as a result of a rising primary school population in a number of areas.\n\n\"It is very evident that the transfer test continues to be supported by parents in Northern Ireland who believe in educational choice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks between the two transfer test providers to create a single system of assessment remain \"ongoing and positive\".\n\nThe AQE and PPTC aim to have a common test in place by November 2019. Mr Connolly said that talks are continuing but the end goal is very complex, and they want to ensure any new single system is robust, will have the confidence of parents, and is of an international standard.\n\n\"The two negotiating teams made a very good decision at the outset to keep it confidential to not raise expectation or increase pressures and making sure the goodwill between us in this difficult process is maintained,\" he said. \"Trying to put together a single system is very difficult.\n\n\"I think it is very important that both groups think it is a matter of principle there should be one system.\n\n\"That principle has been agreed, but getting there is tricky simply because of the complexity of the two systems. People need to have confidence in schools, but also in the testing system.\n\n\"It needs to be reliable, robust and meet international standards. It isn\u0027t just a race to cobble together any old compromise, we are engaging in careful negotiation.\" Results for both tests are due to be released to pupils this Saturday.\n\nHow the figures are compiled\n\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) legislation we asked the grammar schools in Northern Ireland which use academic selection to determine their Year 8 intake to provide the breakdown of the AQE/GL grades/scores achieved by the pupils they admitted in September 2017.\n\nThe data gives schools’ name, location, the highest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted and the lowest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted.\n\nOther information included is the number of first preference choices it received and total applications (which includes first, second, third choices etc).\n\nSeveral schools have provided bands for the lowest and highest scores they accepted, as this is the method they used to select pupils. Some schools accept both AQE and GL scores.\n\nNot all schools use academic selection to determine their entire intake. Wallace High School in Lisburn admits around 90% of its Year 8 intake on test results Campbell College in Belfast admits 70%, while Lagan College in Belfast and Slemish College in Ballymena select 35% of their pupils using test scores. Some other schools also use additional criteria to separate students with the same score vying for the final places. Two voluntary grammar schools, Loreto College in Coleraine and St Patrick’s Grammar in Armagh, no longer use academic selection.\n\nTotal pupil figures do not tally for a number of reasons, which can include pupils with a statement of special educational needs not being included in enrolment figures, and some pupils being accepted through special circumstances or on appeal.\n\nIn some schools pupils were admitted without using academic selection and some schools were undersubscribed.\n\nWhen comparing schools, the size should be taken into account. For example Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor has an annual Year 8 intake of 157 pupils. Its principal Mr W E Thompson pointed out that the 157th pupil they accepted in September 2017 scored 85 in the AQE test, but in the North Down area there are smaller selective grammars which accepted only 100 pupils.\n\nHe has asked us to point out that the 100th pupil Glenlola accepted scored 98 in the AQE tests.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37183561.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/pe_00505565.jpg","title":"alex kane only a fool would dismiss the idea that british government wont spring another surprise","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Irrespective of how strong an argument or position, maybe it is always wrong to assume that circumstances cannot or will not change. My view remains that the Union will survive. But it will not survive because Robinson, Sammy Wilson and I say so.\n\nIt will only survive if unionism, collectively and individually, makes a strong case, sells the message, expands the support base and prepares for all eventualities. That is all Robinson is saying.\n\nWhen I suggested in an article a couple of weeks before the 2017 Assembly election that there was a possibility - albeit a slim one - unionists could lose their overall majority, a leading DUP MLA told me, \"Don\u0027t be silly, Alex, that\u0027s not going to happen. \n\n\"Why would you even write something like that?\"\n\nWell, they lost that majority. Unionists don\u0027t have a majority of either Council or Assembly seats across Belfast (24/60 BCC and 6/20 NIA). The overall vote for candidates who declared themselves as pro-Union/unionist at the last few elections has hovered uncomfortably close to or slightly lower than the 50% barrier.\n\nWhile recent opinion polls haven\u0027t given a consistent trend on support for Irish unity, they do suggest that what happens regarding the final Brexit deal could have a significant impact on two or three key demographics.\n\nGiven that sort of background, it would be a very sanguine or very stupid unionist who would argue that unionists shouldn\u0027t give serious consideration to a number of possibilities. The primary one, as Robinson says, is that a border poll is possible, particularly under a Labour government. It is the Secretary of State who makes the call - not unionists, not the DUP, not even Sammy Wilson. I would prefer that the leaders of unionism had given some thought to the possibility and made some sort of preparation for the campaign rather, than as Robinson says, burying their heads in the sand until \"only the soles of their feet are visible above the surface\".\n\nRobinson, Wilson and the rest of us from that generation will remember the body blow dealt to unionism by the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985. They will remember the despair. They will remember how close we came to a tipping point. They will remember that something dismissed as an impossibility by the leadership of unionism at the time happened: happened over their heads and without any consultation.\n\nOnly a fool, a blinkered, irresponsible, thoroughly delusional fool would believe that a British government would not, again, spring another monumental shock upon unionism. And only a unionist of monumental stupidity would refuse to discuss, let alone prepare for that eventuality. \"Contingency planning is a judicious safety-net. Better by far to plan for adverse possibilities, no matter how remote, than be left clueless and unprepared if our hopes and evaluations are wrong\". Robinson is right. He wrote something similar in the joint UUP/DUP response to the Anglo-Irish Agreement published in June 1987 (The Task Force Report: An End To Drift):\n\n\"The temptation in such circumstances might be to do nothing. However we would consider this the ultimate abdication of responsibility.\"\n\nTo be honest, not much was done. Unionism paid the price of that ongoing abdication of responsibility by the leadership of both parties. Robinson, perhaps mindful of how the report he co-authored was never given the consideration it deserved, is right to remind unionists, all of us, of the continuing perils of not being prepared.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast pride parade 2018 thousands take to streets to celebrate","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, no meeting is scheduled before Saturday\u0027s parade. Calls have now been made for a special meeting of the council on Friday. If that does not happen, then the flags will not fly.\n\nThe \u0027call-in\u0027 move comes after a notice of motion brought by Sinn Fein on flying the flags narrowly passed 12-11 at a full council meeting last Monday evening. DUP councillors voted against the motion while the Ulster Unionists abstained after their amendment recommending that council buildings be lit in the pride colours instead was rejected.\n\nA council spokesperson confirmed the \u0027call in\u0027 had been received.\n\nSinn Fein group leader on the council Darren McNally slammed the DUP for trying to prevent the flying of the Rainbow flag.\n\n\"The move by the DUP to call-in Sinn Fein\u0027s motion to fly the rainbow flag at civic buildings across the area is disgraceful and disrespectful to our LGBTQ+ community,\" he said. \"This call-in came in the final hour - and is an effort to run down the clock on gaining legal advice and securing a special meeting of the council before Saturday.\"\n\nMayor of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Julie Flaherty confirmed: \"The call-in was received on Tuesday morning and it\u0027s now in the hands of the Chief Executive.

Sinn Fein of course have led the charge, proudly proclaiming in the Irish News: \u0027Sinn Fein Vows to unseat Paisley\u0027.\n\n\"Many see this as their opportunity to oust Northern Ireland\u0027s most gifted voice in Parliament on Brexit. They also see it as an opportunity to rid themselves finally of Paisley\u0027s voice in defence of the union and on the Biblical moral issues such as same sex marriage and abortion.\"\n\nCllr Finlay said that this is why a few of Mr Paisley\u0027s friends had decided to call a meeting with him \"to show our support and hear from him first-hand how we tackle the future.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let us show the world that the friends of Ian Paisley still stand behind the man they believe in, good times and bad.\"\n\nMr Paisley could face a by-election if he is recalled under the terms of the Petition of Recall Act 2015. \n\nThe law gives constituents the power to recall their MPs, with an election triggered by at least 10% of the electorate in the constituency signing a petition.\n\nWith 75,478 constituents in Mr Paisley\u0027s North Antrim constituency, 7,547 signatures would be required to trigger a by-election.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"man found on side of road with significant head injury in co armagh","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37186170.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Mary_Lou_McDonald_Castlewellan.jpg","title":"the time for irish unity referendum is near sinn feins mcdonald","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

and Dorset coast, such as Gosport, are most likely to feel the heat on Saturday, while the hottest areas on Sunday are expected to be around London stretching north to the Midlands.\n\n\nPlenty of sunshine means that \n#UV\n levels will be high across the bulk of England and Wales, and moderate for Scotland and Northern Ireland \npic.twitter/3yO3k7weM1\n\n— Met Office (@metoffice) \nAugust 4, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTemperatures could soar even higher early next week, with highs of 32C (89.6F) possible around London on Monday and Tuesday. \n\nBritons making the most of the balmy weekend were urged to stay “sun sensible” amid the high UV levels. \n\nHowever, not all of the UK will be gazing into clear blue skies – in Scotland and Northern Ireland clouds are likely with some thick enough to bring patchy rain to the north and west of Scotland. \n\nThe north-west, south-east split will continue early next week, with further showers expected across Scotland and Northern Ireland, while England and Wales stay generally dry and warmer. \n\n\nWe don’t know if you’ve heard… but it’s VERY… VERY hot!\n\nBe sun sensible this summer\n\n🌞🌞🌞 🌶️🌶️ 🌶️🌶️🌶️\n— EEAST Ambulance (@EastEnglandAmb) \nAugust 4, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTemperatures will need to climb significantly if they are to come close to England’s current August record – 38.5C (101.3F) reached in Faversham, Kent, in 2003.\n\nHowever, the intense heat is likely to lessen come Wednesday, as conditions turn “fresher and more changeable”, the Met Office said. \n\nIt comes amid an intense European heatwave, with holidaymakers in Portugal and Spain feeling the sun most intensely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\n\n\nThe mercury is being driven higher by a hot air mass moving north from Africa, bringing dust from the Sahara Desert.\n\nEarlier this week local records were smashed in eight areas of Portugal, with temperatures peaking at 45.2C (113.4F) near Abrantes, a town in the centre of the country.\n\nEmergency services have issued a red alert until Sunday, with medical staff and firefighters on standby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA boy jumps from a platform over the water at La Concha beach in northern Spain (Alvaro Barrientos/AP)\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, 400 firefighters and five water-dropping aircraft are battling a wildfire in southern Portugal’s Algarve region.\n\nIn Spain, heat warnings have been issued for 41 of the country’s 50 provinces as temperatures are expected to reach up to 44C (111.2F).\n\nIn northern Europe, Sweden is still under threat from wildfires, which in recent weeks have extended into the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe Met Office said it was unlikely that the overall European highest temperature recorded – 48C (118.4F) in Athens, Greece in 1977 – would be beaten.\n\nBritish holiday-makers abroad are being warned to avoid spending time in the sun during the hottest part of the day and to keep hydrated. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures beaches and lakes busy as britain basks in

However paint provides much more colour possibilities.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Brant Georgia/PA)\n\n\n\n\nBrant also began taking lessons with a local artist to hone their skills and used Bob Ross as inspiration.\n\n“Often people are afraid of taking lessons because they think that they aren’t skilled or talented enough to even be taught,” they said.\n\n“I felt this way when I started painting as well. I often referred to a quote by the landscape painter, Bob Ross: ‘talent is a pursued interest.’ Bob believed that anyone could learn to paint, it was just a matter of picking up the brush for the first time.”\n\nBrant has a lesson for anyone interested in a creative pursuit.\n\n“Just start making art.\n\n“It doesn’t matter whether you’re good or bad at the beginning, you will always be improving over time if you are determined and keep painting or practising your craft.\n\n“Whether or not someone is talented or not does not mean that not everyone can create something. I believe that everyone has the need to be creative in some way and they have the ability to create something.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch a helicopter emerges out of the mist on lake district road","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Strabane District Council and City of Derry Spartans have announced this week that the race will act as a qualifier for the NI squad for the inaugural Commonwealth Half Marathon Championships on Sunday October 7\nth\n in Cardiff.\n\nThe race has already been confirmed as the host event for the NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships which has swelled demand for places as Race Director Gerry Lynch explained:\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])

entries to date as well as 40 plus relay teams of three which is a big increase on last year and indicates that the individual limit will be reached soon,” he revealed.\n\n“The NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships and qualification for the Commonwealth Championships is a big carrot for the top male and female entrants to aim for and this should add to the quality of the field and the up front competition on the day.\n\n“The event sells out every year and with the continued growth of athletics and running clubs locally our advice to anyone intending to take part is to register online now to avoid disappointment when entries close on August 13\nth\n.”\nThe Waterside Half Marathon is one of the longest running athletics events in Ireland with a scenic route that takes in both sides of the River Foyle, passing many of the city’s historic landmarks including its famous walls and the Guildhall.\nThe 13.1 mile course has runner, wheelchair and three person relay categories, the event is open to athletes of all levels and abilities and all entrants to the main race must be aged 17 or over on race day.\nA number of groups have already registered for the event to raise funds for their chosen charities including a group of over 20 runners from Firstsource Solutions in Derry who are taking part in aid of Foyle Search and Rescue.\nThe event includes a team of 12 pacers who will be identifiable at the race start by helium balloons displaying their times.\nPacer times start at 1 hour and 30 minutes and rise in increments of 15 minutes up to 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n“The pacers are all experienced runners who have studied the terrain of the course beforehand and they have always been spot on with their timings,” Gerry explained.\n“The beauty of having different pacers is that if peoples’ goals change during the race they have the option to slow down or speed up to join the pacers behind or in front.\n“Pacers will be walking around the start line for half an hour before the race and will be identifiable by helium balloons and t shirts showing their time so runners can file in behind them at the race start.”\n“It’s a spectator friendly route with the start and finish at St Columb’s Park and people can stand anywhere along the river bank on the west bank and enjoy the action.\n“Between the Peace Bridge and Coshowen runners will be running in both directions so that is a particularly good place to enjoy the action.”\nAll participants will receive a specially commissioned Waterside Half Marathon medal and race t shirt.\nEntries to the race close at midnight on Monday 13\nth\n August 2018 and you can register online now
