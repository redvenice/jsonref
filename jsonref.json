Pictured: The Lewis home But giving evidence, Mrs Fenton steadfastly denied doctoring the plan to her Grade-II listed home and said, as far as she is concerned, the wall is all hers.\u0027Of course it\u0027s my wall, it\u0027s always been my wall,\u0027 she told Central London County Court.\u0027I was transferred a house with four walls. No one since 1969 has ever suggested to me that I have a house with a party wall.\u0027I didn\u0027t do it. I\u0027m absolutely sure that I have never made alterations to anything. To be accused of altering documents, I\u0027m astounded.\u0027I am being castigated here. I have been harassed by this man (Mr Lewis) for years.\u0027The neighbours have been at loggerheads since the late 1990s when the Lewises moved into the street, which is close to Abbey Road studios.Both neighbours were friendly with McCartney, with a judge in an earlier hearing describing Mrs Fenton\u0027s relationship with the Beatle as \u0027excellent\u0027.However, the relationship between the Lewises and Mrs Fenton has been less cordial, with arguments dating back to their first years living next door.          They are neighbours with Paul McCartney and are friendly with him, with a judge in an earlier hearing describing Mrs Fenton\u0027s relationship with the Beatle as \u0027excellent\u0027. Pictured: McCartney\u0027s home Mrs Fenton lost a case brought against her by her neighbours in 2005 over her installation of fence panels on the shared garden wall.She won the next battle in 2015 when a judge ordered the Lewises to remove a roof from which water had flowed from their extension onto Mrs Fenton\u0027s property.They have since taken down the roof, but now plan to build an enlarged structure, which they say would finally solve the rainwater problem.Last year, an independent surveyor issued a Party Wall Award, which authorises them to raise the boundary wall to build their extension.But that only led the neighbours back to court, as Mrs Fenton launched her challenge to the surveyor\u0027s decision.  Sir Paul\u0027s home is separated from the two homes and is not involved Her barrister, Stuart Frame, claims that the Party Wall Award should be overturned as the wall in question is not actually shared.\u0027It is Mrs Fenton\u0027s case that the works authorised by the award cannot be executed due to the fact that the configuration of the walls in the immediate vicinity of the proposed works are not as assumed by the surveyor making the award,\u0027 he said.Mr and Mrs Lewis say their neighbour should not be allowed to argue that the wall is hers alone, claiming she agreed informally through solicitors 21 years ago that the boundary runs down the middle of the wall.She then stood by \u0027in silence\u0027 while the original extension was built off the wall, Mr Rainey told Judge Nicholas Parfitt.Much of her case also referred to the plan which contains the allegedly fraudulent annotations, indicating that Mrs Fenton owns the whole wall.\u0027The current proposed extension is by way of compliance with the order in 2015, requiring Mr and Mrs Lewis to replace the roof of their extension,\u0027 said Mr Rainey.\u0027The judge was told that if the roof had to come off, the opportunity would be taken to build the additional storey.\u0027Mrs Fenton has done everything in her power, including issuing these proceedings, to interfere with Mr and Mrs Lewis\u0027 attempts to comply with that order.\u0027The judge reserved his decision on the case until a later date."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/17/0492F49F000007D0-0-image-m-6_1529425002669.jpg","title":"Disney ups Twenty First Century Fox 70 3B","story":" Disney has made a $70.3 billion counterbid for 21st Century Fox following Comcast\u0027s $65 billion offer for the company.

Ms Ardern is set to make history as the first New Zealand Prime Minister to give birth while in the top seat          Following the birth, the government will be led by Winston Peters, 73, for six weeks. Ms Ardern (pictured at Polyfest in March) assured she would still be on call, and it would be business as usualDuring Ms Ardern\u0027s maternity leave, Mr Peters - the leader of the minority NZ First Party which forms part of New Zealand\u0027s coalition government - will have powers similar to those he would have if the prime minister was overseas.He will run the day-to-day operations in Wellington and will consult with Ms Ardern on \u0027significant political, strategic or public interest, or national security\u0027 matters.But he\u0027ll still be limited by the decisions of the Labour Party-dominated cabinet. Recent Newshub-Reid research polling found 39 per cent think Mr Peters will do a good job, the rest were either unsure or pessimistic.Often described as a populist, Mr Peters is the most experienced hand and one of the most iconic figures in the country\u0027s political landscape - but he is also polarising and has an often combative relationship with the media.He\u0027s formed coalition governments with both the centre-left and centre-right (playing the role of \u0027kingmaker\u0027 to leverage concessions out of the major parties), and since entering parliament in 1979 has held numerous senior cabinet posts, including deputy PM in the 1990s .          New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern (C) is the first PM to walk in the Pride Parade on February 17, 2018 in AucklandBut while he and Ms Ardern\u0027s Labour Party may not have seen eye-to-eye on some issues recently, they\u0027ve been talking up the trust between them.\u0027I\u0027ve almost found it surprising people have questioned that it will be anything other than business as usual for us,\u0027 Ms Ardern said.She became a mother just months after she took the country\u0027s top job in October.Ms Ardern announced she was pregnant in a Facebook post in January this year.          \u0027I\u0027ll be Prime Minister AND a mum, and Clarke will be \u0027first man of fishing\u0027 and stay-at-home dad,\u0027 she wrote on Facebook \u0027I\u0027ll be Prime Minister AND a mum, and Clarke will be \u0027first man of fishing\u0027 and stay-at-home dad,\u0027 she said at the time.\u0027I think it\u0027s fair to say that this will be a wee one that a village will raise but we couldn\u0027t be more excited.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/21/08/4D790E1D00000578-0-image-a-5_1529564584362.jpg","title":"Newcastle Utd footballer Ciaran Clark knocked unconscious Magaluf bar","story":"Newcastle United star Ciaran Clark (pictured) was attacked in a Magaluf nightclub after his friend was involved in a brawl sparked by men flirting with their girlfriends, it has emerged           The defender is said to have been injured after stepping in to help his friend who had allegedly been hit over the head with a bottle at Crystal\u0027s Bar (pictured) on the Spanish holiday island of MajorcaPolice confirmed he had suffered a lip injury, but said they could not confirm he had been knocked out and revealed he had gone to hospital himself in a taxi while his friend was taken away by ambulance.Hospital sources confirmed Clark had been treated in A\u0026ampE at Son Espases Hospital in the Majorcan capital Palma, but had not been admitted to hospital.He is thought to have had stitches to a lip wound, although there was no immediate confirmation today.Millionaire heiress of property empire, 25, is brutally...\u0027Racist\u0027 Welsh yobs tear down St George\u0027s flag from English...Share this articleThe whereabouts of his friend, thought to be 31 and named locally only by his first name and initials Adam J.S, is not known.Police sources said he was stopped after being spotted running along Magaluf\u0027s notorious party strip Punta Ballena with his shirt off and blood coming from a head wound, around 2am on Sunday morning.A bouncer at Crystal\u0027s, the bar where the incident took place, told them he had kicked all the men involved in the altercation out of the nightspot.The source said a woman who identified herself as Mr Clark\u0027s girlfriend told them the violence flared after a man among another group of holidaymakers the alleged aggressor was with started bothering them on the dance floor.\u0027She said the footballer\u0027s friend got upset because one of the men was trying to flirt with them and punched him and one of the men\u0027s pals reacted by hitting him over the head with a bottle,\u0027 the source revealed.  The Republic of Ireland defender - who played for England up to U20 level - is said to have been taken to Son Espases Hospital in the Majorcan capital Palma\u0027She said Ciaran was hurt as he tried to protect his friend.\u0027The men the alleged attacker was with had been tracked down by this time to a street nearby where they were outside a disco and the arrest was made once the woman identified as Ciaran\u0027s girlfriend gave them a description of his attacker.\u0027A spokesman for Calvia Town Hall, which covers the Magaluf area, confirmed: \u0027Local police arrested a 32-year-old British man on suspicion of two assaults.\u0027He was handed over to the Civil Guard the same night so he could be taken to court.\u0027Both men who were hurt were attended by medical staff. They were both British.\u0027One was taken to hospital by ambulance and the other said he didn\u0027t require an ambulance transfer to hospital and made his own way to Son Espases Hospital in a taxi.\u0027It will be up to the local courts now to determine the possible criminal responsibility of those involved in this incident but only one man has been arrested and is currently being investigated as a suspect.\u0027The footballers and their partners are understood to have been staying at Pure Salt Port Adriano, a luxury hotel on the road to the resort of Santa Ponsa.          Hospital sources confirmed Clark had been treated in A\u0026ampE at Son Espases Hospital in the Majorcan capital Palma, but had not been admitted to hospital. He is thought to have had stitches to a lip wound, although there was no immediate confirmation today The man arrested by police was staying at a hotel in Magaluf.Court officials were not available today to confirm local reports he had been released on bail and detail the conditions attached to his release.Police sources said a man in the group the suspect was with also claimed he had been bottled - but suffered only slight bruising to his cheek and a small lip injury.The man held by police on suspicion of wounding Mr Clark has not been formally charged with any offence as is normal in Spain where charges are only laid shortly before trial.Local paper Ultima Hora said the suspect claimed he punched a man on the nose after being attacked by someone who grabbed hold of him and injured him as he was on the dance floor with his mobile phone in his hand - but insisted to police that man was not footballer Ciaran Clark.Health sources on Majorca confirmed: \u0027A British man injured during an incident in Magaluf in the early hours of Sunday morning was treated in A\u0026ampE at Son Espouses but was not admitted to hospital.\u0027No information about the footballer\u0027s friend could be obtained.Crystal\u0027s Bar brags of being the biggest and best bar on Magaluf\u0027s infamous party strip Punta Ballena.It is popular with sports fans as well as stag do and hen night revellers.It shows live sport during the day and British DJs pump out music till the early hours after nightfall.A social media plug for the bar says: \u0027There\u0027s plenty of choice for groups and the giant fishbowls are a great way to get your night started.

The President greets his supporters at a rally in Ankara. His re-election could cement Turkey\u0027s switch from a parliamentary to a presidential system, which was narrowly approved in a referendum last yearAdditionally, the polls are being held as nationalist sentiment is high following a Turkish military operation into a Syrian border enclave earlier this year that drove away Syrian Kurdish fighters that Turkey brands as terrorists. Turkey has recently intensified air raids on a suspected Kurdish rebel stronghold in northern Iraq, a move that could further rally votes for Erdogan. The most powerful leader since the Turkish republic\u0027s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Erdogan remains popular in Turkey\u0027s conservative and pious heartland. Many see in him a strong leader who stands up to West, who brought stability, oversaw an infrastructure boom, who improved health care and relaxed strict secular laws, for instance allowing women to wear Islamic headscarves in schools and government offices.

His opponents, however, accuse him of curtailing democracy and freedom of speechHis critics say Erdogan, in pursuit of power, is turning the NATO country that once hoped to join the European Union into an increasingly authoritarian state. They accuse him of curtailing democracy and freedom of speech, of jailing opponents, including students, journalists and activists, especially following a failed military coup in 2016. A state of emergency declared after the coup attempt has led to the arrests of some 50,000 and seen more than 110,000 dismissed from government jobs.\u0027Erdogan is the man to deliver,\u0027 Erdogan\u0027s adviser Ilnur Cevik told The Associated Press in an interview, countering accusations that Erdogan is in pursuit of greater powers.\u0027Erdogan does not have absolute power - he has the affection of the people.\u0027The allied opposition - which includes the center-left and pro-secular Republican Peoples\u0027 Party, the center-right Good Party and the small Islamic Felicity Party - has vowed to roll back Erdogan\u0027s presidential system and to improve relations with allies and the European Union.Also challenging Erdogan is the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u0027 Democratic Party, whose charismatic leader is running for president from jail.

She spent time in New York before working as a senior policy adviser for Tony Blair’s government.During her time as a member of the Labour Party, Ardern has been a strong advocate for children, women and the right to have meaning work for every New Zealander.After becoming the MP for the Auckland electorate Mount Albert in 2017 and Leader of the Labour Party in the same year, she was elected PM on October 19 after First Leader Winston Peters announced a coalition. #JacindaMania ensued.Jacinda became New Zealand’s third Prime Minister after Jenny Shipley (1997-1999) and Helen Clark (1999-2008). Months later, she announced that she was pregnant and Winston Peters would take on the role of Acting Prime Minister for six weeks after the birth.      In a statement, the New Zealand Prime Minister added: \u0027I\u0027m sure we\u0027re going through all of the emotions new parents go through, but at the same time feeling so grateful for all the kindness and best wishes from so many people.’Ahead of her leave, PM Ardern had been vocal about her six week departure and said ‘The thing to keep in mind is: I’m not dead.’However, Winston Peters has been causing a stir since the day that she left Wellington and lodged a privacy breach lawsuit against a government department, scuttled a major piece of Labour policy and attacked the leadership of New Zealand’s largest company.Although some believe that the deputy will do a good job, others are pessimistic due to the minister often being described as a populist. However, Peters has been hailed a ‘kingmaker’ after forming the coalition government and merging the centre-left and centre-right political parties.      ‘For young women, the example Ardern is setting is an affirmation that they too can expect to have that choice. For young men, Gayford being the full time carer of a baby sends a powerful message that they too can exercise that choice.‘New Zealand is known for being, by and large, a socially progressive country. Ardern is its third female prime minister it has had three female governors general and women have held significant positions across the public and private spheres. 125 years ago, it became the first country where women won the right to vote.‘Now it is breaking new ground with a prime minister giving birth and her partner becoming a stay-at-home father. But in the context of New Zealand, this is evolutionary, not revolutionary. Overwhelmingly positive interest across the political spectrum is being taken in the addition to the first family.‘What lessons are there in this for our world? In my view, New Zealand is showing that no doors are closed to women, that having a baby while being prime minister can be managed, and that it’s acceptable for male partners to be full-time carers. This is very positive role modelling for the empowerment of women and for gender equality.’Dr Dre\u0027s Marvin Gaye biopic: All you need to knowBring Your Dog to Work Day 2018: Everything you need to knowKSI vs Logan Paul boxing match tickets: When do they go on sale and how to buy themNBA Draft 2018: Everything you need to knowWho is Virgil Abloh?

Each is being held on $12million bail and could face up to life in prison if convicted.The couple was arrested in January after their 17-year-old daughter, who had spent two years planning an escape, climbed out a window and then called 911 to report abuse. By the time police arrived at the house 70 miles southeast of Los Angeles, the two shackled sisters had been hastily released from their chains when police showed up, but a 22-year-old son remained restrained.The young man said he and his siblings had been suspected of stealing food and being disrespectful, Riverside County sheriff\u0027s Det. Thomas Salisbury said during Wednesday\u0027s hearing. The man said he had been tied up with ropes at first but later, after learning to wriggle free, restrained with increasingly larger chains on and off over six years. Sheriff\u0027s deputy Daniel Brown said one daughter told him that she knew her sister had contacted police when she heard a knock at the door and saw flashing lights outside the window.\u0027She said she was finally going to become free,\u0027 Brown said.Senior investigators with the county district attorney\u0027s office testified that doctors and medical records showed some of the children were severely malnourished and had muscle wasting, with some adult children being 32lbs underweight.          Investigators testified that one of the Turpins\u0027 daughters (pictured), aged 11, had the arms the size of an infant The 11-year-old girl who had been shackled to her bed had stunted growth from malnourishment and her arms were the size of an infant\u0027s, investigator Patrick Morris said.In her 20-minute 911 call, the 17-year-old who escaped told the dispatcher: \u0027We don\u0027t really do school. I haven\u0027t finished first grade.\u0027The girl told sheriff\u0027s Deputy Manuel Campos that she hadn\u0027t bathed in a year and that she didn\u0027t know the date or the month, he testified.About two years ago, the mother found out the girl had been watching a Justin Bieber video on a cellphone borrowed from her sister, and started choking her and asked, \u0027do you want to die?\u0027 Campos said.The girl said she didn\u0027t want to die, but she feared she was about to as the choking continued.\u0027Yes you do, yes you do, you do, you want to die,\u0027 the mother said, according to Campos. \u0027You want to die and go to hell.\u0027 There was no breakfast, and recently lunch and dinner had been combined into one meal that included peanut butter and bologna sandwiches, a frozen burrito and chips.The girl said she recently had started refusing the peanut butter sandwiches \u0027because she starts to gag and starts to throw up,\u0027 Campos testified.The teen, who said she hadn’t finished first grade, had difficulty pronouncing some words and spoke like a much younger child.The girl planned her escape for two years and was terrified as she climbed out a window to freedom, according to Campos\u0027 testimony.\u0027She couldn’t even dial 911 because she was so scared that she was shaking,\u0027 he said.She didn’t know the neighborhood and had to read her address to the dispatcher off a piece of paper. The kids were rarely allowed outside, though they went out on Halloween and traveled as a family to Disneyland and Las Vegas, they said.\u0027Sometimes I wake up and I can’t breathe because of how dirty the house is,\u0027 the girl told the woman dispatcher.She said she hadn’t bathed in a year and Campos observed dirt caked on her skin and a stink from being unbathed.           Louise was seen wiping her eyes (not pictured) while listening to a 911 call her 17-year-old daughter  made after escaping their Perris, California, home in January  Claws: Both the husband and wife appeared in court on Wednesday with exceedingly long fingernails (left and right)          What\u0027s so funny? David Turpin had a smile on his face during the hearing in Riverside. He has gotten a shorter haircut behind bars          Despite wiping tears during part of the hearing, she seemed to smile talking to her attorney at other timesThe girl referred to her parents as \u0027mother\u0027 and \u0027father\u0027 because she said it was \u0027more like the Bible days,\u0027 he said.She reported that her father pulled down her pants and put her on his clothed lap in a recliner chair in the TV room when she was 12. She said she didn’t like it and pulled up her pants, and that he told her not tell anyone, Campos said.The children spent most of their time locked in their rooms except for limited meals or using the bathroom.If they didn’t obey strict rules, they were slapped in the face or had their hair pulled, the girl told CamposThe eldest son in the family told authorities discipline in the home included beatings with the leather or buckle end of a belt, said Wade Walsvick, senior investigator for the Riverside County district attorney’s office. Years earlier, when the family lived in Texas, he said the beatings involved \u0027a switch, the paddle and the oar\u0027 and the siblings were sometimes placed in cages.Wednesday\u0027s hearing was held to determine whether the prosecutors have amassed enough evidence to take the case against the Turpins to trial. Authorities said the Turpin children were isolated from each other and locked in different rooms in small groups. They did not have access to televisions or radios but expressed themselves in the hundreds of journals that investigators seized from the home.          Authorities said the Turpin home in Perris (pictured) reeked of human waste, and the evidence of their children\u0027s starvation was obviousMost of the  children were homeschooled, but one of the older boys was allowed to attend classes at Mt San Jacinto Community College.His mother would drive him there, stay outside in the hallway during the class and then take him back home as soon as the class ended, prosecutors said.After they were freed from the home, the children, who ranged in age from 2 to 29, were immediately hospitalized and eventually released. Prosecutors said the abuse was so prolonged the children\u0027s growth was stunted.The current whereabouts of the children is unknown. A spokeswoman for the county\u0027s social services department declined to discuss the case.Jack Osborn, an attorney appointed to represent the couple\u0027s seven adult children, said earlier this year they were \u0027doing well.\u0027           After they were freed from the home, the children, who ranged in age from 2 to 29 (pictured at their parents\u0027 vow renewal ceremony), were immediately hospitalizedThey have participated in music therapy programs, made crafts and world-famous cellist Yo-Yo Ma held a special concert for them. They communicated with their younger siblings over Skype.\u0027They\u0027re happy, they are wanting to move forward, they do not want to dwell on the past and they want their identity to be now and going forward the things they hope to do, the dreams they have. They do not want people to think of them only as a possible victim, but as young adults setting off on their lives,\u0027 he told the Riverside Press-Enterprise newspaper in February.The hearing is scheduled to resume Thursday. "},{"url":null,"title":"World Music Day 2018 need know F te la Musique","story":"World Music Day historyThe history of World Music Day dates back to October 1981 after Jack Lang, the former Minister of Culture in France, appointed composer Maurice Fleuret as Director of Music and Dance within the government agency.Fleuret, after discovering in a study that more than five million French citizens play instruments, started to think up ways of how to get people into the streets to play instruments and celebrate music collectively.

The charity said a number of animals, including these cats, left and right, needed urgent veterinary treatmentThe scale of the operation was discovered by an undercover RSCPA officer.A spokesman for the charity said: \u0027The front room of the property was being used to sell the animals to members of the public but it was when you entered the rest of the house the scale of this operation became apparent.\u0027There were cages and pens containing different breeds of dogs in almost every room, including a litter of puppies in a filthy en-suite bathroom upstairs. In a large garage at the back we found cages of animals stacked on top of each other.\u0027It was clear there were some cats and puppies that needed immediate veterinary treatment and sadly two of the puppies that were rushed to the vets for treatment later died from parvovirus.\u0027There was little sign of proper isolation pens for sick animals or biosecurity measures meaning any animal that passed through this place would be at risk of catching and spreading diseases and parasites.\u0027This was a large money-making operation at the expense of the welfare of the animals and the unsuspecting members of public who thought they were buying healthy, happy puppies.\u0027Kiseliova previously pleaded guilty to fraudulent trading, keeping a pet shop without a licence, keeping a dog breeding establishment without a licence, four charges of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal and three charges of failing to ensure the welfare of an animal.Titas admitted insurance fraud, fraudulent trading, keeping a dog breeding establishment without a licence, four charges of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal and three charges of failing to ensure the welfare of an animal."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/29/22/4BAF984A00000578-0-image-m-31_1525035918335.jpg","title":"Teenager gives selling Nike perfect cloud swoosh photo sky holiday","story":"    John Wilson, 17, was on holiday with his family at Evans Head in New South Wales, Australia, when he managed to take an incredible image of the iconic \u0027swoosh\u0027 or \u0027tick\u0027In fact, the shape is so accurate that most who have seen the picture have accused young John of Photoshopping it - even his pals.Yet the A-levels student is adamant the photo is legitimate and believes he could have made a fortune flogging it to Nike for them to use in advertising - but gave up after finding it too difficult to get in touch with them.John, originally from Bedfordshire but now living in Brisbane, Australia, said: \u0027It was just too good to miss.Six male Nike executives are forced out after female...EXCLUSIVE: \u0027It\u0027s not a camera, it\u0027s an X-ray machine\u0027:...Meet the Nike-wearing 98-year-old nun and Loyola-Chicago...Former Nike exec  becomes a HERMIT on Ohio pig farm to cope...Share this article\u0027I could have made a stack tonne selling this to Nike. \u0027I looked into contacting Nike directly but it was pretty hard so I gave up but it would have been nice to see what they thought of it.\u0027I wanted to tag them on Instagram but I didn\u0027t think they would see it.

It wasn\u0027t moving very fast so we had about 30 seconds taking pictures. \u0027We were all really shocked at the definition, it was perfect.\u0027When you try and draw a Nike tick by hand you never get it right but this cloud was literally perfect in shape. \u0027There were no planes in the sky, it was just how it had happened by pure chance.\u0027 After sharing the image online, multiple commenters told him he should have sold his image to Nike for them to use in their adverts.However not everyone was so quick to believe the picture was real.John said: \u0027When I shared it online, some said that the photo simply didn\u0027t look real. Even when I showed it to my friends, they all said it looked fake.\u0027To be honest, strangers on the internet believed me more readily than my friends, which was a bit odd.\u0027But I kept on saying that honestly, it was real. I managed to convince most my friends but some still don\u0027t reckon it\u0027s real.           John had been out with his family and stopped at the spot at Evans Head beach where the Nike tick appeared perfectly in the clouds  The cloud above Evans Head bizarrely sits at right angles to any other clouds in the sky and forms the perfect shape of the sport\u0027s brand\u0027s world-renowned logo\u0027But I\u0027m nowhere near good enough at Photoshop to do that. \u0027Everyone who has seen it has been pretty impressed with it and on one social media website where I shared it, it was seen by a million people. I thought that was crazy.\u0027I think people generally believe me that I took the photo like that now, but it often takes a lot of explaining.\u0027I actually held the camera on a bit of an angle when I took the photo to make sure it looked as close to the Nike tick as possible.\u0027Nike were contacted for comment as this story went live."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/21/17/4D7CC82A00000578-5870823-image-a-135_1529597782324.jpg","title":"Revellers descend Isle Wight Festival Britain prepares 75F weekend","story":"    Festival-goers donned their denim shorts as they arrived at the Isle of Wight festival today           One reveller opted for a daring crop top, while her friend opted for a bright printed jacket           Revellers came prepared with plenty of beers as they arrived on day one of the festival          Festival-goers were seen lugging in their camping gear as they descended on the campsiteFrustrated Ben Clements said he had even seen people fainting, with just one sniffer dog being used to check people\u0027s bags as they enter the festival grounds, today.The 22-year-old, of Poole, Dorset, said: \u0027It is a shambles, we have been queuing for four hours and have moved about ten yards.

Another told her they were learning how to celebrate the Fourth of July.They each signed to flag to give to her. Aides began to roll it up but the plan changed. Melania Trump signed it herself before leaving, to leave behind as a gift.She also asked what kinds of music they like.\u0027They like to dance a lot,\u0027 the teacher said. Mrs. Trump asked for a demonstration but then laughed. \u0027This is a serious class.... so study hard\u0027 and be kind to each other, she told them and added that friendship  \u0027is very important.\u0027She then moved to the nurses office for a briefing on medical care. Grisham said the first lady wanted see the facilities for herself and to thank the staff working in them.\u0027Her goals are to thank law enforcement and social services providers for their hard work, lend support and hear more on how the administration can build upon the already existing efforts to reunite children with their families,\u0027 Grisham said.Her visit comes amid a political firestorm for the Trump administration. President Donald Trump took heavy criticism from both sides of the aisle, former presidents and his own wife about the \u0027zero tolerance\u0027 immigration policy that resulted in migrant children being separated from their families at the border.Melania Trump issued a rare public statement on the issue over the weekend, inserting herself into a policy issue that she had previously been silent upon.Her next visit was scheduled to be the Ursula Border Patrol Processing Center, a Customs and Border PatrolDepartment of Homeland Security intake center where migrant families spend a few days.But that was canceled due to flooding.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar traveled with her.Her spokesperson said the First Lady will continue to be a vocal presence on the issue as administration officials try to work out ways to reunited children and their families after President Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday.\u0027While we\u0027re going through that process she\u0027s going to lend her support and promote family reunification and I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll continue to give her husband opinions on what she\u0027s thinking along the way,\u0027 Grisham said of the visit.Trump in fresh broadside on immigration as he claims...Texas migrant detention center scrambles to source 5,100...Share this articleFrench priest slaps crying baby during baptism when he won\u0027t calm downSajid Javid frustrated by lack of info for Brits in the EUSpot of turbulence!

When she announced her policy agenda four days before she had a kidney procedure, she called it \u0027Be Best\u0027 and said she would help children become the best they can be.She appears most comfortable when she is with children. Often bending down to speak with them and smiling broadly at them and their questions.The visit also marks a rare solo public trip for Melania Trump, who eased into her role as first lady and then disappeared from the public eye for 25 days in May after she under went a kidney operation.And her comes after President Donald Trump credited her and daughter Ivanka for helping change his mind about separating children from their families.President Trump, when he signed his executive order on the issue on Wednesday, indicated that lobbying from Ivanka, who showed him pictures of the caged and kenneled children, and wife Melania had caused him to have a change in heart.\u0027Ivanka feels very strongly about it. My wife feels very strongly about it. I feel very strongly about it. I think anybody with a heart would feel very strongly about it,\u0027 he said.The first lady also saw the photos from the border and heard the recordings of children being separated from their families.\u0027She\u0027s seen the images. She\u0027s heard the recordings,\u0027 Grisham said. \u0027She was on top of the situation before any of that came out. She was concerned about it.\u0027Grisham said Mrs. Trump saw the images of kids behind chain link fence at an intake facility.\u0027The images struck her, as a mother, as a human being.\u0027Melania Trump asked her staff on Tuesday to plan a trip as soon as possible – before President Trump signed the executive order and Grisham said she wasn\u0027t sure if Mrs. Trump knew that the order was coming.          Mobile: The First Lady\u0027s rare solo trip outside Washington D.C. to a children\u0027s center where she looked at artworks made by detained children came after her husband entered a political firestorm over illegal immigrant families being separated  Public expression: The First Lady\u0027s involvement in the border separation crisis marks a new phase in her public profile\u0027I don\u0027t know what she knew. She knew what she wanted to do and she told us,\u0027 Grisham said.\u0027She wanted to see everything for herself…. She supports family reunification. She thinks that it\u0027s important that children stay with their families.\u0027\u0027This was 100 percent her idea. She absolutely wanted to come.\u0027And it was her idea to visit before her husband signed his executive order, Grisham said, and she had no second thoughts after the order was signed.\u0027She wants to see what\u0027s happening for herself and she wants to lend her support, executive order or not. The executive order certainly is helping pave the way a little bit, but there\u0027s still a lot to be done.\u0027President Trump supported this trip but he didn\u0027t send her.\u0027This was her decision. She told her staff she wanted to go and we made that happen. He is supportive of it but she told him, \u0027I\u0027m headed down to Texas,\u0027 and he supported it.\u0027\u0027She wants to see these children and she wants to help children. It\u0027s not about anything more than that…. She wants to see what\u0027s real. She wants to see a realistic view.\u0027The immigration debate is a rare public policy issue that Melania Trump has inserted herself into.The first lady issued a rare public statement on Sunday about her husband\u0027s \u0027zero tolerance\u0027 policy.It appeared to break with the Trump administration\u0027s stance.Grisham said in a statement  that \u0027Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform\u0027.\u0027She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.\u0027Melania Trump is an immigration herself. She was born in Yugoslavia, what is now Slovenia and came to New York City in 1996. She became a permanent resident of the U.S. in 2001 and became a citizen in 2006.She is the first naturalized U.S. citizen to become First Lady of the United States. Asked if her immigration background influenced Mrs. Trump\u0027s views, Grisham said she didn\u0027t know.\u0027I don\u0027t know that it plays into her thinking but I can tell you guys that when she came into this country she did it legally and she feels that everybody should enter the country legally,\u0027 she said."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/21/16/4D7DF55400000578-0-image-m-33_1529594767291.jpg","title":"Bouncing dog appears act like kangaroo continues jump down","story":"The dog could be seen bouncing up and down over the side of the garden fenceThe funny video was uploaded to YouTube and has already racked up several hundred views.The clip begins in an unsuspecting way with just a view of the house and the surrounding plants and trash cans before suddenly the bouncing pooch manages to peek over the top. The dog then continues to bounce up and down, appearing at a different spot each time with his ears hilariously flapping in the wind.Occasionaally the pet seems to be looking in another direction as he takes in all of his surroundings as to what lies beyond the fence.Either way, the person behind the camera filming the bizarre sight, started chuckling with delight as the dog begins to bark with with pleasure. That\u0027s the spot!

This year the president faces a more united opposition in his bid to continue as Turkey\u0027s leader It has been focusing on past achievements and making odd campaign promises such as the creation of neighborhood \u0027reading houses\u0027 offering free tea and cakes. Analysts even speak of the possibility of Justice and Development losing its majority in Parliament.\u0027(Erdogan) remains by far the most popular politician in Turkey,\u0027 said Sinan Ulgen of the Istanbul-based EDAM think tank. \u0027He is still the one that is the most likely to be elected, but it is not a foregone conclusion.\u0027Erdogan called the presidential and parliamentary elections more than a year earlier than scheduled amid signs that the Turkish economy may be heading toward a downturn. Despite strong growth figures, inflation and unemployment have hit double-digit figures while the lira has lost some 20 percent of its value against the dollar since the start of the year.  The President greets his supporters at a rally in Ankara. His re-election could cement Turkey\u0027s switch from a parliamentary to a presidential system, which was narrowly approved in a referendum last yearAdditionally, the polls are being held as nationalist sentiment is high following a Turkish military operation into a Syrian border enclave earlier this year that drove away Syrian Kurdish fighters that Turkey brands as terrorists. Turkey has recently intensified air raids on a suspected Kurdish rebel stronghold in northern Iraq, a move that could further rally votes for Erdogan. The most powerful leader since the Turkish republic\u0027s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Erdogan remains popular in Turkey\u0027s conservative and pious heartland. Many see in him a strong leader who stands up to West, who brought stability, oversaw an infrastructure boom, who improved health care and relaxed strict secular laws, for instance allowing women to wear Islamic headscarves in schools and government offices.

His opponents, however, accuse him of curtailing democracy and freedom of speechHis critics say Erdogan, in pursuit of power, is turning the NATO country that once hoped to join the European Union into an increasingly authoritarian state. They accuse him of curtailing democracy and freedom of speech, of jailing opponents, including students, journalists and activists, especially following a failed military coup in 2016. A state of emergency declared after the coup attempt has led to the arrests of some 50,000 and seen more than 110,000 dismissed from government jobs.\u0027Erdogan is the man to deliver,\u0027 Erdogan\u0027s adviser Ilnur Cevik told The Associated Press in an interview, countering accusations that Erdogan is in pursuit of greater powers.\u0027Erdogan does not have absolute power - he has the affection of the people.\u0027The allied opposition - which includes the center-left and pro-secular Republican Peoples\u0027 Party, the center-right Good Party and the small Islamic Felicity Party - has vowed to roll back Erdogan\u0027s presidential system and to improve relations with allies and the European Union.Also challenging Erdogan is the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u0027 Democratic Party, whose charismatic leader is running for president from jail.

Already in control of a majority of Turkey\u0027s media, Erdogan\u0027s government has changed electoral rules, raising fears that the elections may not be fair. The changes allow government officials to control ballot stations, for ballot stations to be moved to new locations on security grounds and for ballot papers lacking an official stamp to be counted as valid.Ismail Buyukcakar, who played soccer alongside Erdogan in the early 1970s in Istanbul\u0027s Camialti team, recalls a young man who had leadership qualities and oozed confidence.\u0027He is a good fortune for Turkey.

Each is being held on $12million bail and could face up to life in prison if convicted.The couple was arrested in January after their 17-year-old daughter, who had spent two years planning an escape, climbed out a window and then called 911 to report abuse. By the time police arrived at the house 70 miles southeast of Los Angeles, the two shackled sisters had been hastily released from their chains when police showed up, but a 22-year-old son remained restrained.The young man said he and his siblings had been suspected of stealing food and being disrespectful, Riverside County sheriff\u0027s Det. Thomas Salisbury said during Wednesday\u0027s hearing. The man said he had been tied up with ropes at first but later, after learning to wriggle free, restrained with increasingly larger chains on and off over six years. Sheriff\u0027s deputy Daniel Brown said one daughter told him that she knew her sister had contacted police when she heard a knock at the door and saw flashing lights outside the window.\u0027She said she was finally going to become free,\u0027 Brown said.Senior investigators with the county district attorney\u0027s office testified that doctors and medical records showed some of the children were severely malnourished and had muscle wasting, with some adult children being 32lbs underweight.          Investigators testified that one of the Turpins\u0027 daughters (pictured), aged 11, had the arms the size of an infant The 11-year-old girl who had been shackled to her bed had stunted growth from malnourishment and her arms were the size of an infant\u0027s, investigator Patrick Morris said.In her 20-minute 911 call, the 17-year-old who escaped told the dispatcher: \u0027We don\u0027t really do school. I haven\u0027t finished first grade.\u0027The girl told sheriff\u0027s Deputy Manuel Campos that she hadn\u0027t bathed in a year and that she didn\u0027t know the date or the month, he testified.About two years ago, the mother found out the girl had been watching a Justin Bieber video on a cellphone borrowed from her sister, and started choking her and asked, \u0027do you want to die?\u0027 Campos said.The girl said she didn\u0027t want to die, but she feared she was about to as the choking continued.\u0027Yes you do, yes you do, you do, you want to die,\u0027 the mother said, according to Campos. \u0027You want to die and go to hell.\u0027 There was no breakfast, and recently lunch and dinner had been combined into one meal that included peanut butter and bologna sandwiches, a frozen burrito and chips.The girl said she recently had started refusing the peanut butter sandwiches \u0027because she starts to gag and starts to throw up,\u0027 Campos testified.The teen, who said she hadn’t finished first grade, had difficulty pronouncing some words and spoke like a much younger child.The girl planned her escape for two years and was terrified as she climbed out a window to freedom, according to Campos\u0027 testimony.\u0027She couldn’t even dial 911 because she was so scared that she was shaking,\u0027 he said.She didn’t know the neighborhood and had to read her address to the dispatcher off a piece of paper. The kids were rarely allowed outside, though they went out on Halloween and traveled as a family to Disneyland and Las Vegas, they said.\u0027Sometimes I wake up and I can’t breathe because of how dirty the house is,\u0027 the girl told the woman dispatcher.She said she hadn’t bathed in a year and Campos observed dirt caked on her skin and a stink from being unbathed.           Louise was seen wiping her eyes (not pictured) while listening to a 911 call her 17-year-old daughter  made after escaping their Perris, California, home in January  Claws: Both the husband and wife appeared in court on Wednesday with exceedingly long fingernails (left and right)          What\u0027s so funny? David Turpin had a smile on his face during the hearing in Riverside. He has gotten a shorter haircut behind bars          Despite wiping tears during part of the hearing, she seemed to smile talking to her attorney at other timesThe girl referred to her parents as \u0027mother\u0027 and \u0027father\u0027 because she said it was \u0027more like the Bible days,\u0027 he said.She reported that her father pulled down her pants and put her on his clothed lap in a recliner chair in the TV room when she was 12. She said she didn’t like it and pulled up her pants, and that he told her not tell anyone, Campos said.The children spent most of their time locked in their rooms except for limited meals or using the bathroom.If they didn’t obey strict rules, they were slapped in the face or had their hair pulled, the girl told CamposThe eldest son in the family told authorities discipline in the home included beatings with the leather or buckle end of a belt, said Wade Walsvick, senior investigator for the Riverside County district attorney’s office. Years earlier, when the family lived in Texas, he said the beatings involved \u0027a switch, the paddle and the oar\u0027 and the siblings were sometimes placed in cages.Wednesday\u0027s hearing was held to determine whether the prosecutors have amassed enough evidence to take the case against the Turpins to trial. Authorities said the Turpin children were isolated from each other and locked in different rooms in small groups. They did not have access to televisions or radios but expressed themselves in the hundreds of journals that investigators seized from the home.          Authorities said the Turpin home in Perris (pictured) reeked of human waste, and the evidence of their children\u0027s starvation was obviousMost of the  children were homeschooled, but one of the older boys was allowed to attend classes at Mt San Jacinto Community College.His mother would drive him there, stay outside in the hallway during the class and then take him back home as soon as the class ended, prosecutors said.After they were freed from the home, the children, who ranged in age from 2 to 29, were immediately hospitalized and eventually released. Prosecutors said the abuse was so prolonged the children\u0027s growth was stunted.The current whereabouts of the children is unknown. A spokeswoman for the county\u0027s social services department declined to discuss the case.Jack Osborn, an attorney appointed to represent the couple\u0027s seven adult children, said earlier this year they were \u0027doing well.\u0027           After they were freed from the home, the children, who ranged in age from 2 to 29 (pictured at their parents\u0027 vow renewal ceremony), were immediately hospitalizedThey have participated in music therapy programs, made crafts and world-famous cellist Yo-Yo Ma held a special concert for them. They communicated with their younger siblings over Skype.\u0027They\u0027re happy, they are wanting to move forward, they do not want to dwell on the past and they want their identity to be now and going forward the things they hope to do, the dreams they have. They do not want people to think of them only as a possible victim, but as young adults setting off on their lives,\u0027 he told the Riverside Press-Enterprise newspaper in February.The hearing is scheduled to resume Thursday. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/21/15/4D7C155400000578-5870187-image-m-130_1529590128549.jpg","title":"Cambridge University students topless celebrate annual Kings College Ball","story":"    Elite students at Cambridge University bared their breasts and bums at their annual May Ball event on Wednesday            Many of the female undergraduates dressed in their underwear or went topless at the King\u0027s College ball, which saw 1,500 partying the night away    This student wore an exposed cage mini skirt, showing off her under garments on Wednesday night           Students got into the space spirit with plenty of glitter, body paints and risque outfits          The costumes for the fancy dress code ranged from bondage-styled, glittery and outer space themed           A group of Cambridge students pose before the annual event, where the theme was Music of the Spheres           Other female students wore bikinis, underwear and bondage-style outfits, which showed off their legs and bumsMusic of the Spheres is a concept from ancient Greece, where Pythagoras and his devout followers believed that celestial bodies made music.Music was not thought to be literal, but rather a concept that tied together, harmony, maths and region.  Students got into the space spirit with plenty of glitter, body paints and risque outfits.\u0027Tinder for teens\u0027 app encouraging kids as young as ten to...\u0027I\u0027m lucky, I could have been Sally Jones\u0027: Former glamour...Instagram in sexism row after shutting down university\u0027s...Share this articleOne girl went topless and covered her breasts with silver sequins, whilst another wore a black bra and knickers, with stockings and a skirt fashioned out of wire.Other female students wore bikinis, underwear and bondage-style outfits, which showed off their legs and bums.Many male students were dressed in drag with skirts, wigs and fishnet stockings or long-flowing dresses.Tickets for the sell-out ball cost £70 and the headliner was Mr Scruff, who played a three-hour set.

There was no hidden message.\u0027          The jacket contained the extraordinary message printed on the back in broad, white, paint-like strokes: \u0027I don\u0027t care, do u?\u0027          Extraordinary visit: The First Lady signed an American flag greeting her at Upbring New Hope Children\u0027s Shelter after she toured the facility          Taking part: The First Lady signed her own name at the bottom of the handmade stars and stripes welcome sign at the children\u0027s center          Side by side: The First lady traveled with Alex Azar, Secretary of Health and Human Services, for the trip which was also to a border processing center          Explanation: Officials from the Upbring New Hope Children\u0027s Center spoke to the First Lady before she toured the facility to meet children          Round table talks: Melania Trump heard from doctors, social workers and law enforcement at the Upbring New Hope Children\u0027s Center in McAllen, Texas          Inspection: Melania Trump toured the child shelter in McAllen, Texas, where 55 children are being held after crossing the border. The \u0027majority\u0027 did so unaccompanied, but it is unclear how many were taken from their parents          Artwork: The First Lady, making her first solo trip outside Washington D.C. since she had kidney surgery, looked at art on the walls of the children\u0027s shelter in McAllen, Texas, where children are being held after crossing the border          Inside the facility: The First Lady was shown how the children are cared for, including decorations showing the pilgrims arriving on the Mayflower. It was unclear if these had been made by the children          Austere: This is one of the bedrooms where children are held in the facility visited by the First Lady.           Visit: Melania Trump made an unexpected trip to Upbring New Hope Children\u0027s Shelter, where 55 children are currently being held          Concern: The First Lady said she was at the shelter to say \u0027thank you for your hard work, your compassion, your kindness in these hard times\u0027          Melania Trump arrived in Texas to visit children at a \u0027tender age\u0027 shelter where children including some separated from their families at the border are being held          Surprise: The visit was not disclosed in advance but comes after the First Lady pressured her husband to end the policy of forced separationsShe also asked officials what kind of shape the children are in when they arrive. \u0027I\u0027ve heard they are very happy. They love to study. They love school,\u0027 the First Lady said.Additionally, she wanted to know how long the children stayed at the center and if they were without the parents.Officials told her the majority of the children had arrived unaccompanied - meaning it is unclear how many were victims of family separation.During the visit, the first lady interacted with dozens of kids, visiting three classrooms. But, according to a White House pool report, per ground rules set by the White House there is no audio or photos of these interactions.\u0027She visited with minor children so it was to protect their safety,\u0027 Grisham explained to the DailyMail.com in a statement.In the first classroom, Mrs. Trump shook hands with the children. There was laughter and lots of smiles, including three girls in the back row, hairs in buns, who were smiling a lot. A boy in the front row had a Spanish-English dictionary in front of him. Many of the kids wore gray T-shirts that said \u0027We Are One\u0027 with we in red, are in white and one in blue.Mrs. Trump asked inidually where they were from, how long they\u0027d been there. She spoke in English. Some responded in English. Others, the teacher translated for Mrs. Trump. As she left she said, \u0027Be kind and nice to other, ok? Nice to meet you.\u0027 And then she helped them resume their counting exercise they\u0027d been doing before she got there, chanting \u002762, 63, 64, 65.\u0027In the next classroom, the children were learning about angles and lines. The teacher explained a contest to build model bridges to Mrs. Trump. Kids worked in groups of four and whichever bridge held the most weight wins.\u0027Bubye. Good luck,\u0027 the first lady said. The kids applauded as she left. In the third classroom, a poster of U.S. presidents that went through George W. Bush was on the wall to the right of the door. A hand painted U.S. flag covered the white wipe board. It read \u0027Welcome! First lady.\u0027There were 12 kids in this room and all were girls. Mrs. Trump asked where they were from. One said she\u0027d been here for two months. Another told her they were learning how to celebrate the Fourth of July.They each signed to flag to give to her. Aides began to roll it up but the plan changed. Melania Trump signed it herself before leaving, to leave behind as a gift.She also asked what kinds of music they like.\u0027They like to dance a lot,\u0027 the teacher said. Mrs. Trump asked for a demonstration but then laughed. \u0027This is a serious class.... so study hard\u0027 and be kind to each other, she told them and added that friendship  \u0027is very important.\u0027She then moved to the nurses office for a briefing on medical care. Grisham said the first lady wanted see the facilities for herself and to thank the staff working in them.\u0027Her goals are to thank law enforcement and social services providers for their hard work, lend support and hear more on how the administration can build upon the already existing efforts to reunite children with their families,\u0027 Grisham said.Her visit comes amid a political firestorm for the Trump administration. President Donald Trump took heavy criticism from both sides of the aisle, former presidents and his own wife about the \u0027zero tolerance\u0027 immigration policy that resulted in migrant children being separated from their families at the border.Melania Trump issued a rare public statement on the issue over the weekend, inserting herself into a policy issue that she had previously been silent upon.Her next visit was scheduled to be the Ursula Border Patrol Processing Center, a Customs and Border PatrolDepartment of Homeland Security intake center where migrant families spend a few days.But that was canceled due to flooding.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar traveled with her.Her spokesperson said the First Lady will continue to be a vocal presence on the issue as administration officials try to work out ways to reunited children and their families after President Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday.\u0027While we\u0027re going through that process she\u0027s going to lend her support and promote family reunification and I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll continue to give her husband opinions on what she\u0027s thinking along the way,\u0027 Grisham said of the visit.Trump in fresh broadside on immigration as he claims...Texas migrant detention center scrambles to source 5,100...Share this articleFrench priest slaps crying baby during baptism when he won\u0027t calm downSajid Javid frustrated by lack of info for Brits in the EUSpot of turbulence!

When she announced her policy agenda four days before she had a kidney procedure, she called it \u0027Be Best\u0027 and said she would help children become the best they can be.She appears most comfortable when she is with children. Often bending down to speak with them and smiling broadly at them and their questions.The visit also marks a rare solo public trip for Melania Trump, who eased into her role as first lady and then disappeared from the public eye for 25 days in May after she under went a kidney operation.And her comes after President Donald Trump credited her and daughter Ivanka for helping change his mind about separating children from their families.President Trump, when he signed his executive order on the issue on Wednesday, indicated that lobbying from Ivanka, who showed him pictures of the caged and kenneled children, and wife Melania had caused him to have a change in heart.\u0027Ivanka feels very strongly about it. My wife feels very strongly about it. I feel very strongly about it. I think anybody with a heart would feel very strongly about it,\u0027 he said.The first lady also saw the photos from the border and heard the recordings of children being separated from their families.\u0027She\u0027s seen the images. She\u0027s heard the recordings,\u0027 Grisham said. \u0027She was on top of the situation before any of that came out. She was concerned about it.\u0027Grisham said Mrs. Trump saw the images of kids behind chain link fence at an intake facility.\u0027The images struck her, as a mother, as a human being.\u0027Melania Trump asked her staff on Tuesday to plan a trip as soon as possible – before President Trump signed the executive order and Grisham said she wasn\u0027t sure if Mrs. Trump knew that the order was coming.          Mobile: The First Lady\u0027s rare solo trip outside Washington D.C. to a children\u0027s center where she looked at artworks made by detained children came after her husband entered a political firestorm over illegal immigrant families being separated  Public expression: The First Lady\u0027s involvement in the border separation crisis marks a new phase in her public profile\u0027I don\u0027t know what she knew. She knew what she wanted to do and she told us,\u0027 Grisham said.\u0027She wanted to see everything for herself…. She supports family reunification. She thinks that it\u0027s important that children stay with their families.\u0027\u0027This was 100 percent her idea. She absolutely wanted to come.\u0027And it was her idea to visit before her husband signed his executive order, Grisham said, and she had no second thoughts after the order was signed.\u0027She wants to see what\u0027s happening for herself and she wants to lend her support, executive order or not. The executive order certainly is helping pave the way a little bit, but there\u0027s still a lot to be done.\u0027President Trump supported this trip but he didn\u0027t send her.\u0027This was her decision. She told her staff she wanted to go and we made that happen. He is supportive of it but she told him, \u0027I\u0027m headed down to Texas,\u0027 and he supported it.\u0027\u0027She wants to see these children and she wants to help children. It\u0027s not about anything more than that…. She wants to see what\u0027s real.

Scarcely a year passes without the claimed discovery of a previously overlooked work by Leonardo, and argument still rages over the authenticity of the heavily restored Salvator Mundi which became the most expensive painting in the world when it sold for more than $450m (£340m), at a Christie’s auction in New York last winter.Kemp, emeritus professor of art history at Oxford University, who thought the “vermicelli like” hair particularly unconvincing, told the : “The chance of its being by Leonardo is less than zero. The silly season for Leonardo never closes.”Very few genuine works by Leonardo survive, and almost all are in museum collections, partly because his academic and scientific interests were so wide, including inventions such as flying machines and siege engines: he left a trail of unfinished projects throughout his career.The tile was presented like a holy relic, encased in glass, at a press conference in Rome. According to the Italian news agency Adnkronos, Prof Ernesto Solari, who has written extensively on the Renaissance genius, claims that his research with Ivana Bonfantin, a handwriting expert, proves that the tile bears clues leading to the polymath. There are secret inscriptions including a sequence of numbers, and Leonardo’s signature back to front – his later notebooks are full of his mirror-writing – together making up a coded message translated as: “I, Leonardo da Vinci, born in 1452, represented myself as the Archangel Gabriel in 1471.”Solari claims that extensive scientific dating tests including thermoluminescence bear out the 15th century date of the tile, which is owned by an aristocratic family in Ravello. He believes the tile was fired in the pottery kiln of Leonardo’s paternal grandparents, although by 1471 Leonardo, who was illegitimate, had left the home in Vinci where he was brought up, and completed years apprenticed to the workshop of Verrocchio.One recently claimed and fiercely contested Leonardo discovery, La Bella Principessa, which if genuine had been valued at up to £100m, has been counter-claimed by the forger Shaun Greenhalgh, whose work has fooled many experts. He insisted the drawing is his work, a portrait of Sally, a checkout operator in the Co-op branch at Bromley Cross in Bolton."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87226d4030cb88d1f48d3cd9a82bbf11ecd22c40/119_867_1848_1109/master/1848.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a05a5da10efa277c9f7e323e6d97cccc","title":"metropolitan museum art african american portraits exhibition","story":"At a new exhibition at the politan Museum of Art studio portraits of anonymous black Americans give a rarely seen view of life at a time of changeHis spellbinding words are the inspiration for the exhibition African American Portraits: Photographs from the 1940s and 1950s, which opens at the politan Museum of Art in New York City on 26 June. More than 150 studio portraits from the mid-20th century will offer a rarely seen view of African Americans during the second world war, a time of cultural change, uncertainty and growth of the middle class.“These photos have a certain quality and beguiling characteristic that separate themselves from the huge population of images we see every day,” said Jeff Rosenheim, the Met’s photography curator. “They tell stories that other stories from the same time do not.”The exhibition features classic photo portraits of parents with their newborns, or standing proudly in lavish fur coats, suits and ties. Standing before picturesque, painted scenery of forests, many are smiling while wearing their Sunday best, like feathered hats, pearl earrings and leather gloves, or clutching their purses with perfect nail polish.However, most of the photographers and their subjects featured in this exhibition are unknown, making it an exhibition of anonymous portraits said Rosenheim, who is the author of 10 books on Depression-era photojournalist Walker Evans. He also previously curated the Met’s Photography and the American Civil War exhibition from 2013. One of the few known studios in the exhibition is Daisy Studio, which was on the historic Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee. Many of Daisy’s photos (which are marked by the brand’s logo on a wooden slab in the bottom left corner of each photo) show young people in the south taking their portraits before enlisting in the war.“They’re leaving home for the first time, their future is uncertain,” said Rosenheim. “Without too much fanfare and with economy of means, it makes these pictures just stunning. They allow us to look at a time and a place that changed the country. It’s on the cusp of the civil rights era and there was great stress because of the war, but it was also a time of introspection.”But the people in the photos are anonymous and there is no real way to trace them, besides the Met’s visitors being able to recognize their loved ones. As most of the photos here show people going off to war in their late teens and early 20s, and having been photographed in the 1940s and 1950s, the subjects could be in their 80s or 90s today.“We hope that with the public’s attention, we can identify some of the subjects, as most of them are unknown,” said Rosenheim. “People might be able to recognize a family member or a friend and attach a name to these faces.”These photos build on the museum’s ever-growing photography portraiture collection, which starts with the 1840s and continues to the present. They were acquired by the Met between 2015 and 2017 from the Rose Bowl flea market in Pasadena, California, though many were believed to be photographed in the midwestern and southern cities of Memphis, New Orleans and Kansas.“The power and meaning of these collections are sites of collective memory,” said Rosenheim. “Most of the people are at the end of a long life right now and the photos are moving around as part of their natural progress.”It was a tradition to go to photo studios and pose in a new military uniform, either alone or with parents, siblings or loved ones, which would then be printed and mailed to the soldiers and sailors abroad as a memory.“It was a time people were more thinking about the fragility of life,” said Rosenheim.Photo studios thrived during Pearl Harbor and during the 1950s, right before mass media culture took over in America. “It’s a sweet spot,” said Rosenheim.The fashion of the time was utilitarian but stylish. While many posed in military garb, others show women wearing smart A-line dresses with plastic handbags, whimsical brooches, stylish wristwatches and high heels.It was an act of personal inidualism going to a photo studio. “For those iniduals who chose to pose for themselves, it was an act of self-expression,” said Rosenheim. “These pictures show that it was a time of transition for these iniduals they are choosing to pose for their own reasons – it’s not because their parents or the military told them to do so.”Some of the photos are hand-painted with color, whether it’s the background to give the portrait more life, or as makeup, like plump red lip color for the women. Rosenheim explains that studio photographers could make extra money by applying color to photos by hand, which would help increase their revenue.Just as the population in the south was segregated, so was the military. “There was the civil rights struggle for African Americans, not just voting rights but every other freedom,” said Rosenheim. “In these pictures, we see them in reflection of where they are and what their conditions are.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf195bbaf6ef1708068fb6d3b062091c1027b0e7/0_467_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee761239b1eec98193a467d593c2cf8c","title":"spirit north john kippin english heritage in pictures","story":"Historic England has commissioned the photographer John Kippin to create a series of images that capture the region’s multifaceted identity and cultural significance.

Beyond advances in the manufacture of clothing, the whims of fashion, and the occasional fad – who remembers Levi’s twisted seam? – cotton has remained cotton, and polyester is still polyester.But an award-winning Italian design duo is trying to realise the potential of smart technology in clothing to improve lives.Emanuela Corti and Ivan Parati, who met while studying at the Polytechnic University of Milan, have developed Sensewear, a collection of smart clothing and accessories for people who suffer from SPD. Also known as sensory integration difficulties, SPD can affect the way people, particularly those on the autism spectrum, process everyday stimuli, from light to touch.Their innovative work won Corti and Parati an AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award as part of the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme, which aims to identify inidual champions, innovators and organisations that are creating exciting and pioneering health tech. In addition to winning awards, Corti and Parati’s work has also gained the attention of research academics and manufacturers in Italy.“If it is not treated effectively, it can result in clumsiness, behavioural problems, anxiety, depression or failure at school,” says Corti, a product designer specialising in textiles and furniture. She says hypersensitivity is often part of SPD, which can result in an enhanced sensitivity to sounds, smells and physical contact. “The textures, stitches and labels in regular clothes can cause unsustainably painful reactions,” she says. Left untreated, these symptoms can be disabling, leading to social isolation, anxiety and low self-esteem.The couple, who now have a young daughter, started with comparatively low-tech solutions, looking at the potential for 3D knitting processes, for example, to reduce potential rubbing points. They also looked at ways to redesign – or to build into clothing – some of the specialised toys and medical accessories already available. “Our focus was on incorporating those therapies into everyday objects that would not stigmatise the user as a disabled person,” Corti says. “We wanted to create invisible magic.”But the designers also wanted to think big. What if the elements of a wardrobe could talk to each other? For this, Corti and Parati looked at some of the smart clothing that is starting to become available, typically now targeted at the fitness market, such as Nadi X smart yoga leggings, which pulse on different muscles to encourage correct positions, and the sports vests that measures an athlete’s heart rate and position.“Our smart T-shirt will collect vital data – such as heart rate, breath frequency and movement – which is processed by an app to indicate the stress level of the wearer. It can then trigger the functionalities of other garments in the collection,” says Corti.One such garment is an inflatable pullover, capable of delivering a targeted “hug” to a wearer in need. “Deep pressure or deep touch pressure therapy (DTP) is a firm, tactile sensory input that can consist of firm hugs, stroking or cuddling,” says Corti. “It can have a calming effect on children and adults. Many people affected by autism refuse physical contact with others, but might be happy with a mechanical surrogate.” Other Sensewear innovations include Biteme, a biteable silicon necklace that measures pressure, and an aromatic scarf that can emit familiar, comforting scents.“This is a visionary concept that materialises ideas initially described by Mary Temple Grandin,” says Cesare Furlanello, head of the research group at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, and an expert in the way machine learning can be applied to biomedical and environmental data. Grandin, now 70, is a US professor of animal science and campaigner for autism awareness. She specialises in the emotional as well as physical welfare of livestock, and also invented a mechanical “hug box” for humans, after noticing how confined cattle calmed down before being inoculated.“As a child, I craved to feel the comfort of being held, but I would pull away when people hugged me,” Grandin wrote in 1992 in a description of the machine, a sort of pneumatic cocoon with pressurised padding that allowed her to control her own hugging. She suffered panic attacks throughout her teenage years before building the device in early adulthood. “Gradually, my tolerance of being held by the squeeze machine grew. Knowing that I could initiate the pressure, and stop it if the stimulation became too intense, helped me to reduce the oversensitivity of my nervous system.”Medical vests that replicate this mechanism have already been developed, but Corti’s priority is to make smart clothing that looks cool. “If you have a difficulty you don’t want people to stare at you, right? You don’t want to feel different,” she says. This summer, a team including Furlanello will introduce some of the Sensewear range to children with autism, to explore its potential to make their lives easier. “Patients are very often reluctant to ‘wear’ cumbersome and ugly scientific devices,” says Furlanello, “but we expect Sensewear smart clothes will be much more acceptable, which will help researchers to collect data and expand the context of the study.”Corti now hopes that the ideas behind Sensewear’s smart clothing might one day find broader applications. “We would like to expand our philosophy to furniture, interior design and objects,” she says. “We think that everyone faces a certain degree of discomfort, so we are also thinking about people who just live in a hectic urban environment and might want protection from overwhelming sensations or stresses.”Imagine having a slow, firm hug, administered automatically and invisibly, on a delayed, crowded commuter train. There might well be a market for that.We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

This year sees the annual AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme return, with new categories including the Women Entrepreneurs in Health Tech award, created to encourage and support women pioneering some of the most innovative health technology.It’s certainly not that women aren’t enthused by the world of technology. We’ve spoken to three finalists, budding health tech entrepreneurs – who happen to also be women – to find out about their experiences within the industry.BrightSign develops communication tech for children and sign language users. Its founder, Hadeel Ayoub, travelled with a team to South Korea during her PhD studies to take part in a global hackathon, entering a smart glove that translates sign language into text or speech. They won the competition, which led her to develop the technology further and create BrightSign.“The tech arena in general is definitely male dominated. In digital health specifically, when I take part in trade shows or give a talk in a conference, most often I am the only woman on the programme. I am not necessarily treated differently, but the look of surprise on people’s faces when I am walking to the podium, into a meeting or presenting my technology cannot be overlooked. My name doesn’t always give me away as a woman, so it has happened to me several times that I am mistaken for the assistant while ‘Mr Hadeel’ is coming shortly.”Although Ayoub is encouraged by the progress the industry is making when it comes to being more inclusive to women, she sometimes feels she can be treated like a box to tick.“I feel I have been invited to events so they can even out the numbers and check the inclusivity and ersity boxes. That’s a shame, because I would rather be included for my work, not my gender.“I have to say that in the past couple of months, I have been very happy to see other female names presenting, and CEOs no less. There are a few women in tech in London. We have joined together and meet up regularly to share our challenges and support each other.”Hsin-Hua Yu, known as Sheana, was inspired by her own experiences with scoliosis (curvature of the spine) to create Aergo, a low-cost, inconspicuous postural support system. Sheana, who graduated with a double master’s in global innovation design at the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London, was motivated by a research visit where she met with young people who used wheelchairs but struggled to sit comfortably and maintain a healthy posture.“Students and carers complained about the social stigma caused by not being able to sit upright, which led to people excluding them from conversations or activities. This motivated me to create a solution that helps children to break free from the need for constant assistance and build their self-confidence,” she says.Despite her complex and life-changing work, Sheana feels she faces something of an uphill struggle to be taken seriously.“As a female founder, I feel I have more to prove in front of colleagues, investors and business partners. I find the medical industry is particularly male-dominated and this can sometimes be quite intimidating. I’ve learned that by being clear, firm and professional, people begin to look past my gender and see me for my abilities.”Sheana would like to see a more “inclusive” health tech industry in future.“I’d like to see health tech designing solutions for all members of society. A lot of health tech today focuses on the medical condition and not the person. This often leads to a solution that can contribute to prejudice and social stigma. I believe in creating tech that is accessible to a wider range of users because it has the power to transform lives, remove social barriers, and change perceptions of disability within our culture.” Before creating iBreve, Wahl was working at Google’s legal department in Dublin and Boston. While travelling with her co-creator in Rishikesh, India – known as the yoga capital of the world – the pair saw an opportunity to combine breathing techniques from eastern culture with the western world and its modern stresses.“The growing trend of mindfulness and the increasing popularity of wearables reinforced our endeavour,” says Wahl. “We decided to focus initially on women’s health and wellbeing. So we designed a beautiful and discreet wearable that attaches to the bra and helps to improve stress resilience by analysing breathing patterns with machine learning.”Wahl wants to inspire more women and more ersity as a whole in the tech world.“Inspiring more girls and women to join the tech world is going to contribute to this ersity and benefits society with better answers to the current big challenges we face. My time at Google and at iBreve showed me that working together with a erse team from different backgrounds and with different experiences is productive, insightful and fun.”She would encourage women wanting to break into the health tech industry – and the tech industry as a whole – to listen to their instincts and follow what comes naturally.“The most important thing is to believe in yourself and do what you are passionate about. Trust your instincts and share your ideas and passion with others.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream.

Up until then, I simply saw it as an allegorical tale for an austerity Britain ruled by a government not entirely favourable towards literature – writing the novel in a library felt like an act of defiance against the closure of 478 libraries between 2010 and 2017 – and particularly keen on squeezing the last gaps of life from some towns across the north of England. It now seems that history is what I have been writing about. Consequently, my wife and I find ourselves driving down the vast driveways of Bowhill House in the Scottish Borders in my trusted Fiat Panda across which passing people regularly write “Wash me”, where the shortlisted writers are to be guests of Richard Scott, 10th Duke of Buccleuch, descendent of Sir Walter Scott and organiser of the prize.The duke, who is the largest landowner in Scotland, offers to carry my suitcase. Within two minutes of arrival, any feelings about the British class system and aristocrats are quickly forgotten. One of the prize’s judges confides that this quiet, humble man is rather enamoured by writers and just as nervous about meeting us as we are him. I spend the next two days in a Noël Coward song, being fed potted shrimp and smoked salmon at two-hour intervals.As the ceremony approaches, there is something unspoken between us authors on the shortlist – Jane Harris (author of Sugar Money), Paul Lynch (Grace) and Rachel Malik (Miss Boston and Miss Hargreaves): we are all in this together, yet in competition, too. After all, who couldn’t use the £25,000 prize money? Last year, I earned £9,000 pre-tax (none of which came from book royalties) and my novel is published by Bluemoose Books, a husband and wife operation run largely on coffee and grand schemes (for my first novel with them we once stocked an entire shop with just my book). This prize is just as important to their survival as it is mine a win for Bluemoose would be like Liechtenstein winning the World Cup.After a panel discussion at the nearby Baillie Gifford Borders book festival in Melrose, we return the following night, like condemned men being led to the gibbet. Literary awards ceremonies are a little like being on psychedelic drugs: one’s emotions often run wild, veering into loathing, joy, paranoia, bliss, anxiety and mild hallucination. Did Rory Bremner really just approach me and do a William Hague impression for no discernible reason? Broadcaster James Naughtie keeps coming over and gently tapping me on the chin with a big meaty fist, the taps getting progressively harder as the “Scottish wine” (his words for whisky) flows. Gordon Brown is blocking the foot of the stairs every time I try to go to the toilet, which is often. (Shameless namedropping? That’s what my good friend Elton John said.) Everyone else seems to be having a better time than the writers.My parents are here, too. They pitched their caravan a few miles up the road three days earlier. Hearing this, the duke invites them to park it on one of his 280,000 acres, but my mother is a little embarrassed – though not so embarrassed to tell everyone she is my mother. As Kirsty Wark delivers heartfelt readings from each of our works, I’m distracted by a wasp that appears behind the writers, as if to torment us in the final silent seconds before the announcement.The Gallows Pole wins and I hear myself making a speech that, inexplicably, mentions both Guns N Roses and last year’s winner Sebastian Barry’s “beautiful doe eyes”. I’m off my head. Another part of the prize is that for the coming days the Royal Mail will officially stamp every piece of correspondence in Britain with the words: “Congratulations Benjamin Myers, winner of the Walter Scott Prize for historical fiction”. That will appear on 30m letters in total. Utterly absurd. Completely psychedelic.Back home, I bank the cheque and decide to celebrate my good fortune by doing what anyone unaccustomed to having money does: buying drinks for my friends in the local music venue. I go to the cashpoint. I have £12. • Benjamin Myers is the winner of the 2018 Walter Scott prize.

On Thursday, Green launched a high court bid to stop the Financial Reporting Council publishing its damning report on the failures of the auditors responsible for checking BHS’s accounts. The Topshop tycoon wants sections of the FRC analysis to be redacted or changed, arguing that references to him and other members of the former BHS management could cause “serious and potentially irreparable harm” to their reputations.Last week Steve Denison, the senior PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant who audited the BHS accounts ahead of its sale for £1, only a year before the department store chain collapsed, was given a 15-year ban and and record personal fine of £325,000 after he admitted misconduct. PwC was given a record £6.5m fine but the FRC’s report was not published at the same time.Andrew Green QC, the barrister acting for Taveta, the retail billionaire’s holding company, told the high court it was not seeking to block the publication of the report, which is primarily focused on PwC’s failings. Charles Béar, the barrister acting for the FRC, said it was not in the public interest to make any changes. “Publication of only part of the FRC’s reasons would be either unintelligible or misleading or both,” he said.The Commons work and pensions committee, which carried out an investigation into the demise of the department store in 2016, has already received a copy of the report. Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the committee and has regularly locked horns with Green over BHS, has been pushing for its publication. Field, who watched Thursday’s hearing, said outside the court that he would challenge any attempt by Green to modify the report. “This attempt at a gagging order is also gagging parliament,” he said. “At some stage we will have to come and argue there is a wider public interest than Sir Philip Green’s reputation.”Taveta is asking for an interim injunction before a judicial review. Mr Justice Nicklin said the hearing had raised “important issues that need to be properly considered” and he would pass judgment as soon as possible.On Thursday, a leaked email sent to nearly 1,000 PwC partners and written by the firm’s UK chairman, Kevin Ellis, was heavily critical of Denison who, it emerged, had backdated his BHS audit opinion and spent just two hours working on the file.In the email, Ellis described Denison’s supervision of the audit as “inadequate” with too much work delegated to a junior team member. “This situation should not have happened and we need to face up to the failings and learn the lessons,” he wrote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fd7dbe102f74a87a1ac11ea8d3778e82c157b4a/0_765_2349_1409/master/2349.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9297b10e34c063bc690e6b98eb8068b","title":"serene symmetry in the london underground in pictures","story":"Instagrammer Jess Macdonald captures quiet moments on the tube, showing another side to the capital’s transport systemFor most Londoners the tube is an unpleasant hotbed of stress to be avoided whenever possible, but Jess Macdonald captures a different side to the underground.

Spin that continues to sell this to us as a gracious concession, “allowing” us to stay “in the country where” we “are now living”. Forcing us to apply to stay in our own home, losing rights in the process and being charged £65 for the honour – that is, after all, the essence of settled status.There are some positive points to make. It is good to see it confirmed that the default position will be to grant settled status. We also know how much we will have to pay, with children getting in half-price, and that those who already hold permanent residence documentation or indefinite leave to remain will be exempt from the charge and will be able to swap that documentation for settled status. Likewise, I welcome the news that comprehensive sickness insurance will not be an obstacle for those already here. We also find some assurances for carers and other more vulnerable groups.Unfortunately, the clarity on some issues sits against a backdrop that is muddy and couched in vague language and timelines. In the end, the vast majority of our concerns, set out in the 150 unsettled questions by campaign group, the3million, remain unanswered.I am also left wondering about what kind of country the UK has already become. As Caroline Noke noted: “All applicants aged 10 or over will be checked against the UK’s national police database and watch lists.” Ten-year-old children! I suppose we should be grateful that nobody is suggesting putting them in cages.We still know little about the various application routes. Given that the app being developed will only work on Android phones, there is clearly much for the government to do in order to develop the easy and streamlined process it promised. However, there are more worrying issues than the type of phone you can apply on. We are to be issued with an ID number, which we will be required to use when going to see a doctor, for example, but potentially for other things, too, including property rental checks. If the ID number does not come in the form of a document, the potential for discrimination is high. Will a landlord really be prepared to take that extra step of checking us out if there is an alternative renter for whom this is not required?Questions like this abound and illustrate that our state of limbo will continue for a long time to come. For non-EU EEA citizens and those from Switzerland, that is even more so because there is only a reference for the desire to put in place a “similar deal” for them. But the main concern relates to the draft immigration rules. Described as “necessarily technical”, the plan is to implement settled status largely through secondary legislation. This type of legislation does not require the involvement of parliament, and so can be changed very easily. EU citizens, our lives forever reliant on the mood of future governments and the Home Office.Britons who live in EU countries also still face significant problems, and the home secretary’s comments, shifting the blame to the EU, are most unhelpful. As the British in Europe campaign group rightly points out: “It is the UK government that has thrown its own nationals in Europe into this uncertainty by insisting on introducing settled status for EU citizens in the UK.”As the second anniversary of the EU referendum looms, EU citizens in the UK and Britons who live in EU countries remain in limbo together. Nearly five million lives, five million futures, on hold and involuntarily parked in a layby, with all of us stuck on the back seat without access to the steering wheel of our own lives. This must end. Citizens’ rights must finally be agreed between the UK and EU as a matter of urgency. • Tanja Bueltmann is a professor in history at Northumbria University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a581e5c50bd3519302c1a2a6f6327810ffa123bd/0_73_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b6fb32bcb7884f81bddf2011bab3fa7","title":"the guardian view on mays brexit needs parliaments support","story":"The prime minister has once again seen off the Tory rebels. She now has to do the same to ‘hard Brexit’ cabinet colleaguesA couple of hours is a very long time in politics. Before 2.15pm on Wednesday, the former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve presented an amendment to give MPs the right to decide what happens if the Commons rejects the eventual Brexit deal. Mr Grieve had been leading a band of a dozen or so Tory rebels on the issue of a “meaningful vote”. With Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party bringing in sick MPs and convincing its Brexit-leaning parliamentarians to back the Tory rebel amendment, Theresa May’s government was heading for defeat. This would have been no bad thing. Mr Grieve’s laudable and correct aim was to stop the government leaving parliament with a dilemma later this year: take a deal, however unsatisfactory, or end up with no Brexit deal. Ninety minutes later, Mr Grieve, persuaded that parliamentary sovereignty could be observed in other ways, voted against his own amendment.What the former Conservative cabinet minister had wanted was a legally binding insurance policy, protecting the country against a foreseeable catastrophe. Instead, he accepted a risky gamble: that Tory rebels would be prepared to vote against a Brexit deal they did not like when the stakes would be much higher. One of the reasons Mr Grieve did so was because he said he could not ignore Mrs May’s entreaty to him that his actions could “undermine the government’s negotiating position in trying to get the United Kingdom the best possible deal for leaving the EU”. This overlooks the awkward fact that the irrationality of Mrs May’s Brexit enterprise means that there is a vanishingly small basis on which to form any calculable probability of anything it involves. However, rather late in the day it dawned on Mr Grieve that the “ultimate sanction” for a Brexit deal that parliament could not back was a motion of no confidence in the government.There is a spectrum of ways for parliament to hold the executive to account, most of which are shy of a legal commitment. Ministers operate within a system of constraint, overseen by MPs. Ultimately the government is answerable to the electorate for its actions. If Mrs May were to lose a Commons vote, even if it were a non-binding one, on a deal after 18 months of talks in\u0026nbspBrussels, it would break her authority as prime minister. She might choose to ignore such a vote and crash out of the EU or adopt her own “deal” regardless. But either way she would be taking the country on a perilous journey into the economic unknown without the full approval of parliament. Her days in No 10 would be numbered.Mrs May needs a deal that MPs can live with – one that does not endanger this country’s economy and wellbeing. To his credit, Labour’s Keir Starmer has argued this for more than a year. Mr Grieve was right to make the case that this logic should have legal teeth. But the quest for a truly meaningful vote proved beyond him. Mrs May concedes just enough to avoid Commons defeats. Yet the more cards she reveals, the tighter she presses the rest to her chest. This cannot go on much longer. The UK has a few months to publish its terms of withdrawal, yet no British solution to the Irish border challenge appears in sight. This will almost certainly require a high degree of regulatory alignment with the EU. Yet Brexiters encourage the delusion that they will happily crash out of the EU if Brussels does not offer a deal on their terms. Mrs May has called the bluff of loyalist backbench critics. It is time do so with her cabinet colleagues who want a hard Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2655dee1ddb9dcc4a31d914fb0313d190a815a9/0_116_4024_2415/master/4024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43af29972d212a5951958180afe0adc8","title":"turning down theresa may windrush reception caribbean hostile environment","story":"As a Caribbean migrant to the UK, I stand with those who have suffered in the ‘hostile environment’It was with both surprise and utter bemusement that I received Theresa May’s invitation to a reception on Friday afternoon at 10 Downing Street for the 70th\u0026nbspanniversary of Windrush.We in this country have become used to foreign heads of state and leaders of movements being made international pariahs and being refused entry to the UK. Robert Mugabe, Muammar Gaddafi, Louis Farrakhan, to name a few. In my book, the policies of May’s government – the denial of fundamental human rights for the Windrush generation, who devoted all of their adult years to the development of Britain – are enough to make her no less a pariah in the eyes of the Commonwealth and the freedom-loving world than those whom her government has sought to ostracise.In July 2013, as home secretary, May’s vans were running around London displaying billboards targeted at “illegal” immigrants, telling them to “go home or face arrest”. These vans misled not just the “illegal” immigrants whom it wished to flush out, but also the public, whom it wished to impress with its “zero tolerance” stance on illegal immigration: “106 arrests last week in your area”. It turns out that 106 was the total number of arrests across the six pilot boroughs in which the vans had operated over a period of two days. Arrests, not prosecutions or deportations.In an attempt to create a “hostile environment”, May placed four generations of Windrush arrivants and their descendants in the sight of any would-be defender of white Britain and its borders, including racists and neo-fascists, who felt they had a patriotic duty to help prevent Britain from being “swamped” by any means necessary.On 16 June 2016, Jo Cox MP was murdered in a street in her constituency of Batley \u0026amp Spen in West Yorkshire by white supremacist Thomas Mair. Cox was unequivocal in her support for refugees, asylum-seekers and economic migrants escaping armed conflict, genocide and hunger and risking their lives in rickety boats to cross the Mediterranean into Europe. She was doing this in a country where Ukip was focusing the two main parliamentary parties on the anger of the white British population at their failure to control immigration and reclaim Little England from the clutches of the European Union, with its Schengen agreement, free movement of labour and human rights protocols.Despite that horrific murder and all it said about Britain and its relentless conflation of immigration and race, the British electorate voted to leave the European Union. What is worse is that, both as home secretary and prime minister, May redoubled her efforts to create this hostile environment for immigrants, condemning long-retired workers of the Windrush generation to uncertainty, misery, physical hardship and denial of the same life-saving health services for which they have paid throughout their working lives.It may well be that May will have the good grace to take the opportunity to tell her invited guests (suggested dress code: “smart attire”) how sorry she is for her part in the brutal, inhumane and racist treatment of former colonised Africans who have and had no interest other than to serve this nation, and do their best by their communities and families. But one of the uglier manifestations of whiteness in this society is an unassailable sense of in-your-face entitlement.I do not believe that the prime minister is entitled to the magnanimity of those misguided folk who might well be happy to attend her Windrush anniversary celebration. As far as I am concerned, I stand with those who suffered detention, deportation and mental ill-health, some of whom even now face an earlier death as a result of being denied access to health services on account of the hostile environment policy.It would be a shameful betrayal to them all to accept the invitation to Downing Street. Instead, the prime minister can invite me again when she meets with civil society to discuss the findings and recommendations of the Royal Commission on Reparations for African Enslavement, which May will no doubt implement immediately off the back of her government’s Windrush scandal.• Gus John is an academic and an equality and human rights campaigner"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab6227726db93fdbf8b0d0ef5226e957d5f03b32/0_131_3452_2071/master/3452.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a96aca6a0ad95ee710d521d66817bcd","title":"saving britains swifts in pictures","story":"Swifts are one of the most recognisable birds of summer, returning to the UK to breed in early May each year.

It started with “accessomorphosis”, which he said was as a portmanteau describing the transformation of an accessory into a garment. This formed the basis of the 56-look collection he called Colour Theory. A double-breasted wool-mohair blazer fused with a white leather bib, complete with a pencil-case pouch a leather vest, embossed with the fashion house’s signature monogram, had protruding structured pockets and anoraks were cut away at the back to make way for an attached bum bag.Louis Vuitton is, of course, famed for accessories. Abloh took signature bag silhouettes such as the large Keepall, the Runner and the Petit-Malle (a miniature version of the transatlantic trunks with which the house made its name in the 1800s) and reimagined them – some in red, green and iridescent plastic, others in matte leather with the traditional hardware detailing. Hanging off each were multicoloured ceramic chains, which also were used as bracelets and necklaces, while creeper ankle boots and vintage suede sneakers completed the look. Reimagining is what Abloh is all about. The American designer’s appointment as Louis Vuitton’s artistic director in March was the culmination of his rise over the past three years and makes him the first designer of colour to hold such a high-profile position. What makes his new role the most interesting is his unorthodox trajectory. The 37-year-old didn’t go to fashion school instead his formal qualifications lie in engineering and architecture and he has had a successful career as a DJ and producer for the past two decades. What could be his achilles heel, however, is his greatest asset. The way he has challenged the preconceived notions of what a fashion designer looks like at his five-year-old label Off-White, is exactly the fresh perspective that has captured the millennial zeitgeist and ultimately had Louis Vuitton knocking on his door.When news broke of the hire, Louis Vuitton’s chief executive, Michael Burke, praised Abloh’s “innate creativity and disruptive approach”. On Thursday in Paris, Abloh explained to guests that he would not describe himself as a designer or an image maker, but that he wanted to “define the title of artistic director for a new and different era”. A reminder that he has never attested to be anything he is not. What he is, however, is focused on ersity and inclusivity. In his dictionary, F was for “fandom: two-way worship between a designer and his clientele”. In the lead-up to his debut collection, he shared snapshots of his inspiration with his 2.3 million followers on Instagram and, at the show, the spray-painted rainbow catwalk (matching the palette of the collection) was lined by students he had invited from Paris. The model line-up, meanwhile, had representatives from every continent in the world – bar Antarctica – that were shown on a map that read “We are the world”.At his own Off-White show on Wednesday, the father-of-two explained that he saw his brand as the teenager to Vuitton’s adult. While there was plenty of tailoring to please that clientele, there was equal measure of teen spirit. Tie-dye jacquard smocks, hooded anoraks and oversized shirts took on a Wizard of Oz theme, with the face of Judy Garland’s Dorothy depicted in sequins and surrounded by poppies.His Louis Vuitton collection elicited a standing ovation from the audience, among whom was Abloh’s mentor, Kanye West, who hugged the emotional designer as he bowed and admitted to the audience that he was very proud. Backstage were Abloh’s parents, Eunice and Nee, waiting patiently to congratulate their son. This was their first time in Paris to witness his work and both said it had been an emotional two days. His mother said she had two words of advice for her son before the show: be cool. Abloh succeeds Kim Jones, who makes his debut at Dior Homme on Saturday, in the role. The baton has been passed amicably between the two, with Abloh seen as a complementary successor, given their talents at creating cult products and the hype that goes with them. Abloh has also created sell-out collaborations, including the Off-White x Nike Air Jordan 1 Chicago trainer, for which resale prices exceeded $2,000 (£1,500). It looks set to continue, as in Virgil’s vocabulary C is for collaboration. Abloh, meanwhile, remains humble. He has previously said he “just wants to live up to the greats of fashion”, but is clearly intent on redefining a new era in the process. “Tides change when positions evolve,” Abloh mused earlier this year. In that dictionary, Z stood for: “If you’ve made it this far, thank you for your time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a3f9655fe7c4be49daf02192d10ff6ab1d79093/0_0_2600_1561/master/2600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=926c3596aef09e0903535ff0667ab93e","title":"get short y the best shorts in pictures","story":"Here comes the sun – and with it an excuse to put your trousers and tights in the wardrobe.

It ran every four years from 1952-60, with emerging teams from North America joining the big hitters from the South. And though the competition is unlikely to be a Mastermind specialist subject any time soon, it had its moments. In 1952 Uruguay and Brazil met for the first time since the immortal Maracanazo of 1950, when Alcides Ghiggia’s late goal stole the World Cup from the host, Brazil. A virile rematch ended 4-2 to Brazil in goals and 1-1 on sendings off.Eight years later Brazil were the subject of one of international football’s more incongruous scorelines when they lost 3-0 to the host, Costa Rica. The result stood out then it stands out even more now. Costa Rica’s record against Brazil going into Friday’s match in St Petersburg is dismal: P10 W1 L9. That includes two World Cup defeats, 1-0 in a low-key game at Italia 90 and 5-2 in a wildly open match 12 years later, and assorted pastings elsewhere.Brazil were the world champions when they lost to Costa Rica – they won the tournament for the first time in 1958 and would retain it in 1962. But it was not David v Goliath so much as David v Goliath’s clumsier younger sibling.The Brazil team were unrecognisable from the one that won those World Cups. The Panamerican Championship was scheduled at the same time as the prestigious Rio-São Paulo Tournament, which back then was the closest Brazil had to a national championship, so Pelé, Garrincha and the rest took part in that instead.Brazil picked a team entirely of Gaúchos – the name given to those who played in Rio Grande do Sul, the southern state known for its cowboys. Brazil’s captain, Énio Rodrigues, had five caps going into the Costa Rica match, their second of the tournament. The rest of the team had eight between them.It’s a truism that there is no such thing as a bad Brazil team, and the squad for the competition was still full of fine players. Most of them came from Grêmio, who were in the middle of a run of 12 state championships in 13 years the rest were from Internacional, Cruzeiro and Aimoré.When they played Costa Rica in San José, they were caught cold by early goals from Guillermo “Memo” Valenciano and Édgar Quesada. An affronted Brazil bombarded the Costa Rica goal thereafter but the goalkeeper Hernán Alvarado produced the kind of performance that is still being talked about in a foreign newspaper 58 years later. Rigoberto Rojas’s late goal added an extra sheen of disbelief but a crowd of 25,000 happily gawped at the evidence on the primitive electronic scoreboard, sitting right below a huge Esso slogan: Costa Rica 3-0 Brasil.After the match there was giddy talk that Costa Rica might win the tournament. With all four teams – Argentina and Mexico were the others – playing each other twice, Brazil had the chance for revenge a week later. The element of surprise, and perhaps complacency, was gone. Costa Rica lost 4-0.The Brazil game was Costa Rica’s only win out of six in the tournament. It was the biggest result in their history until 1990, when they beat Scotland in their first ever World Cup match.As with England’s famous win at the Maracanã in 1984, few Costa Ricans felt the need to kill their own joy by highlighting the fact that most of Brazil’s best players were missing. A win over Brazil is a win over Brazil is a win over Brazil.Besides, Costa Rica had more than enough reason to think they could hold their own in more elite company. A couple of months before that match, they drew 2-2 with a full-strength Botafogo – the same “Esquadrão Imortal” who are indelibly associated with Brazil’s first two World Cup wins. The team included Garrincha, the greatest winger of all time Nílton Santos, Brazil’s best ever left-back the futuristic left-winger Mário Zagallo and the goal machine Quarentinha.Costa Rica’s draw was arguably a worthier result, though it is not the one people remember. You never forget the first time you beat Brazil – especially when it’s the only time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8dd406752c2fd56b18ec8e4eb529a60bc70e88e/0_131_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cda1355dcb6e16062b47d288813e2ccc","title":"denmark australia world cup group c match report","story":"Samara is the sixth largest city in Russia and the centre of the country’s space exploration industry. It remains a secretive place, a hangover from when the Soviet Union battled the United States at the cutting edge of technology to send the first human into outer space. It was here that the rocket was built in which Yuri Gagarin completed an orbit of Earth.But on Thursday, inside a stadium designed in tribute to Samara’s history, football’s newest frontier of technology took centre stage. Video assistant refereeing should not be rocket science, basically equating to the opportunity for replays of incidents to allow a more considered decision to be taken by the referee. But it continues to confuse and confound, with both Australia’s and Denmark’s managers pointing out its shortcomings.On this occasion the VAR decision went in Australia’s favour and Mile Jedinak converted a penalty to keep alive the Socceroos’ narrow hopes of advancing to the knockout stage of the World Cup. That goal cancelled out Christian Eriksen’s magical seventh-minute opener but Australia could not capitalise on their second-half dominance. Their progress depends on them beating Peru and the result of the other Group C game going their way.With uncertainty hanging in the air, talk turned to VAR. Australia were the wrong side of history in their opening game against France when a penalty was awarded for the first time in a World Cup match since VAR was introduced. On that occasion, Josh Risdon was judged upon review to have fouled Antoine Griezmann, much to the outrage of the Australian players. They may have felt they were due a lenient VAR decision and 38 minutes into this game, trailing by a goal, they got one.The athletic Mathew Leckie rose prominently on the penalty spot with Yussuf Poulsen barging in with a late challenge. The Dane did not have much time to address his flailing limbs and Leckie’s header struck his left forearm. The Spanish referee, Antonio Mateu Lahoz, briefly left the field to consult the VAR monitor and decided to award a penalty.Denmark’s coach, Åge Hareide, bemoaned perceived inconsistencies. “I do believe there was a penalty,” he said, “but the whole issue with VAR is that there are people somewhere in Russia to look at decisions because it looks like it could maybe have been a penalty. But other situations they are not having a look at. So who is deciding? The referee on the pitch or people in dark rooms elsewhere in Russia? In my opinion it removes a bit of the charm of football.”Jedinak stepped up to the spot and remained composed in the face of sledging by Kasper Schmeichel. The heavily bearded Crystal Palace midfielder fired low and hard to the goalkeeper’s left, bringing an end to Schmeichel’s record run of nine hours and 31 minutes without conceding at international level. It also means that Australia’s last five goals in competitive games have come from Jedinak penalties.That lack of goalscorers was clear in the second half. Australia failed to steal victory despite creating chances through Leckie and 19-year-old hotshotDaniel Arzani, the youngest player in the tournament, who sparkled after coming on with 22 minutes to play.There were suggestions that Arzani should start the final game but the Australia coach, Bert van Marwijk, was unmoved. “I will not be telling you my plans,” he bristled.The opening goal originated from a fine reverse pass by Nicolai Jørgensen after an electric start by the Danes. The Feyenoord forward flicked the ball behind him and into the path of the bounding Eriksen inside the 18-yard box. The Tottenham playmaker showed his class by getting over the ball and burying a left-footed half volley beyond the stretching Matty Ryan.The Danes, on and off the pitch, called for a penalty in the 50th minute as Poulsen went down in the box, muscled off the ball by a couple of dark green Australian shirts.

Kylian Mbappé bounded off after scoring the winner in an absorbing game, his first on this stage, a tap-in that was impossible to miss. Then he suddenly stopped and shrugged, as if to say: “What is the fuss all about?” Life moves pretty fast for Mbappé. The whirlwind forward, already the most expensively valued teenager in football, became France’s youngest goalscorer at a major tournament and took it all in that easy stretch of a stride.He broke a record that had stood since the World Cup in 1998 (just a few months before he was born) when David Trezeguet scored against Saudi Arabia. In a moment of sweet symmetry, a grey-suited Trezeguet just happened to be watching on from the stands in Ekaterinburg, a guest of honour for this match.It was riveting, its tightly bound emotions propelling both teams to give everything to reach their stated goal. France found a mix of enough style and substance to seal qualification. Unfortunately for Peru, their was no reward for their positive display. A second defeat ends their hopes of reaching the next round, even if the adventure off the pitch with their army of fervent supporters will go on for the next game at least.At times this felt like the Lima of the Urals, with Peru’s bouncing red and white masses crammed into the seats that had lain empty for Egypt against Uruguay. France needed sangfroid. They needed to master the atmosphere as well as the technical questions of the game all at once.The inclusion of Olivier Giroud, designed to give the team more balance, and to allow others around him to have more freedom to do damage, made an instant impression. Giroud bustled up front, fighting for possession and looking every inch the big man towering over Peru’s defenders. He gave France a target which was perfect for Antoine Griezmann and Mbappé to buzz around – exactly the plan. They put Peru under pressure with a series of chances which all originated from Giroud’s knockdowns and buildup play.“He is our best scorer and he has very specific qualities,” noted Didier Deschamps. “The way he holds the ball up, he was very good and all the players around him linked up very well. As I have said, it’s often that when he is not on the team we appreciate how useful he is.” He was more than useful in engineering a more positive gameplan. It looks like the new way forward for France during this tournament has been cemented.The influential Paul Pogba, whose dominance alongside the work of N’Golo Kanté was another vital part of the new strategy. In the 34th minute Pogba won the ball from Paolo Guerrero in the centre of midfield and played a clever pass for Giroud. The striker’s effort took a looping ricochet off Alberto Rodríguez and the ball spun away, almost in slow motion. Peru’s stranded goalkeeper could only helplessly watch the trajectory as Mbappé arrived to tap into the empty net.“I was very happy,” Mbappé said. “I have always said the World Cup was a dream for any player. I hope to have more moments like this.” When France were at their most fluid Mbappé and Griezmann were able to fire up the afterburners. Mbappé even began to showboat, with a flick here and there, enjoying the opportunity to express himself.Peru had only one clear sight of goal in the first half, Guerrero shooting straight at Hugo Lloris, who was not overly troubled as he won his 100th cap. So Ricardo Gareca bolstered his attack at the break and Peru went for it with heart. France showed discipline to withstand the pressure, defending diligently, and restricting Peru to long shots. The best of them came from Pedro Aquino, who struck with glorious power and swerve only to see his effort crack against the post. The crowd did their utmost to will one of these opportunities in as the emotion swirled around the stadium. But it was not to be.It left Gareca lamenting that they could not offer more tangible reward to the huge number of travelling fans, with an estimated 25,000 making all the noise in Ekaterinburg. “If there is anything that hurts, it is that the fans were so enthusiastic,” he said. “We are pained we have been eliminated and can’t play the last match with any hope of going on. But we gave it our all. We will do everything to try to win the last game so they can at least celebrate one victory at this World Cup.”He is, though, hopeful for a brighter future for Peruvian football. “Now people realise Peru has huge potential. Our intention was to come here and compete at this level and see where we stand. Over time this is going to make us stronger.”France, too, have their own more immediate focus on growing stronger as they progress."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b276b0428557d07a99a21f246e2d51c2996a6a5/0_173_5196_3118/master/5196.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c507bf776bb0722be394a41e81bd57c","title":"iceland bullish mood shed underdog status nigeria","story":"Heimir Hallgrímsson wasted little time with the first question, dollied up as usual by Fifa’s local media attaché, of his press conference previewing the challenge posed by Nigeria. What did the Iceland manager expect to happen on Friday afternoon? “We expect to win,” he said before turning to his captain, Aron Einar Gunnarsson. “What do you think?”A slightly more equivocal opinion followed from Gunnarsson, who has clearly put a decade spent in England to good use. It would be a tough test, but Iceland were ready for it. There was nothing new about that, or Hallgrímsson’s characteristic confidence, but in one important regard their dynamic has shifted over the past six days, ever since that courageously executed draw with Argentina in Moscow. Iceland will now go into a major tournament fixture as favourites and, lovable as they remain, the image of knockabout underdogs bears no resemblance to their attitude on the pitch. It brings a new set of pressures, though, and if those needed relieving then one of the questions that arose from the Icelandic press corps almost seemed purpose-built for the job.Coach and skipper both dissolved into mirth and, certainly in Gunnarsson’s case, blushes when they were asked whether the squad is banned from having sex during the tournament. The players were allowed to meet with their families on Thursdayand the intention, presumably, was to gain a degree of insight into their likely pre-match exertions.“For the time being, yes,” Gunnarsson said. “At least as long as the wives have not arrived,” explained Hallgrímsson, cutting in quickly. “No, sex is not banned, it’s bullshit.”Hallgrímsson probably feels his players have earned his trust in that department and most others. Negotiating the hurdle of Argentina so expertly, even if the headline was Hannes Thór Halldórsson’s penalty save from Lionel Messi, gave them a start they would have settled for. Nigeria had been billed in some quarters as a surprise package before the tournament but a listless display against Croatia dulled some of that optimism and Gernot Rohr’s side will need to be far sharper if they are to overcome such a superbly-drilled unit that is more inventive, too, than its Euro 2016 iteration. Iceland hold the upper hand even if the margins remain tight, but it was instructive to hear Hallgrímsson zero in on some of the values he holds dear when asked to describe Nigeria’s strengths. “Physically strong, quick, good athletes with big running capacity,” he said. “They are a direct, really good counterattacking side. If you watch their games in the last year you can see their improvement in tactical awareness and in my opinion they have many things that make a good football team.”He could have been describing his own side although one of the players who adds creative spark to the graft will almost certainly be absent on Friday. Jóhann Berg Gudmundsson, a good shout for any Premier League XI of most improved players after a superb 2017-18 season at Burnley, is unlikely to recover from a knock sustained in the Argentina game but Hallgrímsson – who has become used to battling injury concerns during his two years in sole charge – said his absence would “not change the plans we have decided before this game”.Would that Nigeria could operate with such assuredness. Rohr has, predictably, been under pressure to make changes after they struggled to create chances of note against a relatively nondescript Croatia. There is a possibility he will switch to a back three and there are also questions about the position of the captain Mikel John Obi, who made no impact at No 10. “If I have to sacrifice a position, go play wherever, I will do that for this team to win games,” Mikel said, possibly paving the way for Rohr to reshuffle his front line.Rohr himself sounded a similarly optimistic note to his opposite number. “We will not lose this game,” he promised, before bringing up his team’s “little advantage with the temperature”. It is likely to be around 32 degrees when the match kicks off Nigeria sense an achilles heel although Iceland, whose training camp is in the Black Sea resort of Gelendzhik, have spent considerable time accustoming themselves to such conditions.Nigeria must raise their own tempo, either way, and hope to find an Iceland side caught between poles. Defeat will mean what he already describes as a “team for 2022” has to set its sights four years ahead and that is unlikely to satisfy anyone back in a west African country whose potential, and sheer volume of footballers, should bring far better results.Whoever ends up matching expectation with achievement in Volgograd, a healthy degree of perspective will remain. On Monday Iceland’s squad posed with a national goalkeeping jersey bearing the name of Carl Ikeme, the Nigeria and Wolves keeper who is receiving treatment for acute leukaemia. Ikeme is a former team-mate of the Iceland forward Jón Dadi Bödvarsson and they also tweeted their support to a player Rohr regards as his “24th man”. Iceland will remain grounded in victory or defeat, but the former could open up new storylines in a tale whose pitch-perfect tone has never wavered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a98c256bc2322a64b0ef3a4827142e6d92930a6/0_17_4626_2775/master/4626.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acf64ddd7569dff32e606344a597a01e","title":"rashford sterling southgate meritocracy england world cup panama","story":"At least the signals are that Gareth Southgate’s national setup is run as a meritocracy. Raheem Sterling had spent the buildup to this tournament as England’s match-winner elect, one of a handful of players in an inexperienced squad who had tasted life at a World Cup and a Premier League title winner who had dazzled with Manchester City. The sense was these were to be his finals. They may still be yet.But in a group where everyone is hungry to impress, every quiet performance jeopardises the next involvement. Sterling had shown flashes of his quality in the friendly win over Nigeria at Wembley but Marcus Rashford had scored a memorable goal from distance and tormented his opposing full-backs on the flanks when granted his own run-out against Costa Rica in Leeds. Even on Monday against Tunisia Sterling’s partnership with Harry Kane had rarely fired and, confidence perhaps rocked by a miss at the far post, his display rather petered out. The man who replaced him could run at tiring legs and did so with relish. Rashford has earned his chance from the start.Maybe Sterling can have a similar impact if flung on late in Nizhny Novgorod. At present, he needs some luck in front of goal to reignite his career in the national team and remind the world of his qualities. It has been so long – 21 matches stretching back to October 2015 – since he last scored for his country, and his two international goals from 39 caps have come in home games against the dubious might of Lithuania and Estonia. There is simply no real weight of form behind him at present to make him untouchable.So many of his 23 goals for Manchester City last term had been the culmination of incisive, intricate moves which had left opponents gasping as they attempted to keep up, and were scored by a player darting in from the flank. He was as slippery as any of the forward-thinking talents, and he invariably went untracked while darting in for his tap-in. But England, for all their upturn in panache and possession under Southgate, will not create as many opportunities as the Premier League champions. They need to take what they create.In truth, Sterling has never looked entirely comfortable in national colours as a No\u0026nbsp10. At present, they need someone more ruthless alongside the captain. Rashford has hardly been prolific for his country as yet, but he has started only eight of his 20 caps. The rest have been cameos, and that display against Costa Rica – fellow Central Americans – suggested he can hit the ground running on his first World Cup start. His instincts are those of a central striker.As for Sterling, the temptation is to think this is the time for Pippa Grange, a psychologist and the head of people and team development at the Football Association, who is with the team in Russia, to earn her money. The same player had been substituted at half-time in the second game at Euro 2016, with England losing 1-0 to Wales at the time, and there would inevitably be concerns his confidence could be damaged by leaving him out.Yet the 23-year-old is tough. He has been through far worse than this, not least in the buildup to this tournament whether it was time-keeping or a tattoo that drew him into focus, and will believe he can swiftly recover his place in the starting lineup and showcase his talent.Sooner rather than later, Sterling will be back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/350b09667eb4e6c769636e6be74adbbe1b4fc0a4/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=800fff313441e19dcf34bde6f90a2d4b","title":"ronaldo neymar winners losers world cup","story":"Russia have been the surprise of the tournament so far and many are still sceptical as to how. If you put the phenomenal running stats to one side (Russia have covered more ground per match than any other team in the tournament) one good reason is the form of Denis Cheryshev, who has spent the majority of his life in Spain and plays for Villarreal. The winger has offered strength and flair from the left side but most importantly has shown calm and confidence under pressure. His three goals have come at crucial moments and he looks comfortable on this stage.Not so much comfortable on the stage as believing he owns it, Ronaldo has made sure the spotlight is always on him in Group B. The hat-trick against Spain may not have been the best of the 51 he has scored but in terms of generating headlines it was spot on his 88th-minute free kick truly kickstarted the World Cup. A poacher’s header subsequently took care of a progressive Morocco side, putting Portugal on the verge of the last 16 and Ronaldo at the front of the chase for the Golden Boot. What would the limelight do without him?On the other end of the attention-seeking spectrum, England’s manager has been making headlines this past week. First he was profiled in the American magazine the New Yorker, described as being a one-man antidote to England’s footballing malaise with his “radical sensibleness”. This quality appeared to have transmitted itself to his team as England astonishingly stuck to a game plan in securing a late win over Tunisia. Southgate, and the Football Association, are doing things differently this year and, currently, it’s working. That’s good news for everyone, including the country. Just a shame about that dislocated shoulder.Senegal’s 2-0 win over Poland stands them in good stead to qualify from Group H. Both goals had an element of fluke about them but the Teranga Lions earned their luck. Theirs was a victory built on defensive discipline and intelligent use of space qualities that don’t fit the lazy stereotypes of African football. Cissé claimed the victory, the only one for any African side so far, on behalf of the entire continent. The only black manager at the tournament also took the opportunity to speak up for African coaching. “You see lots of African players in European clubs,” he said. “Now we need African coaches for our continent to go ahead.” Cissé, whose touchline moves have also entertained, is doing his bit for the cause.Of all the players listed as potential new World Cup stars, few have shown up so far. Morocco’s Hakim Ziyech played well in a defeat by Portugal, Rodrigo Bentancur has had one good half for Uruguay. Only Mexico’s Lozano has really made people sit up and pay attention. The goalscorer in El Tri’s upset win over Germany, Lozano seized his moment, calmly getting off a shot just before Toni Kroos could shut him down. But he was a menace to Germany throughout thanks to his pace, directness and ability to act out Juan Carlos Osorio’s smart tactical plan. Now the PSV Eindhoven forward has to do it again against South Korea.Football has a complacent attitude towards concussion and it was embodied in the actions of Morocco towards one of their own players, Nordin Amrabat. Injured in a clash of heads with Iran’s midfielder Ehsan Hajsafi during their opening game, Amrabat was floored and withdrawn from the game, albeit after being slapped around the face by the coaching staff. He spent the night in hospital and has admitted to having lost his memory for six hours. Fifa’s official guidance is that a concussed player should not take the field again for a minimum of six days. Morocco suggested they would follow this protocol only to select Amrabat against Portugal, five days later. Manager Hervé Renard called Amrabat “a warrior”. The players’ union Fifpro described Renard’s decision to select him as “alarming”.It might be described as an unwritten rule: don’t deliberately handle the ball in the box three minutes into a match. Don’t deliberately handle it at any point, some might say, but certainly when the game is in its opening moments and you will almost certainly incur a red card. Yet that was what the 32-year-old Sánchez did against Japan, putting Colombia at a considerable disadvantage. He was sent off and conceded a penalty, which the Asian side duly scored. Colombia played well with 10 men and drew level but they were overwhelmed in the end and find themselves in a precarious place in the tournament.Tactically, Mexico did a number on Germany but they also exploited weaknesses in the world champions. Some of these were structural, such as Joshua Kimmich playing in spaces more familiar to a No 10 than a full-back, but some were down to personnel. Khedira has 15 major honours in his career, including titles in the past three Serie A seasons. But the 31-year-old could not compete with the athleticism of Mexico’s midfield. He was ineffective in possession too and all too easily bypassed when out of it. As Germany clambered to get back into the game he was withdrawn with 20 minutes to go.He scored, a consolation penalty thumped into the roof of the Russia net on Tuesday, so the Egyptian King has a World Cup goal to his name. But that is the only consolation in what has been the biggest anticlimax of the tournament. After dislocating a shoulder during an Act of Ramos in the Champions League final, Salah was not judged fit enough to play in Egypt’s opening defeat by Uruguay. Starting against Russia, this bright flame of a player was reduced to a flicker. He wasn’t helped by his position, stationed wide right and away from the action, but each time the ball came to his feet exasperation was not far behind. No player was the subject of greater expectation before this World Cup those hopes have not been met.Another superstar carrying the weight of the nation on his shoulders, another pre-tournament injury, a whole host of question marks. Against Switzerland Neymar draw the ball towards him like a magnet. He also drew the physical attention of his opponents, which may have had something to do with it. But while Brazil’s play was unfailing channelled through the Paris St-Germain superstar, his end product flattered to deceive. He was dispossessed seven times in a match from which Switzerland scraped an unexpected point. Since then he has not trained fully for the Seleção, citing pain in an ankle. There are questions to be answered against Costa Rica on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a70b78caa94ec9a6aa04127194f86d04a4626a3c/0_177_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f10bf587b8a9f151d830ebcec0600c28","title":"argentina v croatia world cup 2018 live","story":"76 min: Rakitic goes down in the centre circle, winded. The referee stops the play with Argentina on the attack. Argentina are rightly annoyed, and surround the ref, but it’s done now.74 min: Messi has a moan at the referee, waving his arms about in frustration over very little. He’s on a rolling boil right now.73 min: Mandzukic brushes past Mascherano down the right and romps goalwards. He crosses into the centre. Otamendi and Mercado confuse each other, and the ball deflects to Kramaric, who is closed down by Cabellero to the left of goal. He’s got options in the middle, but opts to beat Cabellero himself. And doesn’t. A waste.71 min: Dybala cuts in from the right and looks to curl one into the top left. It’s a wild effort, but at least it’s something.70 min: Modric stumbles through a few challenges in the middle, keeps his balance in astonishing fashion, and flicks Kramaric free down the left. That was sensational play. Kramaric reaches the byline and comes very close to finding Mandzukic in the centre with a pullback. Not quite. Modric is such a wonderful player to watch. A glorious mix of steely determination and pretty skill.68 min: The last roll of the dice for Argentina: Dybala comes on in place of Perez.67 min: Vrsaljko is booked for a late slide on Acuna.66 min: Croatia nearly extend their lead. Rakitic scoops a pass wide right for Vrsaljko, who slips a ball inside for Mandzukic, on the corner of the six-yard area. It’s a lovely slick move. Caballero isn’t an imposing figure here, and there’s space at the near post. Mandzukic tries to flick home, but only flaps the ball into the side netting.64 min: From the set piece, Otamendi sends a header over the bar. Argentina have stepped it up since going behind.63 min: Higuain is sent bombing towards the byline on the left by Perez. He pulls it back for Meza, who surely must score from six yards! He sidefoots towards the bottom left. Subasic palms the ball out, though he tried his best to palm it into the net. Rakitic slides in to poke the ball out for a corner.61 min: Messi picks up the pace with a speed dribble, his first serious contribution of the evening. He nearly sets Higuain free down the right, but the move peters out. Much better, though, from both Messi and Argentina. “Give Zafar Sobhan a cigar,” writes Sam Hankins. “He called it exactly!” Yep. You’ve gotta love our readership.59 min: Mandzukic is booked for a late lunge on Meza. In the stand, Diego Maradona chomps on his nails.57 min: The entire stadium seems shocked at the nature of that howler. Shades of the atmosphere at the Champions League final after Loris Karius’s error. They replace Salvio with Pavon. Croatia meanwhile swap the injured goalscorer Rebic with Kramaric.55 min: Argentina respond by taking off Aguero and sending Higuain on. Perisic goes at Argentina down the right, winning a corner, but the set piece comes to nothing.What an absurd error by Willy Caballero! Dealing with a simple backpass, he tries to chip a pass wide right to Mercado. But he doesn’t get enough on it, simply teeing it up in mid-air for Rebic, who meets it first time with a screaming volley into the top right! Oh Willy!53 min: Messi drifts in from the right and feeds Tagliafico, who slips a pass down the inside left for Aguero. A shot from a tight angle, but it’s easily gathered by Subasic. Then Croatia go straight up the other end and ...51 min: Modric sweeps a pass out left for Rebic, who tears down the wing in great style, sashaying past a couple of challenges. Then he’s taken out by Mercado, who sticks a leg across his knees. Hilariously old-school. He’s booked, and doesn’t bother complaining.50 min: Vrsaljko and Acuna squabble on the touchline over a throw. Perisic romps down the right but his cross is easily dealt with. This is scrappy right now.49 min: Hesitation from Lovren, followed by confusion between Brozovic and Vida. Croatia do not convince at the back. Aguero nearly takes advantage, but the ball clanks out of play. Another phase, and Acuna has a whack from distance, but Lovren blocks well this time. “Messi to me is blameless as he is forced by vice and not virtue of this humdrum Argentine XI to not just be himself, he has to be Iniesta as well,” opines Hubert O’Hearn. “His career cannot be judged on a World Cup. Football is a team sport. One that frames its greatest players, but a frame made of shirt cardboard is not gilt gold.”47 min: Both teams take turns to have a little feel of the ball, re-familiarising themselves with it. A slow start to the second half, in other words. Here’s Zafar Sobhan: “This game will be decided by a grotesque defensive error. Only thing that remains to be seen is by whom. Not the boldest of predictions I know, sorry.”And we’re off again! No half-time changes by either team. Argentina get the party restarted. They’ll be hoping to bring it up a notch or two. Messi only touched the ball 20 times in that first half Aguero just seven. “It seems telling that Croatia’s key player, Modric, is a passing play maker, whereas Argentina’s key player, Messi, is more of a dribbler,” begins David Wall. “So when Modric plays well it means Croatia play well. But when Messi plays well it means that Messi plays well. That may in itself decide a game, but it doesn’t really make the team as a whole convince. Perhaps the manager should just tell him to get over the idea of trying to win it himself, and instead base their play on the abilities of all eleven, with Messi as an exceptional component of that.”Half-time reading: The action from earlier, in case you’re just in from work, or whatever it is they say on the telly ...It’s goalless, but very intriguing. Both teams should have scored both teams could easily have had a man sent off. Messi has done nothing. The second half promises to be quite the event.45 min +2: Modric sends Rebic clear down the left with a glorious diagonal pass. But Rebic lets the ball get stuck under his feet. He’s forced to check back, then attempt a curler into the top right, which he gets all wrong.45 min: There will be two added minutes. This half has flown by.44 min: Tackles continue to fly in. Meza stands on Vrsaljko’s ankle. That’s a really bad one as well. Again, VAR checks it and decides there’s no need to escalate things.42 min: Brozovic, out on the right, crosses long for Rebic, who can’t quite get the ball under control immediately. He tangles again with Salvio, who stumbles. Suddenly Rebic has space on the left flank, but the referee blows for a generous free kick. Argentina got away with that one.40 min: Rebic is booked for planting his studs on Salvio’s shin. It was a nasty one, it should have been a red card. Though it’s been checked by the VAR, and it’s not considered a clear and obvious error.38 min: Tagliafico makes good down the left, but sends a harmless looping cross into the arms of Subasic. To be fair, he hardly had a man to aim for in the Croatian box. Argentina strangely non-committal.36 min: Mercado is down getting some treatment, after being winded in an aerial 50-50 duel with Rebic. He took a knee in the chest, though it looked accidental, both players going for the ball in the no-nonsense style.34 min: Salvio nips past Strinic and gets an arm in the mush for his trouble. The Croatian defender is slightly lucky to get away without a booking, but this referee is good-humoured and lenient. And to be fair, we’ve hardly noticed him. Speaking of which ... “There’s nothing wrong with Messi’s involvement in this game that the immediate Argentinian recruitment of the other 10 Barcelona first team wouldn’t fix,” writes Charles Antaki, who may or may not be trying to start an argument just for the sheer hell of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9ac884f641dd6819f8eb4b8211cf8bb81eae580/0_268_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db973d2b087197dcf603597ef2c2b747","title":"france v peru world cup 2018 live","story":"Kylian Mbappé’s first-half goal was enough to see France into the knockout stages and knock Peru outIf you want to rate the players, you can do so right here.

Peru are out. Like Morocco, the South American were brilliant in attack until they got to the opposing box. Their play was entertaining and their fans were beautiful but all they can do now in this tournament is kill off Australia’s hopes of pipping Denmark to the next round.

Nearly everyone gathers in the French box for a Hail Mary delivery. It sails out of play for a goalkick.90+2 min: The French freekick is headed to the edge of the area. Matuidi tries to lash it into the net.

It was a gentle shot, in truth. 87 min: Freekick to Peru and a booking for Pogba after Farfan goes down in a heap after both men jumped for a bouncing ball. Pogba did catch him in the face with his trailing arm but it wasn’t intentional and can’t have hurt. But Peru have a shooting chance from about 25 yards, dead central.85 min: Corner to Peru.

It’s as if the Peruvian is conducting his own examination of the health of Fekir following the aborted move to Liverpool.80 min: Flores booked because Aquino clobbered Fekir as soon as the French sub get a touch. Confused? So was the ref, but VAR informs him - or was it Quino himself? - of his error so he cancels the card for Flores and shows it to Aquino instead. 77 min: Peru keep plugging away but France are making it very tough for them to penetrate.75 min: Carrillo crosses from the right. Farfan, running in beyond the far post, stretches and tries to turn it into the net from an acute angle. It’s a good effort but finds only the sidenetting.74 min: Pogba hoofs the ball clear as Peru try to build another attack. No one can accuse him of being over flashy today.72 min: France exert a bit of pressure up the other end for the first time in a while. But Matuidi’s attempted cross from the left is charged down. Peru are going to fight till the end, that much is plain!70 min: Guerero forces Umtiti into the concession of a corner. The Peru fans - meaning, almost the entire crowd - go wild! And then they groan in unison when the ref awards a freekick to France as soon as the corner is delivered.68 min: Guerrero sends a shot over the bar from 20 yards.67 min: Peru are pressing hard for an equaliser. France are defending en masse. You get the sense something is brewing here: either a goal for Peru or a breakaway strike for France. “My World Cup hero was Signor Bruno Conti from 1982,” hurrahs Italo Cerullo. “Dark, flowing locks an impish, bustling style, he gave Italy (finally!) the impetus to attack, be brave and win the whole darn thing that glorious year. And he scored a cracker against Peru in an opening round match with a cheeky Cruyff Turn and screamer into “El Loco” Ramon Quiroga’s top corner. Bravissimo Bruno.”64 min: After a good bout of pressure from Peru, France try to deflate them with a spell of keep-ball. It doesn’t last long. “My World Cup hero was Jorge Campos: what’s not to love?” parps J Sims. “The ‘94 and ‘98 World Cups were brought to life for me by the flamboyant Mexican goalkeeper, too short for the position and in his wild shirts, but he jumped and ran and was so energetic he used the force of his personality to hold back the opposition. He could strike the ball well too (scored tonnes of goals at club level for Pumas) and would be all over the pitch at the end of the match when they needed a goal. Best memories.”62 min: More neat play from Peru, working a shooting opportunity for Carrillo. His drive from 25-yards flies over the bar.61 min: Twice within a minute Peru slice through the French defence and get to the byline. But their crosses - first from Advincula and then from Farfan - fail to find a man.60 min: Cueva dashes in-field from the left wing. But Pavard, who’s been better today than in the first game, brings his run to an end and then passes the ball back to Lloris, who donks it out for a throw-in. 58 min: Peru do get on the front foot. And they work their way right up to the edge of the French area, where Cueva can’t get off a shot because French defenders close him down quickly. “After seeing the replay, how is that goal credited to Mbappe instead of Giroud?” fumes Eric Schwab. “It was past the keeper and unstoppably on its way into the goal before Mbappe touched it. If Mbappe had been a defender, that would be a goal to Giroud, not an OG.”56 min: A French corner is cleared. But France will be back in Peruvian territory soon. Peru aren’t being allowed to get on the front foot at the minute.54 min: Pogba takes the freekick short. France fanny about a bit and the attack fizzles out.53 min: France’s freekick comes to nowt. Nevermind, they’ve now got another one in a similar position. Meanwhile, Willem van Schaink points out that it was Rob Rensenbrink, not Rep, who hit the post late in the ‘78 final.52 min: Guerrero, trying to help out his defence, fouls Hernandez, giving France a freekick in a promising position on the left wing.50 min: Varane slashes an attempted clearance to Farfan, enabling Peru to prolong the pressure. Aquino is teed up for a shot from 25 yards. He hits a beauty. But it bounces off the post and out!47 min: A long kick out by Gallese. Umtiti and Farfan jumps for it and the Frenchman goes down in pain. The stretcher-bearers hurry on but it looks like a dead leg rather than anything more serious. He’ll try to run it off. “I think Johnny Rep would have been more of a World Cup Hero if he had scored in the last minute of the final in 1978 rather than hit the post,” interjects Bob Kirk. “The whole history of South America might have changed.”46 min: The teams are back. Peru have made a couple of substitutions: Santamaria and Farfan are on for Yotun and Rodriguez. I think that equates to Peru going for it. “Uruguay’s Enzo Francescoli was my World Cup hero, of course,” reveals Oliver Dungey. “It makes no sense on one level (OK, several levels) but so much sense on another. He was the James Dean of Mexico ’86: not much output but he spoke to your inner cool. And what is sport if it’s not about being cool.” Indeed. And Francescoli was so cool he was also Zinedine Zidane’s hero (he even named his first born after him)The most criticised player in the world, as Pogba called himself this week, is playing very well. rather than slow things down or disappear, he’s been an intelligent and deft conduit of French attacks. No superfluous touches, just classy ones. Encore! “My World Cup hero comes from 2006,” announces Patrick Cleary. “It was 2006, I was nine years old, and the woeful United States was trying to avoid further humiliation in a match against Italy after a 3-0 thrashing at the hands of the Czech Republic. Brian McBride, the Fulham FC striker who grew up 30 minutes down the road from me, was on the bloody receiving end of a Danielle De Rossi elbow in the 28th minute. He wiped off the blood, got a few stitches on his left eyelid, and finished the 90 minutes, leading the US to their only point in that World Cup. Brian and I now go to the same barber.”That was an rollicking half! Peru set the tempo but France responded in kind, and then some. Playing with skill and elegant simplicity, Les Bleus took the lead and continue to look dangerous. Peru, who missed a great chance to take the lead earlier, have a big problem: they need to find a goal to avoid elimination: and that could entail leaving themselves even more exposed to French counter-attacks. They’re be more goals in this one, I’ll wager*.45 min: Lovely play by Giroud, taking down the ball and then twisting past Ramos and feeding Griezmann. Peru eventually snuff out the danger but that was the latest example of what Giroud has brought to France today: he’s fully justified his selection. And given his impressive scoring rate for France (nearly one goal every two matches), don’t be surprised to see him find the net at some point in this game.44 min: Peru need half-time. They’re looking a tad weary and France have found an ominous groove. At last.42 min: After some patient play in midfield, France suddenly turned up the speed and zoom through Peru. Griezmann collects the ball near the D and helps it on to Hernandez, charging in from the left. Hernandez unloads a ferocious shot that Gallese bats away.40 min: Mbappé leads a French raid down the right. Players in blue hurtle forward in support. He picks out Griezmann, haring through the middle. Griezmann tries to ping it on to Giroud, but his attempted pass is too heavy, allowing the keeper to intervene. 39 min: The Peruvian fans are still singing their hearts out, and their team are doing their utmost to give them something to celebrate more to celebrate. but France are defending well and looking menacing when they zoom forward. “My World Cup hero was Mario Kempes from Argentina ‘78,” booms Seamus O’Reilly. “The first World Cup with which I was truly engaged. I was too young and innocent to know about the filthy politics behind the host’s tournament win and idolized their six-goal striker who seemed to dance through defences. Ironically - given today’s South American representative - two of his six goals were in that, shall we call it, ‘dubious’ win over Peru. I didn’t care then and I don’t care now. A World Cup deity.”35 min: That was an almost perfect goal from France’s viewpoint: the precision and efficiency they’ve been looking for from their gifted players. No frills. Deadly.Peru lose the ball in midfield. Giroud makes a canny run and Pogba finds him with a quick and clever pass Giroud shoots first time from nine yards. It takes a nick off a defender and loops over the keeper and Mbappé follows up to tap into the net from close range!30 min: Flores beats Pavard and puts in a low cross. Guerrero gets to it before Umtiti and finds himself with a clear shot at goal from 12 yards but very little time! He bangs it hard with his left foot but straight at Lloris, who saves well with his feet!26 min: Peru with a long throw-in. No Iran-style tumble beforehand. And not much length, either. France clear. The game is tightening up here: still being played at a cracking pace but space is hard to find. “My World Cup hero was the great Russia keeper Lev Yashin, the Black Spider,” coos Daniel Jeffreys. “As a 1970s goalkeeper for Monk’s Park School in Bristol, Yashin represented everything I wanted to be - a great keeper, a darkly exotic existential figure in his all-black kit and wickedly handsome. I was so enamoured that in 1968 I made myself a black goalkeeper’s jersey with a number 1 and Yashin’s name in white gaffer tape. Little did I know that I had invented sports merchandising. To refer to your earlier thread, Yashin saved over 150 penalty kicks in professional football – more than any other goalkeeper. Now there’s a hero of the Soviet Union for you.” Great call, Daniel. And who knew Yashin turned out as a ringer for Monk’s Park School in Bristol?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ead18efecd3bee3de6607106ae7bba3ad4f8fb0/0_50_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adc1471a1f19b6d349d26287015fb665","title":"considering not having children or decided to stay child free share your experiences","story":"We want to hear from you if you have either definitely decided or are considering not having childrenThe assumption that women will become mothers is being tested more than ever.The US birth rate has hit an all-time low, and British women are having fewer children than they have in the last 10 years.If you have decided not to have children, or if you are considering remaining child-free, we would like to hear from you.

I call my approach Root to Fruit eating. It is a philosophy that aims to make it easier for people to cook good food, blending a little chef’s knowhow with academic research, and making it applicable to home cooks and professionals alike. My shopping list comes in at just over £18 a week – cheaper than the average national weekly spend per person of £24. Over a year, that’s a saving of about £300 while still enjoying top-quality food (I buy everything from my local independent health-food shop or market, or organic items from the supermarket. Of course, if you need to bring the cost of your shopping down further, buy non-organic). I’m a vegetarian, so there is no meat on my shopping list, and eating less meat is certainly a good way of keeping costs down. However, if you are buying meat, opt for cheaper cuts of higher-welfare animals.That margin is there to cover the cost of rent, staff, utilities and, if you’re lucky, a profit. But chefs love good produce, so they devise other ways to keep their costs down, turning scraps that cost pennies into a fine meal for which patrons are happy to pay pounds. Noma, for example – one of the best restaurants in the world – serves cod’s head as a main course. Taking on board a chef’s thrift in the kitchen will help you save money while eating healthily and sustainably – as my guide and recipes show.The best chefs will buy local and seasonal ingredients where possible. Pineapples and pomegranates are luxuries to be enjoyed, but base the bulk of your weekly shop on seasonal produce from the market or through a veg box scheme and you will have a double win, improving the taste and economy. Alongside your basics (eggs, milk, butter, cheese, bread etc) choose a variety of fresh fruit and vegetables including legumes, brassicas and roots. Chefs buy in bulk it’s cheaper in the long run and reduces unnecessary packaging. Store cupboard items are an investment – you can build up a variety over time. Having a few key items in the store cupboard is a great way to ensure there is always an affordable meal in the house. Dried pulses come with a low price tag – even when they are organic – and a little goes a long way. Just 5p’s-worth (60g per person) will provide the bulk of a meal. Other items such as lentils, grains, dried fruit, nuts and seeds will give you a variety of delicious ingredients to experiment with making your own dishes.

Top with the nuts, rhubarb and molasses.Eat like Yotam Ottolenghi and make colourful lunch salads using nutritious grains, seeds, dried fruit and seasonal vegetables. Use up the odds and ends from the fridge and take advantage of those leftovers. My pesto pasta recipe is a great example of how you can make a meal out of store cupboard ingredients and everyday vegetables.Carrot- and beetroot-top pesto pasta Edible greens from root vegetables are delicious ingredients in their own right.

Otherwise, invent your own dish. With fresh vegetables, you can’t go wrong. Roast, saute or simmer vegetables, toss them with herbs or toasted spices and serve them with a grain of your choice. About 50g of rye, barley, spelt or rice (10-16p) is a good portion. Or be inventive and concoct your own soup or stew to use up the withered vegetables hiding at the back of the fridge.Spiced rice, roasted broccoli, carrot and peanut saladI live off salads such as this.

Baby’s gotta eat \u0026amp I had votes,’ Karina Gould says after a swift reaction to footage of her feeding her babyCanada’s health minister was being grilled in the House of Commons over the country’s plans to legalise recreational marijuana by mid-October, but it was the scene playing out behind Ginette Petitpas Taylor that catapulted the moment into headlines: one row over, during a raucous Question Period, Liberal MP Karina Gould was breastfeeding her three-month-old son.In March, Gould became Canada’s first federal minister to have a baby while in office. The minister of Democratic Institutions returned to work in May with her son Oliver in tow, introducing him to her Liberal colleagues, including Justin Trudeau, the country’s prime minister.Gould soon chimed in. “No shame in breastfeeding! Baby’s gotta eat \u0026amp I had votes,” she said on social media, adding that she was glad to have parliamentary colleagues that were supportive.Dozens responded to her tweet, many of them thanking her for blazing a trail forward. “Breaking one barrier at a time. Good work Karina,” noted one. “Thinking back to not very long ago, betting there would have a been a major meltdown over this. Glad we have matured and progressed,” wrote another.Some seem surprised that a shot of Gould breastfeeding was making headlines at all.Others pointed out that the ability to strike this kind of balance between motherhood and work remains an option for a limited few in Canada. “Great to bring more attention. we just need to be aware most Canadians are not privileged this way w a job that provides flexibility nor do they have a national stage to make this popular.”Those who chastised Gould for not covering up or stepping into her office to breastfeed were quickly rebuked online. “Feeding your baby ‘takes women backwards’? Using our breasts as they were meant to be used ‘takes women backwards’? No. Shaming women who feed their babies in public is what takes us backwards. Get a grip,” replied one to a criticism of the Liberal minister.In 2016, Unnur Brá Konráðsdóttir, an MP with Iceland’s conservative Independence party, made waves as she nursed her baby while addressing parliament about an immigration bill she had put forward.The viral video – showing Konráðsdóttir breastfeeding as she urged parliamentarians to support her motion to strip asylum seekers of some of their rights – led some to criticise media for choosing to focus on what a woman was doing with her body rather than what she was saying at the time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11640b00055692cb671bde77d6b4494134126ee7/0_1095_5462_3277/master/5462.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab2d4a8589f047b9b609503b6812b62f","title":"roisin murphy pops about putting across the primitive parts of yourself","story":"The former Moloko singer on the freedom and heartbreak that inspired her favourite tracks from her back catalogue by  Jude Rogers Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi for the In a desperately fashionable pub garden in Hackney (“it’s like fucking New York round here now, isn’t it?”), Róisín Murphy is swearily and majestically holding court. “Me making music happened not even from a desire to make records,” she begins, as we go over the 25 years since Murphy emerged as one half of Sheffield-based ravers, Moloko. After dazzling at the turn of the century with smash dance hits Sing It Back and The Time Is Now, they imploded in 2003, with Murphy going on to build a wonderfully unruly and rich solo career, following her own path. “I’ve always done things that way because of the life that I lived, you know?”Murphy’s musical education began early with her wayward Irish family. “They were wheeler-dealers, always only working for themselves, laying roads, collecting antiques, whatever – that gave me a kind of freedom.” Her dad was a fantastic singer who loved playing with words (“a character – a bollix! – but I love him”), while her uncle was a jazz bandleader who commanded a crowd (“pitch-perfect – when people drank, everything revolved around him”).“It was a pretty sort of out-there thing for our first,” says Murphy, proudly. Its drum programming foreshadowed early jungle, she says, and its lyrics – about reincarnation, blind men filling up with light and birds with nowhere to fly – are psychedelic and strange. “I was aware that I wasn’t experienced enough to write a soul song at that point, and even said it in interviews: I would be bullshitting you if I wrote about how painful my last breakup was, because it wasn’t. So I went somewhere else – into my head, my imagination, to a place where I was acting, playing parts, like performance art.” She has felt happy in that place ever since.By Moloko’s last album, Murphy could write soul songs. 2003’s Statues was made after she broke up with Brydon, the only person with whom she had ever made music. “It felt like maybe I’m destroying everything. Maybe I’m not going to be able to make records without him. What the fuck have I done with the last eight years? I was 29. Worried, to say the least.”Forever More is a “fucking masterpiece,” she gushes – the arrangement by producer and long-term associate Eddie Stevens remains one of her favourites. It begins darkly with squelchy sub-bass, before disco brass turns Murphy’s lovelorn lyrics (“Gotta find me somebodyBut there’s nobody to love me”) into prime Salsoul material.Do her and Brydon ever talk now? “No, not much, no. Very rarely, something comes up where I have to ring him, and he goes: ‘Ugh. It’s not you, is it?’”Murphy’s first solo album, 2005’s Ruby Blue, was made after she moved nervously from Sheffield to London. “London seemed like an alien landscape. My world was a tiny bubble before – even the band were slightly outside me and Mark, and then everything else totally outside of that.” Producer Matthew Herbert had been pushing Murphy to work with him, and when she finally agreed, he said to bring something to facilitate their first session. “I thought he meant something inspiring, so I brought this Brian Eno article about a project called the Long Now, about him putting a clock into a cliff that counts for 700 years – I thought maybe it could inspire a song. And Matthew, says: ‘OK, hit it across the microphone.’” She laughs. “That was the start! And then I was bringing hairspray, hairdryers, shoes ...”Through Time is like a 21st-century Dusty Springfield song, all soft melodies and featherlight electronic backing. Herbert taught Murphy the benefits of structure in the studio, too: he did an 11am – 6pm working day, which she still sticks to (“and I always come out with something”). He also taught Murphy about her voice being just a thing in her music. “He uses found sound. He made me realise I was a found sound too.”EMI signed Murphy soon after and she made the brilliant, full-throttle pop album Overpowered – before disaster struck again. Murphy’s boss at EMI took the record straight to someone he knew at the top of BBC Radio 1, who took it on holiday with his wife on his return, he said they both loved it, then added they weren’t going to play it at the station. “So the whole thing about these men running the industry, blah-blah, it can be counterproductive. If we’d promoted Overpowered from the ground up, a different thing might have happened. Because someone knew the right guy, it destroyed my chance.”The fantastically dark, gloopy R\u0026ampB of Primitive is Murphy’s favourite track from the album, written in Miami with Ill Factor and Jimmy Douglass, Timbaland’s mentor. Its tale of animalistic instincts reflects a regular theme in Murphy’s work. “I mean, who gets to put primordial soup in the first line of a song? That idea of not always being in control of the primitive parts of yourself, the bits that fall in love or the bits that dance or lose the plot or drink too much, and putting that across … that’s pop for me. It’s playing with all the different colours of the rainbow of life.”Featuring lyrics such as “Never underestimate creative peopleAnd the depths that they will go”, the nine-minute, percussive Exploitation was a bold statement. “It really was – ‘Don’t fucking underestimate me, because this is going to be murder.’ At the time, I was meeting people who thought I should be doing dance music, people who thought I should be poppier ...” She sighs. “And I feel very strongly about this: I feel like I should really say this to all artists, especially new artists: don’t look to the people who don’t have vision. Don’t listen to them! They’re not there for that. They’re only there to help you along the way.”2015’s Take Her Up to Monto continued the theme of Murphy making complex, ornate pop songs with playful cover art to the fore – she’s a workman in a hi-vis jacket on this album cover, a nod to some of her family’s background laying roads, she says, with a wink. “But certain images are stuck in people’s minds about me. Like the Time Is Now video, God forbid, which is like a fucking Timotei ad. They forget the strength in it, and just think: ‘A lovely blondie girl with her hair flowing.’ It’s difficult to overcome what that leaves in people’s minds, but I try!”Murphy hates how record companies retreat from more intellectual songs these days. She talks gushingly about Cole Porter’s Let’s Do It, Let’s Fall in Love. “There’s irony in it, subtlety, reading, education, knowledge and understanding in spades. But if you gave it to a record company now, they’d be like: ‘It’s too clever. Too urbane. It’s referencing Darwin, dear.’ She blasts “idiots” coming into music studios since the 1990s saying things such as: “Keep it simple, stupid.” “I mean, what’s the point in saying the same thing over and over again? I can write a pop song – I wrote Sing It Back, I wrote Time Is Now, for fuck’s sake. It’s a bloody brick wall that we’re running into today. I’ve worked all my life not to be a simpleton. I’m not starting now.”Until recently, Murphy didn’t really realise she had a great voice. “I’m very throwaway about it because I just opened my gob one day and it came out. It wasn’t like something I had to work at like writing lyrics, or styling myself, or directing videos.” Nevertheless, she had never enjoyed hearing her speaking voice, finding it difficult to speak on stage. “But I’m doing things on Instagram now, where I’ll be able to bring myself to say: ‘Hello, I’m Róisín Murphy’ and it feels OK at last. It feels like me too.”Stefan Kozalla – DJ Koze – approached Murphy to do a track because he loved her voice she wrote this song over his beats in a studio with an engineer. Her original draft had a chorus that Kozalla took off completely, replacing it with a bit of her studio chat: “Me literally telling the engineer, ‘I need a bit of light here’. And he repeats it, ends it back, and I’m all like, ‘Brilliant’, and he’s all like, ‘Really?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah’, and he was like: ‘I love you.’” She laughs. “But that’s me! That’s really me.”Murphy’s all for the layers of gloss being stripped from pop culture. “I’d say no to fans asking for a photo a few years ago, because I wanted to control my image. I knew it’d mean them posting me looking hammered with my arm round somebody.” She felt bad about it, she says. “So now I always say yes. This is how it is now. People want the raw thing. You can’t hide. And that’s OK.”It’s been funny going full circle and returning to Sheffield, she says. “It’s weird in a way – it’s like I’ve bypassed my past. But Sheffield gave me the sense of where all music came from, and it’s good to remember that. It was the perfect size of city, where I worked out the connection between electro into house into hip-hop into soul music and back again. And it saved me, you know, music: being something just to immerse yourself into and be obsessed with, which leads you to be interested in other things.” She smiles. “Do you know what I mean?

As the clock to Brexit ticks down, we must prepare for every eventuality, including no deal. This is neither a desired nor a likely outcome. But it is not an impossible one. And we are getting ready just in case.“We will use all the tools at our disposal, which could have a cushioning impact. The new long-term budget for our union from 2021 onwards has an in-built flexibility that could allow us to redirect funds if the situation arose.“We will also earmark €120m (£105m) for a new peace programme which has done so much in breaking down barriers between communities in Northern Ireland and the border counties.”Juncker has put Martin Selmayr, the commission president’s former chief of staff, who is now the European commission’s secretary-general, in charge of preparations for a no-deal scenario.Selmayr has drawn up a series of legislative changes that would be needed in the event of the UK crashing out. He has even raised the unlikely prospect of requiring UK citizens to apply for a visa to visit EU member states.A senior UK government source warned that a no-deal outcome would only suit the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. “If we were, God forbid, to get into the situation where you had a sour orce and an acrimonious future relationship, I don’t think that does any good for anybody,” the source said. “That’s a complete lose-lose situation. “The only people who’d have a smile on their faces are people in the Kremlin and elsewhere who wish European democracies ill.”To avoid a border both on the island of Ireland and in the Irish sea, the British government has so far proposed that the UK as a whole effectively stays in the customs union for a limited period after Brexit, until a technological solution to the border issue emerges.It is expected to further propose after next week’s summit of leaders in Brussels that the UK remains in regulatory alignment with the EU on goods, to ensure all border checks are unnecessary.Juncker, however, told the Irish parliament the EU would not allow the UK to use the Irish issue to gain single market access without freedom of movement and membership of the full ecosystem of the bloc’s institutions, including the European court of justice.He said: “Our backstop is a bespoke and workable solution. It is designed for Northern Ireland and upholds its constitutional status.“But this tailored solution for Northern Ireland cannot fit the whole United Kingdom. It covers all necessary customs and regulatory controls to avoid a hard border. And it does not prejudice the future relationship between the UK and the European Union.“With less than 10 months to Brexit, we need more answers and fewer new questions. We will continue – my friend Michel Barnier, myself and others – to take a pragmatic approach to finding solutions. But I also want to be clear: Ireland will come first.“There are those who think that the other 26 countries will abandon Ireland at the last minute for a sectoral deal that suits them. Those people have not understood what being part of our union means. Ireland’s border is Europe’s border – and it is our union’s priority.”A senior UK cabinet source claimed the EU’s proposal failed to address the concerns of nationalist and unionist communities. “There have been some serious questions about what we have put on the table but it has not been rejected,” the source said. “What is absolutely essential is that the approach that is agreed is demonstrably balanced and fair to both communities in Northern Ireland. No solution is going to ensure if it is going to be rejected by one community or the other.”Varadkar, at a press conference with Juncker, said he believed there was an “urgent need to intensify efforts” in order to achieve a withdrawal agreement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/017aee012f933fa1feeef44c0ad49d17b53e2225/82_0_1735_1041/master/1735.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26ca013fad8cdceb0a0fd7ddadb7b1ae","title":"gagging clauses cost house of commons 24m in five years","story":"Fifty-three settlements with staff including confidentiality clauses signed in 2013-17The House of Commons has spent more than £2.4m on so-called gagging clauses for staff over the last five years, official figures show.A total of 53 non-disclosure agreements were signed between 2013 and 2017, at a cost of £2,407,176.78, according to data released under the Freedom of Information Act. Concerns have been raised that parliamentary staff who claim to have been bullied have been asked to sign such agreements to prevent their claims from becoming public. Angus Sinclair, a former private secretary to the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, told the BBC he was given “compulsory early retirement”, with an £86,250 payoff dependent on him signing a non-disclosure agreement barring him from making complaints about his treatment in the house. Bercow has strenuously denied claims made against him. understands that a committee set up by Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, to review the house’s bullying policy is expected to rule that a new code will apply only to future behaviour. Such a move would anger unions who say staff who have been bullied or harassed in the past deserve an opportunity to seek redress. The figures were unearthed by the Press Association. Commons authorities confirmed that every settlement agreement included confidentiality clauses, which they said did not prevent those who signed them from whistleblowing. Eleven agreements were signed in 2013, costing a total of £916,082.43, 14 in 2014 (£405,682.08), five in 2015 (£182,706.21) and 15 in 2016 (£584,893). Last year eight non-disclosure agreements were signed, costing a total of £317,813.06.Leadsom said the figures were surprising. “Whilst we don’t know the details of each of these cases, if any relate to the way an inidual has been treated, it further highlights the importance of changing the culture in Westminster,” she said. “The independent complaints and grievance procedure, which I hope will be implemented in the coming months, will help complainants achieve that by placing them at the heart of the process.”Maria Miller, the chair of the women and equalities committee, called for greater transparency over payments from the public purse. A House of Commons spokesman said: “Like many other organisations, the House of Commons uses settlement agreements to resolve employment disputes under certain circumstances. The House of Commons, which employs around 2,500 members of staff, follows the guidance on settlement agreements provided by Acas and the Cabinet Office.”The treatment of parliamentary staff is currently governed by a respect policy, which is being reviewed after a raft of allegations of bullying and sexual harassment. The claims are usually made by junior members of staff against senior MPs or managers. Leadsom set up a steering group which is drawing up a new independent complaints and grievance policy.Informed sources have told the  the steering group is expected to conclude within weeks that the new policy should not be retrospective. This will mean outstanding claims against a number of MPs could be set aside, union officials say.In an article in Friday’s edition of The House magazine, Amy Leversidge, the assistant general secretary of the FDA union, says some parliamentary staff deserve to have their cases heard. “The steering group must … make sure the new policy finds a fair way to deal with past behaviours. Trust and confidence will not be restored if past behaviours go unaddressed,” she writes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d2a3ce5c060a8a8aa49f979764b9d30f95c761d/0_1_4845_2907/master/4845.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3057077881c64e1447b551afae3af577","title":"uk unveils post brexit eu citizen settlement scheme","story":"Home Office promises online fast-track registration process with staff available to helpThe government has promised to fast-track the registration process for EU citizens who want to stay in the UK after Brexit, with decisions on applications to remain in the country reduced from six months to “a matter of days”.Unveiling details of the “settlement scheme” for EU citizens, the Home Office promised that the application process would be “short, simple and user friendly” with a default position of accepting rather than rejecting applications.Applicants will be asked to prove their identity, that they have no convictions, and that they currently live in the UK.The answers will then be compared to a database with the aim of giving the quickest answer possible.Sajid Javid, the home secretary, said: “With the scheme, we’re meeting our commitment to secure the rights of EU citizens who are already in this country, contributing in so many ways, they’re working, they’re studying, or for other reasons.“We want them to stay and we want to make that process of staying as easy as possible.”The scheme will open on a phased basis later this year and applications can be made online or smart phones, according to a 57-page “statement of intent” document published by the Home Office on Thursday. Passports and photographs can be posted or scanned in by owners of android mobiles but not iPhones.Applications will cost £65 per adult, with children half price. EU citizens will be issued with an ID number, but not a physical card, which they will be required to use for public services such as the NHS and possibly employment and property rental checks.Having faced steady criticism in the past 18 months over its treatment of EU citizens, the Home Office is promising to offer “human” contact for anyone who needs help. Caseworkers will be based in libraries and home visits will be offered to people who are housebound or in residential care. Carers, stay-at-home parents, retired people and students are eligible for settled status with no proof of income. Irish citizens will not have to apply but will have to provide proof of residency if they have non-EU spouses who want to remain in the UK. It has been estimated that the Home Office will have to process up to 4,500 applications a day to get through 3.2m applications before the programme closes in June 2021. However, numbers could be even higher, with the Home Office saying there could be anything from “3.2m to 3.8m” EU citizens eligible for the scheme.Applicants will be asked to submit their passport or ID cards along with a passport or digital photograph and the Home Office will then automatically check Revenue and Customs (HMRC), and Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) records for proof they have been living in the UK. Sources said the tax and benefits records were not a surveillance operation but “a proxy for proof of residence”. Anyone with a criminal record involving a jail sentence of more than 12 months is at risk of being rejected. Checks on the national police database and watch lists will be automatic but past crimes in the rest of Europe will not be automatic.If EU citizens do not wish to apply using their national insurance number and tax records, the Home Office will accept other proof of residence, including council tax bills, rental or mortgage statements, and utility bills. “Our default position will be to grant status,” Javid told the Lords EU justice sub-committee. “We will be looking to grant status as quickly as we can. We will not be looking for excuses at all to not grant status. It will be driven by default view, you provide this information, if you’re not going to be granted status there will have to be a very serious reason.”He said the Home Office would do everything to prevent another scandal like that around Windrush generation people. “A number of mistakes were made,” he said. “There were clearly people from the Windrush generation that were badly treated. We want to make sure we learn all the lessons from that.”The Home Office, condemned for taking six months to process applications for permanent residency, said it believed the system was now so automated with the HMRC and DWP checks that ID numbers would be issued “in a matter of days”. One of the main groups campaigning for the rights of EU citizens, the3million, urged the Home Office to think again about charging people. “If the government is really committed, it should remove all barriers including fees,” the founder, Nicolas Hatton, said. “Today’s statement will give hope to many EU citizens, but questions remain whether the Home Office will have the capacity to change the hostile environment culture to a welcoming approach.” It will be opening a contact centre with 1,500 staff, including caseworkers proactively making calls to people.“We will work with applicants to help them avoid any errors or omissions,” the Home Office said. The scheme will be launched in the late summer with specially selected test groups, and the system will be rolled out in the following months, becoming fully operational by 30 March next year. It will remain open for two and a half years, with EU citizens who arrive in the country eligible to apply right up until the end of December 2019, the proposed end of the transition period. Those in the country for less than five years will be granted “pre-settled status” which can be swapped for a full “settled status” ID after five years.The new status will also be considered a route to British citizenship, ending the need for EU citizens presently in the country to go through the permanent residency process. Close family members, defined as “spouse, civil partner, durable partner, dependent child or grandchild or dependent parent or grandparent living overseas” will be allowed to join those with settled status under a “lifetime right” of EU citizens already in the country. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, said “far more” answers were needed from the government “about what happens to those who aren’t registered by June 2021 through no fault of their own, such as children”.Immigration minister Caroline Nokes was also unable to guarantee the scheme would hold in the event of no deal.But Roger Casale, founder of the New Europeans campaign group, said the fact it was rolling it out before a Brexit deal is sealed “amounts to a unilateral guarantee to EU27 citizens who will now get settled status regardless of whether the withdrawal agreement is ratified or not”. The Federation of Small Business also warned the government that the cost to settle was still high for low income EU workers saying it was imperative the process was “affordable” for all to ensure workforces weren’t stripped of their EU employees."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cd7fb10085dbde9b0806023589d59d4e2b49109/0_238_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc9acc28cf7aa730dad1831037e60987","title":"brexit government concession to tory pro europeans doesnt change anything says rees mogg politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenHere are the main lines from Theresa May’s press conferenceThe government is absolutely committed to increasing airport capacity at Heathrow. This is important, it is part of our future as global Britain, and the ambitions we have as a trading nation for the future. And the foreign secretary, early next week, will be what I would describe as a living embodiment of global Britain. He will be out there showing the UK’s continued presence around the world and the work that the UK continues to do around the world, with our diplomacy, working on so many of the issues and the challenges that we face across the world today.May did not say where Johnson would be on Monday. There is a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg that day, but Johnson’s deputy, Sir Alan Duncan, is representing the UK at that meeting.She also told another reporter who asked about this:The United Kingdom is a leading member of the Nato alliance, a leading defence nation, and that will continue. If you look at our defence budget, we’re the second biggest defence budget in Nato, we’re the biggest defence budget in Europe, and we have committed to significant sums, £179bn of spend on new equipment over the next decade or so.According to the FT (paywall), “although there is no formal definition of what constitutes a tier one power, the MoD has interpreted it as having a full spectrum of military capabilities, including an independent nuclear deterrent and a navy, army and air force capable of being deployed anywhere in the world.”That’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.Q: How can the relationship with America be fixed?May says it will continue. There are some issues on which we disagree, such as on the Iran nuclear deal. But in the groups in which we come together we can express our disagreements.Q: If expanding Heathrow is an important part of your ambitions for global Britain, shouldn’t Boris Johnson come back to vote for it on Monday night?May says Johnson will be an embodiment of global Britain on Monday, out there making the case for Britain.Q: Are you committed to the UK remaining a “tier one” defence nation? (See 5.03pm.) Are you willing to use that phrase? Defence chief worry that you are not committed to that.May says Britain will continue to be a leading defence nation. But she does not use the phrase “tier one”.Q: Are you worried Trump will walk away from Nato?Stoltenberg says he thinks Trump is committed to Nato. He has said so, and said he is committed to article 5. And Trump has shown his commitment. It is about actions as well as words. He has stepped up the American commitment in Europe. Stoltenberg says there are disagreements with America.But this has happened before, and the Nato alliance has been able to overcome those differences. He is confident that can happen again.Q: Where you annoyed by reports that you have questioned the UK’s military role?That is a reference to the Financial Times splash (paywall). This is how it starts.Theresa May has asked Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, to justify Britain’s role as a “tier one” military power, throwing Ministry of Defence plans to modernise the armed forces into disarray just weeks before a crucial Nato summit.At a tense meeting this week, the prime minister said Mr Williamson needed to rethink the capabilities needed to be a modern military force and focus more on Britain’s cyber warfare capability to meet new threats, including Russia.Senior officials said Mrs May’s intervention created “shockwaves” at the MoD, with some claiming she appeared to be questioning Britain’s role as a global military player. “People have their head in their hands,” said one official.May says the UK is a leading defence nation. That will continue. The UK has the second largest defence budget in Europe and is the biggest defence nation in Europe, she says.He says Britain has led in Nato by example.What makes Nato unique is the transatlantic bond, he says.He says some people are questioning that bond now.But Europe and America have had their differences before, he says. He says the relationship has survived.Theresa May is giving her press conference now.She say she welcomes the steps Nato countries have taken to increase defence spending.Europe is shouldering more of the burden, but it must continue to do more.At next month’s summit Nato leaders expect to agree an ambitious package of measures.But it needs to become more bureaucratic, so it can respond more quickly, she says.Theresa May will shortly hold a press conference at the end of her talks with Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general.Earlier Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister, gave a speech at Lancaster House. As my colleague Ewen MacAskill writes in his preview story, Stoltenberg called for Nato unity.The Brexit department has published another paper today on how the UK and the EU could cooperate after Brexit on security matters (pdf). It is only six pages long, and it does not contain any surprises, but it does confirm that, on security, what the UK wants after Brexit is something as close as possible to what is in place now.For example, it proposes ongoing cooperation on sanctions (pointing out that many existing EU sanctions “derive from UK information and analysis”), on development policy, on defence projects and defence capability development priorities, on election observation missions and even in consular affairs (“in 2017, through its global network, the UK provided consular services to 207 EU citizens where they were unrepresented by their own member state, and the UK is open to continuing this service on a reciprocal basis”).It also stresses that the UK wants a level of cooperation beyond what is currently available to other “third countries” (countries outside the EU). This is problematic because the EU says that, after Brexit, the UK will be a third country, and that this necessarily places a limit how much cooperation there can be.Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has said that EU nationals living in the UK should be able to get settled status for free, without having to pay the £65 fee announced today. (See 1.14pm.) There are approximately one million EU citizens living in London. They are part of the fabric of this city – working hard, paying taxes and playing a major role in our civic and cultural life. Their rights need to be protected and so do the rights of the British citizens living across the continent. It is disappointing that the government has not used today as an opportunity to show EU nationals living in the UK goodwill by making this process free of charge to people resident in our country. At the very least, those who moved here before the referendum took place shouldn’t be expected to pay to stay.In the Commons earlier Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, made a statement about universal credit. It was more of an update than an announcement of anything new, and according to the Press Association McVey gave a very positive gloss on how the project was going. She said it was a “unique example of great British innovation” and a world leader in benefits.But opposition MPs weren’t impressed, and McVey was strongly criticised.The SNP’s economy spokeswoman Kirsty Blackman said universal credit “pushing families into poverty and hardship” and expressed fears for her Aberdeen North constituents when they transfer to the system, which merges six benefits into one, later this year. Labour’s Debbie Abrahams, a former shadow work and pensions secretary, said she could not believe what she was hearing from McVey and added: “They are in absolute denial, not just about this report.” Margaret Greenwood, the current shadow work and pensions secretary, said Universal credit is having a devastating impact on many people and will reach 8.5m people by 202425. The secretary of state must now wake up to the misery being caused by her policy.After the session Frank Field, the Labour chair of the work and pensions committee, released a statement saying:Rather than that banal offering which did nothing for our poorest constituents, a more realistic statement from the secretary of state would have acknowledged and sought to rectify the following points: Universal Credit is helping to transform the welfare state from one which protects people from poverty, to one that drives them into destitution vulnerable people face all sorts of difficulties in trying to make and manage a claim online mega sums of money are being clawed back from people’s monthly payments to cover historic debts, leaving them short of money for food, rent and utilities parents have to struggle through a brutal process and rack up debts to obtain the crucial childcare payments they need to stay in work and total chaos is unleashed on family budgets by a process of calculating monthly payments that is totally alien to working-class lives.This is not a bilateral question between Ireland and the United Kingdom - this is an issue between the UK and the European Union. We want to make it clear again and again that Ireland is not alone. We have Ireland backed by 26 member states and the commission - this will not change.I am strongly against any temptation to isolate Ireland and not to conclude the deal on Ireland. Ireland has to be part of the deal.Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, also said the withdrawal agreement would have to address the Irish border. And, for Ireland, the backstop was the most important issue, he said. He said:A withdrawal agreement without a backstop is of no use whatsoever ...Let me be blunt, there isn’t much time left if we are to conclude an agreement and have it operational by the time the United Kingdom leaves the European Union next March ...The most important aspect of the withdrawal agreement for us is the backstop, and Prime Minister May committed in March that there would be a backstop and outlined in December what that backstop would contain.The minister’s department received advice as recently as the June 7 that Capita represents a 10 out of 10 risk ...We know that Capita has a record of poor performance delivering MoD contracts, they were stripped of the defence estate contract, and the less said about their about recruitment contract the better. In spite of this, the Government has knowingly chosen to give Capita another contract. This government’s ideologically driven approach to outsourcing public services at any cost has simply failed. I believe we must end the racket of outsourcing and deliver solutions that benefit taxpayers and service users alike.Tobias Ellwood, a defence minister, said the new contract would deliver savings to the Ministry of Defence, as well as investment.Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign office minister, is speaking at a press gallery lunch today. Someone has made an effort to make her feel welcome. This is from the ’s Christopher Hope.Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, has told MPs the EU nationals living in the UK will have to pay £65 for settled status if they want to remain after Brexit. Children under 16 will have to pay £32.50. In a statement, she also confirmed what Sajid Javid, the home secretary, told peers earlier (see 11.11am) and said that EU nationals applying would just have to meet three simple conditions.Here is an extract from the Home Office’s news release.EU citizens living in the UK and their family members will need to apply under the settlement scheme to obtain their new UK immigration status. Caroline Nokes confirmed that those applying under the scheme will only need to complete three key steps. They will need to prove their identity, show that that they live in the UK, and declare that they have no serious criminal convictions.The minister also announced the planned fee for people applying under the scheme. It is proposed that an application will cost £65 and £32.50 for a child under 16. For those who already have valid permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain documentation, they will be able to exchange it for settled status for free.The Home Office will check the employment and benefit records held by government which will mean that, for many, their proof of residence will be automatic.Those who have not yet lived in the UK for five years will be granted pre-settled status and be able to apply for settled status once they reach the five-year point. From April 2019, this second application will be free of charge.The draft immigration rules which have been published today providing details of the scheme, deliver on the citizens’ rights agreement with the EU reached in March this year, which also guarantees the rights of UK nationals living in the EU ...The new online application system will be accessible through phones, tablets, laptops and computers. The government will provide support for the vulnerable and those without access to a computer, and continues to work with EU citizens’ representatives and embassies to ensure the system works for everyone.The settlement scheme will open in a phased way from later this year and will be fully open by 30 March 2019. The deadline for applications will be 30 June 2021.The Home Office will continue to engage with stakeholders, including employers, local authority representatives and community groups, about the detailed design of the scheme before the rules are laid before parliament.The Labour party has also challenged Boris Johnson to follow Greg Hands and vote against Heathrow expansion on Monday. This is from Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary.Greg Hands’ resignation piles the pressure on Boris Johnson who promised his constituents he would ‘lie down in front of the bulldozers’ to stop a third runway.Instead he is jetting off to Luxembourg on Monday to avoid the vote because he is too weak to stand by his promises.Labour opposes a third runway at Heathrow because it doesn’t meet our four tests and we are calling for a free vote for all parties on Monday.And this is from Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson.Justine Greening, the former cabinet minister and an opponent of Heathrow expansion, has criticised Downing Street for not giving Conservative MPs a free vote on the third runway.

It is 12 years in the future and neither Iain Duncan Smith nor Esther McVey have been able to find another job after losing their seats in the general election of 2021. They are to be found scavenging from bins or queueing at food banks after their universal credit payments have been delayed for six years. We can always hope.A week later than planned – nothing to do with UC ever runs to time – McVey, the work and pensions secretary, came to the Commons to explain why the National Audit Office (NAO) had completely rubbished the work of her department. On these occasions, she resembles a Duracell bunny on a remedial reading course. Head down, racing through her statement at double-quick time, studiously ignoring inconvenient truths.She began by insisting UC was leading-edge British technology that promoted agile working practices for disabled people. “France, Sweden and New Zealand have all come over to this country to see how our system works,” she said. So they can learn what not to do and design theirs completely differently.After forgetting that the only reason the UC phone helplines are now free is because the government was shamed into not charging by the opposition, McVey finally got round to the NAO report. Basically the whole thing was a load of tosh put together by a bunch of idiots who hadn’t got a clue what they were doing. If the NAO had done its job properly, it would have realised that the DWP had completely revolutionised its systems in the 10 minutes since the report had been written and that everything was now just perfect.The shadow work and pensions secretary, Margaret Greenwood, is not the most dynamic of politicians – she has yet to find a room that she cannot put to sleep – but even she can take advantage of an open goal when she sees it. All that was required was to mention a few of the more obvious failings listed in the NAO report, and she duly obliged. The rollout for UC had been put back a year for the sixth time. Four legal challenges had been upheld. Forty per cent of claimants are not even able to verify their own names on the system. Twenty-five per cent of carers and two-thirds of all disabled people had not been paid on time. Answer that.Now forced to wing it without a script, the Duracell bunny started manically spinning round and round in circles. “I’ve visited groups up and down the country and I’m doing the best I can,” McVey said, sounding rather more desperate than she intended.The opposition should stop moaning. Rather than going on about the two-thirds of disabled people who were being slowly starved to death, Labour ought to be congratulating the Department for Work and Pensions for getting money to the one third on time. Time to stop talking the country down and concentrate on the positives.Duncan Smith, the former DWP secretary who had been the brains – for want of a better word – behind UC, inevitably intervened to agree with McVey that the NAO report was “a shoddy piece of work”. The NAO might just as well have used those same words to describe IDS. And with far more reason and greater accuracy. After all, auditing is what the NAO is paid to do.“I’ve spoken to Darren from Wales,” McVey said. And he had assured her that everything to do with UC was running perfectly. It didn’t seem to have occurred to her that if she was resorting to inidual reports from random people who had got a bit lucky, then she had probably lost the argument."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc23b78fc25bff6458bb22b8df09f5910e27f80d/0_115_5045_3027/master/5045.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaf9bd044374e6ee16ed275f30d2eb05","title":"government must wake up to universal credit flaws","story":"MPs criticise government for dismissing audit that revealed failings in welfare schemeMPs have told the government to “wake up to reality” after it rejected criticism of universal credit by the public spending watchdog and insisted its faltering welfare reform was a “great British innovation”.Opposition MPs reacted angrily to a ministerial statement made on Thursday morning by the work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, in response to last week’s National Audit Office report into the troubled benefits system.The NAO concluded that universal credit, which is running six years behind schedule, is failing to deliver anticipated cost savings and employment benefits, and has left thousands of vulnerable claimants in debt and hardship.It painted a damning picture of an unwieldy, inefficient and unresponsive system that was unable to demonstrate value for money, despite £1.3bn of investment in digital technology over eight years, and was unlikely ever to do so. McVey, however, suggested the NAO report was unreliable because it had not taken into account the impact of recent changes to universal credit. The government’s own analysis showed the scheme was working, she said.The NAO defended its report, and noted that the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had signed it off, which is normally an acknowledgement that it agrees with its factual content. Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said: “This report was agreed by the department so we are surprised by the minister’s remarks. We stand by the facts in our report.”“Our analysis shows that universal credit is working we already know it helps more people into work – and stay in work – than the legacy system.”Universal credit was “a unique example of great British innovation” based on “leading edge technology”, she said, and countries such as New Zealand, Spain, France and Canada had come to “watch and learn” about the system.However, the NAO report appears to acknowledge the specific changes to universal credit policy cited by McVey, and notes that it received management data from the DWP as recently as May 2018. In some cases, the report concludes, it was too early to assess the impact of the most recent changes.The report notes that the DWP struggled to provide NAO staff with some of the information they requested “in a timely manner”, and failed to provide access to a survey of claimants’ experiences, which showed problems with payment timeliness.McVey insisted government claims that universal credit would help 200,000 people into work were robust, and had been signed off by the Treasury. The NAO report says this claim is unmeasurable, and that the DWP had accepted it could not prove it.Her Commons statement was met with incredulity by opposition MPs who cited widespread examples of vulnerable claimants being plunged into debt and rent arrears and left reliant on food banks, as a result of avoidable universal credit delays and errors.She added: “It is disgraceful that the government tried to rubbish the NAO report this morning and is still refusing to listen to those families who have been badly let down by their failed universal credit system.”McVey was supported in the chamber by Iain Duncan Smith, who oversaw the design and implementation of universal credit while in her role from 2010-16. He described the NAO report as a “shoddy piece of work”.Frank Field, the chair of the Commons work and pensions committee, said: “Rather than that banal offering, which did nothing for our poorest constituents, a more realistic statement from the secretary of state would have acknowledged that universal credit is helping to transform the welfare state from one which protects people from poverty, to one that drives them into destitution.”The NAO scrutinises public spending for parliament and is independent of the government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d2bf3a2bde95e3a4da612faa197bc6cbed94abf/0_35_2218_1331/master/2218.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42e2f2b2e58e64f8da923d16f3af7036","title":"lewis hamilton world cup boost french grand prix","story":"Lewis Hamilton has admitted Sunday’s World Cup match between England and Panama could be a distraction to his preparations for the French Grand Prix, which has itself been delayed to avoid a clash with the football.The British driver is a passionate England fan and said he will be watching the match but was optimistic that the side have every chance to ensure he starts the race buoyed after a victory.The start of qualifying and the race have been put back an hour to accommodate the 1pm kick-off times, with qualifying set to be finished on Saturday before Hamilton’s title rival Sebastian Vettel has the chance to see how Germany fare in their crucial match against Sweden. The British driver had a poor weekend at the last round in Canada, where his fifth place to Vettel’s win converted his 14-point championship lead to a single point deficit.He has his work cut out at the Paul Ricard circuit but said he would have to ide his attention. “It will be a little bit harder to focus on the race because we will be watching the game,” he said. “My engineers will be trying to keep an eye on both things at the same time, as will I.”He was also familiar with the endless optimism of England fans. “Whenever this tournament comes along you always are hoping for something special to happen for England,” he said. “In my lifetime it has not been great for us. We have a good group of boys, a good team.“I feel like I am very patriotic and am very proud to be a Brit. To be at the top of a sport and the one raising the flag – hopefully up against the German flag – it’s an honour and privilege.”The British driver also joined the chorus of approval for England’s Ashley Young, with whom he grew up in Stevenage. “I remember him being an awesome player as a kid,” he said. “To see his success and the ups and downs he’s had, his dream was always to play for England, he envisioned it and he is doing it.”Hamilton’s challenge in France may be tougher than expected with his Mercedes team set to reveal on Friday whether he will use a new engine at the race or a new engine that is upgraded. The upgraded version was rejected as not ready before Canada and if he takes the new unit but of the older specification it could be up to a tenth a lap slower than the upgraded engine Ferrari have employed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/227a0a1e29b42d985b7ec679f0fe64f3f8eceefa/0_621_4277_2566/master/4277.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=049cf70d2d4e55ea9db3953ec2db3d70","title":"nick kyrgios boiling point tense win kyle edmund","story":"Nick Kyrgios is playing the sort of lights-out grass‑court tennis that should put him in the conversation when Wimbledon starts on Monday week – if he can hold body and soul together. However, there was evidence here on Thursday that his temperament could yet strangle his genius.After pretty much serving Kyle Edmund out of the Fever-Tree championships in three sets, the gifted Australian first proclaimed the loser would be a “massive” threat at the All England Club, then turned on inquisitors who asked him about a burst of swearing at his box near the end of his 7-6 (3), 6-7 (5), 6-3 win on an otherwise pleasant, warm afternoon in west London.Then it got a little edgy. When asked about his apology to spectators after swearing loudly enough to be heard on the BBC, he said” “Do you swear? No, do you swear? Yes or no? Yes or no? Do you swear? Do you swear?”It will come as a shock only to some vicars and sheep minders in the Orkneys that journalists do actually swear.As for his tennis, Kyrgios’s serve is regularly red-lining around 140mph – even on second serve, occasionally – and he brought his tally of aces to 73 over a total of six hours and 42 minutes across six days, pinning Edmund behind the baseline for two hours and 11 minutes of that journey.When he brought Andy Murray’s comeback match to a conclusion over three sets in two hours and 39 minutes on Tuesday, a hip pain he has been carrying flared, and he conceded on Thursday: “I’m just managing my hip at the moment.” He added that his chronic elbow problem was “fine – that’s the most important thing”.Kyrgios’s British double followed an even more impressive performance in defeat in Stuttgart last Saturday when the world No\u0026nbsp1, Roger Federer, needed every ounce of his resilience in a third-set tie-break in the semi-final. Kyrgios next plays the defending champion, Feliciano López.There were no break points in the first 12 games but a couple of poor choices by Edmund and big serving by Kyrgios imperilled the world No\u0026nbsp17 in the tie-break. When Kyrgios – four places below him in the rankings – belted a winner from mid-court for set point, Edmund gambled with a net-charge – only to see a perfectly struck backhand fly past him.Edmund had to save his first break point at the start of the second. After a between-the-legs volley (that Edmund punished), Kyrgios held with a 137mph second serve. This was taking on the appearance of his match against Murray – but the Scot had kept the Australia’s ace count down to reasonable proportions (with 11 double faults, as he strove for the quick kill), demonstrating that his defensive game is still in excellent shape after an 11-month break from the Tour.After an hour on court on Thursday, Kyrgios had won the point from 30 of 31 first serves, thanks largely to 17 aces, a phenomenal strike rate. Edmund, ahead in the serving cycle, had to soak up the punches and wait for the counter off the ropes.He did a decent job of holding the shape of his own game until a lazy backhand handed Kyrgios another look in the ninth game. He hung on. Just.Edmund needed an eighth ace to save one of two break points, Kyrgios clocked up a couple of more aces and they went to a second tie-break where, this time, Edmund rediscovered his firepower and precision to level at a set apiece.An over-heated forehand cost the British No\u0026nbsp1 his serve in the fourth game of the decider and Kyrgios was back in control. Two more aces and he was 4-1 up. The match was his to lose. He grabbed match point with his final ace – and spluttered into familiar expletives when he pushed a forehand wide for deuce, then dumped a backhand.Edmund crashed to the turf trying to retrieve a drop shot on break point – but there was nothing he could do with Kyrgios’s concluding backhand passing shot down the line.Novak Djokovic remains in awesome form. He took just 65 minutes to beat the former champion and reigning ATP World Tour Finals title-holder Grigor Dimitrov 6-4, 6-1."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b6be11f3254929265b2b06176da7ff7e5baaa14/0_101_2064_1238/master/2064.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3e84d5655e79a794a48585303f682d3","title":"referees world rugby new zealand france clarity laws","story":"Steve Hansen was asked this week if he would consider putting the series trophy on the line for the All Blacks’ dead rubber against France on Saturday. The answer was unequivocal – “We’ve got it, so we’ll keep it” – while pointing out the decision is not his to make, but the very fact the question is being asked demonstrates the contentiousness of the series.On paper, New Zealand have won it with room to spare, scoring 52 points in the first Test before prevailing 26-13 in the second to take an unassailable 2-0 lead with the third to come in Dunedin, but the scorelines do not begin to tell the\u0026nbspstory.The first Test was 11-11 when France’s Paul Gabrillagues was shown an extremely harsh yellow card early in the second half and, to compound matters, the referee Luke Pearce awarded it without consulting the TMO. Soon afterwards, the France winger Rémy Grosso suffered a double skull fracture following practically simultaneous high tackles from Sam Cane and Ofa Tu’ungafasi – both All Blacks stayed on the pitch.In the second Test, with France 3-0 ahead and 12 minutes on the clock, Benjamin Fall was sent off for tackling the airborne Beauden Barrett, who landed on his head and had to be removed from the game. The red card has since been rescinded. All the while France’s sense of injustice is palpable.Both incidents have called into question World Rugby’s laws, the discrepancies between the referee’s interpretation and that of judicial panels, and even led to accusations of the All Blacks receiving preferential treatment. Indeed, the France prop Uini Atonio, born in Timaru and schooled in Auckland, on Tuesday suggested that to defeat the All Blacks, “you have to beat them 15 against 16”.Both incidents have to be taken in isolation but the unsatisfactory nature of how the first was dealt with aggravated the second. It took until three days after the first Test for World Rugby to release a statement to say Tu’ungafasi had been given a citing commissioner’s warning – the equivalent of a yellow card – highlighting mitigating factors including Grosso’s low body\u0026nbspposition.In the interim, World Rugby missed the opportunity to issue a proactive statement, instead referring enquiries to New Zealand Rugby (NZR), because, for reasons unclear, it is the host nation who oversees disciplinary matters. After Fall’s red card, meanwhile, it took less than three hours for NZR to announce Fall’s disciplinary hearing.At the hearing, the red card was rescinded because of mitigating factors – namely that Fall was nudged off balance by New Zealand’s Anton Lienert-Brown – and World Rugby issued a statement of clarification on Thursday, reaffirming the guidelines for yellow and red cards for challenges in the air. The Fall incident, however, would still appear to fall somewhere in\u0026nbspbetween.All the while World Rugby has done its best to absolve the referee, Angus Gardner, of blame, pointing out that, to the letter of the law, his decision to send Fall off was correct because the camera angles available to the judiciary panel which showed the mitigating factors (Lienert‑Brown’s nudge on Fall) were not available during the match. At the time Gardner could be heard stating he had “no option” but to send Fall off and it is hard not to sympathise with the Australian referee, not least because of World Rugby’s directives to clamp down on incidents that result in head injuries, not to mention the debate it has provoked.Amid the grey areas, however, one thing can be said with certainty. There are few less enviable tasks this weekend than that which awaits Saturday’s referee, John Lacey of Ireland, trophy on the line or not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de86c7ed4d5b2a06641fdf255164bcceb88006ef/0_7_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a25023da51f1004aba767e01c30aaf65","title":"england v australia fourth odi live","story":"32nd over: England 213-2 (Hales 18, Root 14) A very decent over from Neser until the last ball, which Root drives on the up for four, via Neser’s boot. If it was the Aussies’ day, that would have produced a run-out.Hales gets a nick to Neser and Paine puts it down. That was regulation, as Ricky Ponting says. Shades of David de Gea facing that shot from Ronaldo.31st over: England 206-2 (Hales 15, Root 10) Hales finally hits his stride, spotting Stonis’s even-slower ball and slamming it to the midwicket boundary. Even after this lull, the required rate is only five-and-a-half an over.30th over: England 198-2 (Hales 9, Root 8) Another proper over from Stanlake, who has decided to bin the Jake Dernbach impression and be Allan Donald instead.John Starbuck has a theory (there are some phrases that will work for all forms of cricket, and that’s one of them). “Re the switching round of bowlers by Tim Paine: could it be that he’s working to a plan of trying to upset the batsmen by so many changes, trying to unsettle them? I didn’t say it’s a good idea in this case.”29th over: England 197-2 (Hales 9, Root 7) England, who started by playing Twenty20, are now giving Test cricket a try. The upshot is that even Stoinis can bowl an over for two runs.In my experience, most of our correspondents on here are in Dubai, but John Tumbridge is at Chester-le-Street, just to the right of the scoreboard. “It’s now 7:50 on the longest etc,” he notes. “The sun is behind the clouds and there is still no need for floodlights.” Sir Ian Botham, who is Durham’s chairman, has been harrumphing about the cost. The fact that the lights are still shining may be a measure of his influence.28th over: England 195-2 (Hales 8, Root 6) Stanlake, emboldened by his wicket, finds some extra revs and raps Root on the glove before making him jack-knife out of the way of a bouncer. In between, Root nicks a couple of twos. And Paine has removed the lone slip, when Australia’s only hope lies in a good old English collapse. Here’s Andrew Benton. “A two-thirds Maiden would be a Maid, and a one-third Maiden would be your Ma. Bloomers.”27th over: England 191-2 (Hales 8, Root 2) Alex Hales gets away with a Harrow cut off Richardson, which duly goes for four. Why Lyon has been taken off is a mystery.26th over: England 185-2 (Hales 3, Root 1) Stanlake, who was awful in his first three overs, is suddenly unplayable, deceiving Bairstow and twice defeating Joe Root, who edges short of slip and then plays at thin air. Far from going for the role of allrounder, Root is now hoping to be considered as a specialist bowler.Ooh, maybe it’s game on after all. Bairstow tries to glide a slower ball from Stanlake and that’s a double triumph for Paine – a crisp catch and, at last, a successful bowling change. For Bairstow, 79 almost feels like par now.25th over: England 183-1 (Bairstow 79, Hales 2) Richardson keeps it to ones and twos, but that’s halfway and England only need another 128. Game off.24th over: England 176-1 (Bairstow 73, Hales 1) Ten off the over, but at least Lyon has the breakthrough, and the 18th wicket of his ODI career. It’s a funny old trio of games.An unwritten rule today says you’ve got to get out as soon as you reach three figures, so Roy plays a big mow and gets caught at third man. An ugly end to a sumptuous knock.Roy reaches his ton in the grand manner, lifting Lyon into the crowd. He’s an all-or-nothing cricketer, which is what you need at the top of a one-day order.23rd over: England 166-0 (Roy 94, Bairstow 71) Paine is standing up to Stoinis now, which means there can’t be a bouncer, so Bairstow is ready to seize on a slightly full one and whip it through midwicket.22nd over: England 159-0 (Roy 92, Bairstow 66) Another decent over from Lyon, which goes for three. Spin is the way to go today.Jonny Wilkins has a thought. “Why can’t Stokes just replace Wood, Plunkett or Willey? 3 seamers and 3 spinners (inc Root)?” He could, although Root has usually been the seventh bowler, not the sixth.21st over: England 156-0 (Roy 90, Bairstow 64) Stoinis is tonked to cow corner by Roy, who needed to take a pill at the end of the last over. Just think what he would have if he was feeling well.“I liked the question about what you call 23 maiden,” says Robin Hazlehurst, “but I’m not sure it is safe to answer on . A slightly fallen angel? It was only a kiss, honest? Yes I was a bit tipsy but we didn’t do that!? Probably better stop now before it’s too late.”20th over: England 146-0 (Roy 84, Bairstow 61) Lyon bowls the second-best over of the innings and has a fine shout for lbw, pinning Roy on the back pad with an off-break. Not out, says the ump, and although Hawkeye has it hitting, it would have been umpire’s call, so the Aussies are right not to review.“Can I be an old curmudgeon?” asks Chris Drew. If you’re that polite, I’m not sure you qualify. “I know this is filling grounds, and it’s great that there is a match in Chester-le-Street, but this is getting a bit tedious. I want something more entertaining, say like another Test against Pakistan. Yours in old curmudgeonness.” 19th over: England 143-0 (Roy 82, Bairstow 60) More ones and twos off Stoinis, who also bowls the first wide of the innings. And that’s drinks. I won’t insult you by saying who’s on top.A question instead: if you were Tim Paine, what would you do? Resign, or seek political asylum?While you’re thinking about that, we have an answer to my musings about what to call part-maidens. “OK,” says Agnes Soo, “if three dots balls is a half-maiden and four a two-thirds maiden, then six is an extra virgin over...”For a run-out, which may be the Aussies’ best hope... But it’s not out.18th over: England 134-0 (Roy 76, Bairstow 58) If in doubt, change the bowling. Paine removes Agar and reverts to Lyon, who almost beats Bairstow’s sweep, only to see an edge squirt away for four more.17th over: England 127-0 (Roy 74, Bairstow 53) Paine takes Stanlake off after one over and tries Stoinis, who at least steers clear of carnage, conceding a two and three singles. “Great commentary, Tim.” There’s no need for that, William Hargreaves, but thanks anyway. “I’d agree with your pre-innings comments that Aus v Eng always has ‘ticker’, and that even without the old foe identities there is always something to play for - even if just the ever-present averages rankings, tactics and positions in the team.” Is it enough, though?16th over: England 122-0 (Roy 72, Bairstow 50) Bairstow goes to yet another fifty, off 40 balls, which is almost sedate by his recent standards. Roy then reverse-sweeps Agar and gets four for it. The boundary count has reached 20, and even Agar has gone for ten off an over.15th over: England 112-0 (Roy 66, Bairstow 41) Paine doesn’t seem to have a clue what he’s doing, poor man. He recalls Stanlake, whose extra pace just makes it easy for Bairstow (a pull for four) and Roy (a miscued whip, also for four). Fewer than 200 to go. Do feel free to follow Argentina-Croatia with Scott Murray if you reckon it might be more exciting than this.14th over: England 103-0 (Roy 62, Bairstow 41) After working out how to milk Agar, Roy and Bairstow rack up yet another hundred partnership, off 80 balls. But even then Agar almost has Roy caught at deep mid-off, as he plays a loose chip onto the green. “Apropos nothing,” says Nigam Nuggehalli, promisingly, “481 is fantastic but we must remember it came against a team missing two of its best batsmen and three of its best bowlers. The real marker would be India in July when the English batsmen will face off against Yuzvendra Chawla and Kuldeep Yadav, the spinners who outfoxed South Africa on their turf. Looking forward to a great contest.” Fair point, though England were missing two first-teamers themselves – Stokes and Woakes. 13th over: England 97-0 (Roy 60, Bairstow 37) Facing Richardson, Bairstow plays a dreamy straight drive for four.And here’s Tom van der Gucht. “It was interesting watching Root bowl his full 10 overs today. With all the talk of Hales making way for Stokes, when he’s fit, due to his allrounder role, perhaps a conversation has occurred within the dressing room that the decision isn’t quite as straightforward. Maybe Root’s more pedestrian batting strike rate and Moeen’s inability to finish the innings has led to them being told that they too are in the firing line and have to fight it out with Stokes for two allrounder spots.... Pretty unlikely considering Root has our highest ODI average, but the top 3 combo of Bairstow, Roy and Hales is a terrifying prospect for opponents.” 12th over: England 90-0 (Roy 58, Bairstow 32) Agar is playing a different game from everyone else – a game that is not hopelessly one-sided. He keeps these two blasters to three singles, so he has gone for only two an over, while everyone else averages 8.6. He can bat too, and has a calm temperament. As Paine seems quite unsuited to one-day cricket, I’d make Agar captain.11th over: England 87-0 (Roy 56, Bairstow 31) Roy is seeing it so well that he can play a glide off Richardson through the vacant first slip for four. That was delicious, even if Ricky Ponting called it an edge. Roy has received 40 balls and sent ten of them to the boundary. Bairstow, not to be totally outdone, punches for four himself.10th over: England 76-0 (Roy 50, Bairstow 26) At last, a good over. Ashton Agar comes on as Paine suddenly remembers that Roy has a weakness against slow left-arm. Agar beats him, has that appeal for a stumping, finds some turn and only concedes a single, as Roy punches to longish-off. That brings up another riotous fifty, off 36 balls.“Which team will be more disappointed that Australia didn’t score 495?” wonders Robin Hazlehurst. “Australia because it is quite a lot of runs, or England because it would have given them a crack at the 500? Were Australia being deliberate spoilsports by losing those late wickets and not getting there? Will such comments come back to bite me on the bum later on? Have I just doomed us? Oh Hubris! So many questions...”For stumped against Roy, off Agar. Neat work from Paine but never out. 9th over: England 75-0 (Roy 49, Bairstow 26) That 15-run over has done for Neser. Jhye Richardson takes over and he too goes for four first ball as Bairstow spots something slightly short and flays it past cover. Only Stanlake has started with anything better than a four-ball. Richardson then manages four dots, or a 23 maiden (neologisms please), before offering a half-tracker which Bairstow flashes over short third man for four more. He has 26 off 20, which is a new twist on second fiddle. 8th over: England 67-0 (Roy 49, Bairstow 18) A whip for two off Lyon, followed by a rasping cut for four. Can someone please take a wicket?7th over: England 61-0 (Roy 43, Bairstow 13) Neser continues, and continues making the same mistake – straying onto the pads, once to each batsman, twice resulting in four. When Neser finally locates the off side, Roy cracks another four. He has 43 off 28 balls, and is showing that when you’re in top form, sport becomes dead simple.6th over: England 46-0 (Roy 33, Bairstow 18) Desperate Tims, desperate measures. Paine brings on Nathan Lyon, about five overs ahead of schedule. He fires in a dart, and Bairstow says thanks very much and cuts it for four.An email from John Tumbridge, at the ground. “It’s 6pm on the longest day of the year, the sun’s out, Roy is seeing the ball like it’s a beach ball. Why are the floodlights on?” Good question.5th over: England 38-0 (Roy 32, Bairstow 6) Neser keeps Roy quiet for a full three balls, before handing him a tuck for two. We need a word for that – the half-maiden, quite the triumph these days.4th over: England 35-0 (Roy 30, Bairstow 5) Roy hooks Stanlake and top-edges for the first six of the innings, before driving another four. Perhaps getting bored, he then invents a new stroke, the flap off the hip, and that goes for four too. Stanlake has gone for 2-0-26-0, and Paine ponders the most poisoned chalice since the Tories put Theresa May in Number 10.3rd over: England 21-0 (Roy 16, Bairstow 5) “Rich form?” mutters Bairstow. “Him?” So he blasts Neser through the covers for a boundary of his own. Not to be outclassed, Neser has a shout for lbw (inside edge, and maybe going down) and then finds the top of Bairstow’s bat as he tries an expansive cut. 2nd over: England 17-0 (Roy 16, Bairstow 1) Paine plays it straight at the other end, summoning Billy Stanlake. If the idea is to make Neser look good, it works, as Stanlake dishes up two half-volleys in the channel, and Roy punches them away for four either side of mid-off. He is in rich form.“Evening Tim.” Evening Damian Clarke. “I’m with you, in the summerhouse, drinking in the evening sun, and the Tempranillo. The new wine rack might have been a poor call. There is a good chance my wife will find me here in the morning, snoring gently with a battery dead laptop staring blankly at me.” That’s the spirit.1st over: England 5-0 (Roy 5, Bairstow 0) Tim Paine throws the new ball to Michael Neser, who starts with a gift – a gentle half-volley on the pads, with no fine leg. Jason Roy duly puts it out of its misery. Still, Neser, like several of this Aussie team, has a good beard, halfway from hipster to WG.Thanks Simon and evening everyone. Or should that be anyone? There is, it has to be said, not a lot riding on this. For the Aussies, there’s the chance of a bit of self-respect – which they’ve achieved by reaching 300. For England, it’s just one more step in what could be a first 5-0 rout of their old enemy. Most interesting development of the day so far: Joe Root, spotting that Alex Hales may have edged him out of the first-choice XI, sets about turning himself into an allrounder and rattles through ten tidy overs.I’m going to hand over to Tim de Lisle, who will take you through England’s reply. Bye!Ricky Ponting on Sky thinks “if you’d have offered that to the Australians after the toss, they would have taken it”, and that they have posted a very competitive total. I think he’s being a bit optimistic, but the Lyon effect could still make things interesting.According to The Cricket Prof on Twitter, Paine has played just 18 attacking shots in this series, which have brought 19 runs and seen him dismissed four times, giving him a dismissal rate of one wicket every 4.5 balls he attacks.50th over: Australia 310-8 (Richardson 5, Lyon 3) Lyon comes out and has a wild swing, the ball hitting the toe of the bat and looping into the air. It’s going nowhere near a fielder so Willey hares after it himself, arriving just a moment too late to claim a five-for. Still, his last two overs brought four wickets at the cost of nine runs, which isn’t too shabby.Paine heaves, misses and the umpire’s finger goes up instantly! That’s four wickets in eight balls for Willey!49th over: Australia 304-7 (Paine 3, Richardson 2) Wood bowls full and straight, and it works so well he keeps doing it. There’s one wide – his fifth delivery, another yorker, slides down the leg side – but two fresh batsmen can do nothing better than occasionally send the ball squirming away for a single, and Australia boost their total by a meagre four.48th over: Australia 299-7 (Paine 1, Richardson 0) Willey’s sixth over brings three runs, three dismissals and perhaps fatally undermines Australia’s efforts. Both of their centurions have been dismissed the very next ball after reaching 100.And another one! This one is short, wide, and Neser moves backwards to give himself room to nick through to the keeper!That’s great fielding! Marsh smashes the ball towards the boundary at long on, Roy catches it but his momentum is taking him over the rope so he throws it to Overton, running round from midwicket in support, whose job is simple! And Willey is on a hat-trick!It’s a low full toss that Carey lifts to deep midwicket, where Overton runs forward to take the catch!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64f4da3c9af00d90762fb87b61ed5baca9b490e0/1976_587_2512_1508/master/2512.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5543155ce53138ee0b7b82947b7d8ad5","title":"10 best uk picnic spots readers tips","story":"From bucolic Buckinghamshire to lochside beaches in the Highlands, our tipsters share their favourite spots for a summer picnicAs a child, the highlight of the holidays was spent running up and down “the humps and bumps”, as my brothers and I called the hillocks in Brill (13 miles west of Aylesbury), pulses racing, followed by a family picnic on a blanket. Sometimes we would picnic in the back of my parents’ old banger, excitedly peeling the shells off our boiled eggs as the rain slashed against the windows. How I would love to go back, though I’m not sure I could fly around the terrain with such speed any more. I wonder if the old windmill is still there ...Sarah de CostobadieWith its varied and breathtaking landscape, and plethora of birds and wildlife, it is easy to see why Cannock Chase has been named as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. There are lots of walks and cycle trails, as well as war memorials, museums and the remains of an iron age hill fort. There is a play area, too, so there’s plenty to keep everyone happy and to make for a lovely family day out – or several, in fact, as you wouldn’t cover everything in one trip or ever become bored of the place.Christine EvansPark at Lordenshawe and head up the steep climb. On your way, look out for red grouse and curlew. Once you get to the top, you’ll have worked up an appetite so find a smooth, warm rock and enjoy the panoramic view over the beautiful Northumberland countryside while you tuck in. Afterwards have a game of hide and seek in the rock formations. You can head home the way you came, or do a whole loop. Supplies can be picked up from superb Tully’s deli in Rothbury. User100331379First, visit Cashells deli on Crickhowell High Street for some scrumptious, locally produced picnic goodies, then wend your way down to the banks of the River Usk. The brave can indulge in some wild swimming (there’s a large, deep pool beneath the arched medieval bridge) but you can also paddle for miles along the path upriver, or sunbathe on the flat river rocks exposed during summer months. Wide, grassy acres on the Crickhowell side provide ideal conditions for frisbee or ball games, or you could just lie back and take in the stunning panorama of the Black Mountains.rja123There are picnic tables on the beach of Loch Lubnaig, a cabin selling hot and cold food made by two fantastically friendly ladies, spotless toilets and a campsite if you want to stay longer. This is a great stop if you’re driving to or from the Western Isles and a lovely introduction to the lochs on your way north.BikeSausageMy favourite spot is at the foot of the dam, especially in spring when the snowmelt tends to make the flow of water faster, louder and more mesmerising. The dam itself is protected by the Peak District hills and ancient woods. If you don’t fancy a blanket, there is a little picnic table area slightly south of the dam where, if you have any crumbs left, birds will perch on your hand and eat them. As for food, you are in the Peaks so stop by Bakewell on your way for a tart. Walk off the dessert by climbing up to the top of the dam.catchytitledAnywhere on, or overlooking, the four miles of soft sands and sheltered welcoming waters of Studland Bay is a great spot for a family picnic: it’s safe and traffic-free for children and pets, plus shallow bays make paddling easy and fun. Lovely meadows, kissed by ocean breezes, sweetly suggest afternoon strolls. The area inspired Enid Blyton’s Famous Five books. Stock up with pasties, bread and cheese for the picnic from the Dragons Village Bakery in Corfe Castle – with a few slices of their delicious Dorset apple cake to finish off the picnic.gallarateJust a short walk from Oxford’s museums and colleges is is Port Meadow, a vast and ancient area of pasture grazed by cattle and horses. This is the perfect place for a picnic. Either one that precedes a long walk among the ponies and Canada geese, or one that follows a cooling dip in the Thames. The best way to head there is to go up Binsey Lane. This way, you can go via the pick-your-own farm to stock up on fresh picnic supplies and pop into The Perch for the first drink.Finding a quiet spot in London’s parks can be a challenge in summer, but you can escape the crowds and work up an appetite by making your way to the very top of this park for a picnic in its peaceful flower garden. Pick up all you need from nearby Royal Hill – home to local gems The Cheeseboard (artisan cheeses) and The Creaky Shed (local, seasonal produce). Catch your breath under a towering cedar tree and enjoy lunch surrounded by exquisite floral displays, then wander through the woodland to visit the small herd of red and fallow deer.Susan BatesThe top of Butser Hill, in the South Downs national park, is a marvellous place for a picnic. Once you have parked at the bottom in Queen Elizabeth Country Park, and made the trek up to the top with kids and dogs, you have really earned your picnic, not to mention the fantastic views as far as the Isle of Wight.

The New Yorker called it “ponderous” and “preposterous”. The Hollywood Reporter called it “a big sprawling mess”.  gave it two stars.Which would normally be nothing to worry about, except for one thing. Yellowstone marks the big television debut of Kevin Costner, and you just know he expected more from it. When film stars cross over to television, they’re supposed to be unmitigated successes. Look at Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman in Big Little Lies. Look at Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey in True Detective. Anthony Hopkins in Westworld. Ewan McGregor in Fargo. Viola Davis in How to Get Away with Murder. Kevin Costner has won Oscars for acting and directing. He was once the biggest movie star in the world. You suspect that he wanted Yellowstone to be more adored than it actually is.But it’s fine. Not all film-to-TV transitions work out as they should. Here are some of Costner’s contemporaries who’ve similarly struggled to find success on the small screen.It wasn’t just that Gypsy was cancelled. It was that Netflix cancelled it in such an almighty hurry, just six weeks after it debuted. Some would argue that the cancellation came seven weeks too soon. A sexy thriller that lacked all trace of sexy thrillingness, Gypsy was as preposterous as it was boring. The whole thing was a tragic waste of Naomi Watts, especially given her career-best performance over on Twin Peaks: The Return that same year.Every actor in Hollywood saw what True Detective did for the careers of Harrelson and McConaughey, but Vince Vaughn was the one unlucky enough to actually get cast in its sequel. The second season was a profound disappointment, baffling and rushed and unfocused, and Vaughn came off worse than anyone. What could have been a defining moment in his career became a brand new low, thanks in part to the ridiculous monologue he delivered to a stain in the second episode.This could have been so great. Created by David E Kelly, The Crazy Ones was set to be Robin Williams’ big return to TV comedy after a three-decade absence. But something about it just didn’t work. The single-camera set-up and lack of studio audience left Williams projecting into a void, which gave the show a feeling of unintentional spookiness, and viewers fled in their millions. An upsetting way for such a spectacular career to end.If you never got the feeling that Billy Crystal loved Curb Your Enthusiasm, then this series was solid gold proof. In the FX show The Comedians, Billy Crystal played Billy Crystal pitching a show to FX, specifically to a character transparently based on FX’s real boss. If it had actually been funny, then Crystal might have just pulled off such a masturbatory premise. But it wasn’t, so he didn’t.Quick hands up: who knew there was a Jennifer Lopez cop show on TV? And who knew Ray Liotta was in it? That’s right, nobody. Shades of Blue is one of those weird network procedurals that appears to have been churned out overnight by a machine. Nothing is ever really that gripping. No boundaries are ever really pushed. It’s not clever or funny or sexy or good. And ratings have dropped off a cliff to such an extent that this year’s season has already been called its last. It will die unmourned by all.And now to the very worst film-to-TV transition in all of history. It wasn’t that Amazon’s Crisis in Six Scenes gave us an imperfect version of Woody Allen, because Woody Allen has already been giving us an imperfect version of Woody Allen for the last 25 years. No, it was that Crisis in Six Scenes was such a precipitous drop-off in quality – badly written, badly shot, badly paced, badly acted – that it made you long for dreck like Cassandra’s Dream, because at least that had the good grace to be relatively short. After he’d signed up to make it, Allen said “It was a catastrophic mistake. I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m floundering. I expect this to be a cosmic embarrassment”. At least he was right about that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/186e872a6c0a6898d98c4be36796907ff23c708f/0_6_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f03564063cfc1c9b4003dd538cdef015","title":"the list 34361 men women and children who perished trying to reach europe world refugee day","story":"Since 1993, one group has kept a tally of all the migrants and refugees who died trying to reach Europe. To mark World Refugee Day, we look at what it tells us about the defining crisis of our timesToday, on World Refugee Day, the  is distributing a list of the 34,361 migrants and refugees known to have died attempting to find a new home within the borders of the European Union.It has been compiled by United for Intercultural Action, a European network of 550 anti-racist organisations in 48 countries. The List stretches back to 1993, when Kimpua Nsimba, a 24-year-old refugee from Zaire, was found hanged in a detention centre, five days after arriving in the UK.The List only details refugees whose deaths have been reported: the toll is almost certainly far higher than 34,361. As international media coverage of the refugee crisis has taught us, many more deaths go undocumented. Migrants are lost at sea, or die in the backs of trucks they are killed in perilous conditions in camps, or by far-right hate groups or the extreme stress of their situation leads them to take their own lives. Istanbul-based artist Banu Cennetoğlu, whose work explores the way knowledge is collated and distributed, and its subsequent effect on society, has worked with the List since 2002. Since 1993, activists at the network United for Intercultural Action have made a record of every reported instance in which someone has died trying to migrate into Europe. In all, 61 deaths were recorded in 1993 3,915 were recorded in 2017.The small team, based in the Netherlands, drew on reports in the local, national and international press, as well as NGO records. Though the vast majority of people died during en route for Europe – most of them at sea - the List also points out that hundreds died in custody, and hundreds more took their own lives. Most deaths recorded on the List are anonymous. As of 5 May 2018, the figure stood at 34,361. But activists acknowledge that the List is neither definitive nor comprehensive. The real number is likely to be far higher, as many thousands of people will have died without trace during sea and land journeys over the years.With work on the Windrush scandal and the award-winning New Arrivals series, the  has demonstrated its commitment to exposing the social injustice faced by refugees and migrants. On Wednesday June 20, the  becomes the first English-language daily to publish the List in full. It is also available as a PDF download on our website. This edition of The List is produced by Chisenhale Gallery, London and Liverpool Biennial.Among other places, she has put it on bus stops in Basel, Switzerland billboards in Amsterdam a wall in Los Angeles advertising columns in Berlin and a public screen on top of Istanbul’s Marmara Pera hotel. This is the first time the List has appeared as a supplement in an English-language newspaper it is also available from today as a downloadable PDF on the ’s website.The List is not an artwork in itself – the art lies in its dissemination. Cennetoğlu always ensures that the look of the list remains the same – a grid of data, showing the year, the name of the refugee, where he or she came from, the cause of the death and the source.The most recent version of the List was finished on 5 May 2018. Other material has been produced by  journalists, using the List as a source, to report on how the shape of the refugee crisis has changed over the years.The List is a stark depiction of the scale of the refugee crisis and the human suffering it has caused over the past 25 years – misery that seems to have no end in sight.

So far no African country had agreed to host screening centres, he confirmed. “It has to be discussed with these countries, he said. “An official proposal has not been put on the table.”The idea for offshore migrant processing centres remains sketchy, with numerous political, practical and legal questions unanswered. It remains unclear, for example, whether migrants on a rescue ship in European waters could be returned to a north African country.Tahar Cherif, the Tunisian ambassador to the EU said: “The proposal was put to the head of our government a few months ago during a visit to Germany, it was also asked by Italy, and the answer is clear: no!“We have neither the capacity nor the means to organise these detention centres. We are already suffering a lot from what is happening in Libya, which has been the effect of European action.”He said his country was facing enough problems with unemployment, without wishing to add to them while Niger said its existing centres taking migrants out of detention camps in Libya are already full.The idea for the centres was thrown into the mix of EU migration policy before a series of crucial summits on migration in the next week.About 10 EU leaders will meet in Brussels on Sunday in a hastily convened emergency meeting aimed at preventing the collapse of the German coalition government.But the Italian government has been angered by draft conclusions for the summit, which stress the need to counter “secondary movements” – an issue that affects Germany. Under EU rules, a member state usually has responsibility for asylum seekers who have arrived in its territory, a regulation that has put frontline states Italy and Greece under huge pressure.But claimants often move to a second EU state, seeking a faster decision or to unite with family members.So-called “secondary movements” is the issue driving a wedge between Germany’s ruling coalition. The Bavarian CSU party has set the chancellor, Angela Merkel, a deadline of two weeks to find a solution. The interior minister, Horst Seehofer, has threatened to send away migrants at the border – a breach of EU rules that threatens to unravel the common asylum system.Tensions are running high after Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said he was not ready to discuss secondary movements “without having first tackled the emergency of ‘primary movements’ that Italy has ended up dealing with alone”.Italy’s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, said: “If anyone in the EU thinks Italy should keep being a landing point and refugee camp, they have misunderstood.”The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, reluctantly agreed to host the weekend summit to help Merkel, after her governing coalition came close to breaking point. Avramopoulos stressed that the summit would be about “consultations” to prepare the ground for decisions to be taken by all 28 EU leaders at a European council meeting next Thursday.Warning that the future of the EU’s border-free travel area was at stake, Avramopoulos said: “The European leadership of today will be held accountable in the eyes of future generations if we allow all these forces of populism to blow up what has been achieved”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc578a41d21d783f8f5f3601ae1600ad89a967b2/1147_93_2258_1355/master/2258.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acf05956d5e01bad8c8e819a1d7dcc5d","title":"from plates to piscine now macrons want a presidential pool","story":"French leader and his wife look into possibility of installing a pool at Fort de BrégançonEmmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, want to build a private swimming pool at the presidential summer retreat on the French Riviera.The president, whose tough economic measures and public spending cuts have led to strikes and street protests, and his wife have reportedly commissioned a study looking into the possibility of installing an above-ground pool at the Fort de Brégançon, which lies on a rocky island off the south of France. The study will examine building regulations at the site, which is classified as a historical monument, as well as technical questions.The site, yards from a private beach, is easily accessible to paparazzi long lenses and the prying eyes of holidaymakers. Previous presidents have been captured in their bathing costumes and it is alleged Jacques Chirac was snapped standing naked in front of a bedroom window at the fort.The exact cost of installing a pool has not been determined, but the Élysée has reported that the initial quotes were up to €150,000. The cost is expected to be met from public funds. The Macrons are said to be keen to have the pool ready for this summer. Fort de Brégançon has been the presidential holiday retreat since Charles de Gaulle first stayed there in the 1960s. It is known to require some updating in terms of decoration. Macron has already asked for some refurbishments and maintenance work to be carried out.

Photograph: Cyril Byrne The chair of Ireland’s Citizens’ Assembly has said other countries should seek to emulates the model in deliberations on important issues.Ms Justice Mary Laffoy said Ireland was now only the county in the world where two changes to the constitution resulted from the deliberations of citizens. She was referring to the Constitutional Convention which in 2014 recommended a referendum on same-sex marriage which was passed in May 2015 by 69 per cent to 32 per cent and the fact that in April 2017 the Citizens’ Assembly recommended that the Eighth Amendment on abortion should be removed from the constitution. The assembly was criticised by anti-abortion campaigners who accused it of being biased in favour of repeal of the Eighth Amendment. Anti-abortion campaigners also claimed the make-up of the 99 members of the assembly was unrepresentative of the country at large but its final outcome mirrored that of the referendum. Some 64 per cent of the members of the assembly voted for abortion without restriction up to 12 weeks. In the referendum last month, 66 per cent of the population voted to repeal the Eighth Amendment in the knowledge that the Government intended to introduce legislation which would allow for abortion up to 12 weeks on request.In her concluding remarks about the assembly on Thursday, Ms Justice Laffoy described both exercises in deliberative democracy as a “unique and novel process”. “It is hoped that they will be of benefit not only to the political system, but to others involved in exercises such as those in other jurisdictions,” she said. Ms Justice Laffoy praised the members of the assembly who stuck with the process from the beginning to end. The assembly lasted 18 months and considered five subjects: abortion, climate change, Ireland’s ageing population, how referendums are conducted and fixed term parliaments. The judge said she had been “astounded by their commitment, energy, openness and hard work. “Members continued to willingly give up their weekends and worked hard to ensure that they understood the issues before making carefully considered, informed recommendations. “All members have embodied the spirit of the assembly since they joined with no exceptions. They have been alive to the key principles of the assembly at all times - openness, fairness, equality of voice, efficiency, respect and collegiality. I have found their level of commitment to public service over the last 18 months extraordinary.”On the issue of future referendums, 94 per cent said there should be a permanent referendum commission. They also voted overwhelmingly that the Oireachtas should develop and effectively limit spending in referendums. In respect of multi-option voting in a constitutional referendum 76 per cent voted that it should be permissible to have more than two options on a ballot paper in a constitutional referendum - the so-called preferendum. The members also voted by a narrow majority (51 per cent) in favour of a changes to the current constitutional position on the dissolution of the Dáil. This would allow for fixed-terms parliaments such those that operate in the UK.

Nearly three-quarters – 74 per cent – come from small businesses.Businesses located along the Border are more likely to be involved in cross-Border trade than those situated further away, according to the report’s authors whose work has shed greater light on the trade taking place.However, the study so far offers only a “partial picture”, as Northern Ireland businesses rely heavily on moving and receiving goods through ports in the Republic for its trade with Great Britain.“North-South supply chains cannot be considered in isolation from trade with Great Britain and this remains an area for further research,” the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency report said.The figures have come as no surprise to businesses on the Border, for whom the report underlines the potentially catastrophic impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland’s economy.Most cross-Border trade is carried out by small and medium-sized businesses, which could be jeopardised by customs and origin certification rules, according to Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI.“With 750,000 business transactions from business to business from North to South, if Northern Ireland is outside the EU, we run the risk of needing origin certificates for all those trade transactions.“That could potentially add hundreds of thousands of pounds of costs onto the manufacturing sector, particularly for smaller firms, which could potentially create a crisis in the manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland.“While there would be the same implication for goods going in the opposite direction, obviously the impact wouldn’t be as severe,” he said.The official statistics highlighted the threat posed by Brexit to Northern Ireland, said Gavin Killeen, managing director of Derry-based company Nuprint, which supplies labels and packaging for food and drink companies across the island.“The Republic is one of the most economically advanced economies in Europe, whereas the Northern Ireland economy has been stagnant for a number of years. “If you were an ambitious company which wanted to grow and to create, you traded with the Republic. The reality is the economy in the Republic will be well able to continue even if there is a hard border. “Whereas in Northern Ireland, which already hasn’t got much going for it economically – a stagnant economy which isn’t growing, and no government – any hard border has the potential for a significant impact,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3538844.1529600650!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"juncker accepts there may be no deal with uk on brexit","story":"Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, addresses the joint houses of the Oireachtas. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker addresses a joint sitting of the Dáil  and Seanad. The European Union must prepare for the possibility of failing to reach a deal on Brexit, European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker has said. Addressing a joint sitting of the Dáil and Seanad , the former prime minister of Luxembourg said that “as the clock to Brexit ticks down, we must prepare for every eventuality, including no deal”.“This is neither a desired nor a likely outcome, but it is not an impossible one and we are getting ready just in case,” he said. Mr Juncker said it was in everybody’s interest for the UK and the EU to stay as close as possible and to be friends, partners and allies. “The reality is there is no arrangement outside the European Union which is as good as membership,” he added. He said a pragmatic approach would be taken to finding solutions. “But I also want to be clear, Ireland will come first,’’ he said. Mr Juncker said those who thought the other 26 countries would abandon Ireland for a deal that suited them did not understand what being part of the union was. To applause, he said Ireland’s Border was the union’s priority. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the greatest challenge Ireland faced was to “solve the riddle of Brexit”. He said the Government was “deeply grateful for the remarkable solidarity and support we have received from the EU institutions and fellow member states, none more so than from president Juncker”.Mr Varadkar also paid tribute to the “diligence and understanding shown by the Commission’s lead negotiator Michel Barnier”, who travelled to Dublin with Mr Juncker.The Taoiseach, referring to the particular challenges faced by Ireland with Brexit, said “the backstop for the Irish Border, agreed in December, must be legally operative in the withdrawal agreement to apply ‘unless and until’ an alternative solution is agreed”.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said “there is a considerable and growing unease about the failure to move from generalities to concrete and final agreements in the negotiations”. “The simple fact today is that London may actually never come up with a credible proposal,” he warned. Mr Martin said “we are extremely concerned with how negotiations on the Irish text have now been linked with the overall withdrawal treaty text and its provisions for final status negotiations”.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said British prime minister Theresa May had “set out a policy of Ireland last, if at all.”She said “we are most disappointed that, despite an assurance that the Irish question would be answered in advance of setting out the details of the new relationship that Britain wishes to foster with the EU, this has not happened”.Ms McDonald said “in the absence of the British demonstrating how they would avoid a hard border, uphold the Good Friday Agreement and protect citizens’ rights, it is reckless to allow talks to progress to the next phase.”She appealed to Mr Juncker and Mr Barnier “not to make this mistake”.Ms McDonald said “I hope the EU does not blink and fulfils this mission” of “Ireland first and Ireland now”.Mr Juncker intervened in response to People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett, who asked if Ireland could trust him “with our Border or the interests of the people in this country”.Mr Boyd Barrett said “we do not trust the Tories. Can we trust you?” to which the Commission president replied “yes”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Used by Charles de Gaulle and successive presidents, it had fallen out of favour of late - notably because its private beach is easy prey for paparazzi from the sea.François Hollande, Mr Macron’s predecessor, stopped using Brégançon after he and then-girlfriend Valérie Trierweiler were snapped in their swimwear. She sued French media for invasion of privacy after reportedly complaining the photos made the presidential couple “look fat”.Mr Macron, who wants to turn Brégançon into a French Camp David for summer meetings with foreign dignitaries, had already ordered the fort to be upholstered with a new kitchen.Emmanuel Macron wants to turn the old Riviera fort of Brégançon into a Gallic Camp DavidNow he wants a swimming pool to avoid, say Elysée sources, paparazzi prying on the president, his wife Brigitte, and her three children. Due to the expense of digging a hole in the fort’s rocky grounds, he has opted for an aboveground pool, with presidential aides saying the estimated €15,000 (£13,000) cost will come from the retreat’s €150,000 annual maintenance budget.However, the opposition slammed the move as insensitive at time when Mr Macron’s government is reducing housing allowance for the poor and days after he was filmed complaining about the “crazy amounts of dosh” France pumps into welfare benefits that trap some people in a cycle of poverty.Regularly forced to deny claims is “the president of the rich”, Mr Macron, 40, came under fire last week over reports the Elysée had spent around €500,000 on new crockery for the presidential palace. He came in for yet more flak over reports he had taken a costly private Falcon jet to travel just 110 km.France\u0026#39s ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy visited the fort de Brégançon but later preferred her luxury retreat in neary Cap NègreReacting to news of the pool, Olivier Faure, head of the French Socialist Party, said it constituted a “cruel symbol”.Mr Macron, he said, “further whittles away housing benefit for the poor and at the time time builds a swimming pool in Brégançon fort. His pool will be offshore, like his politics.”On the Right, Lydia Guirous, spokeswoman for the Republicans, stuck in the knife saying: “The president’s profligate behaviour is shocking at a time when he is asking ever more efforts from the French.”The pool is by no means the first time opposition feathers have been ruffled over the cost of presidential perks.Predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy sparked howls of complaint after it transpired he had spent €75,000 on two ovens for his presidential plane, dubbed Air Sarko One.Please review our commenting policyComment: It\u0026#39s quite possible for social media firms to protect children.

Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the legendary gathering, which brought Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Janis Joplin and Joe Cocker together for one of the defining musical events of the 1960s. In advance of the celebrations, a team from Binghamton University\u0027s public archaeology facility was enlisted to help map out precisely where the festival unfolded.The overall point of this investigation is to kind of define the stage space, said Josh Anderson, the project director, kneeling beside a hole that showed evidence of a fence that kept 400,000 fans from the stage area.We can use this as a reference point, he said. People can stand on that and look up at the hill and say, \u0027Oh, this is where the performers were. Jimi Hendrix stood here and played his guitar at 8:30 in the morning.\u0027Artifacts dug up from the Woodstock siteThe five-day excavation did unearth some artifacts: parts of old aluminium can pull tabs, bits of broken bottle glass. The artifacts will be analysed and mapped for depth and location - the pull tab parts are useful since they suggest where the surface level was at the time of the concert.The main point of the survey was to get a clear understanding of the layout of Max Yasgur\u0027s old farm - which is already on the National Register of Historic Places.The hillside has been preserved since the late 1990s by a charity that runs an adjacent \u002760s-themed museum, complete with a psychedelic bus.This is a significant historic site in American culture, one of the few peaceful events that gets commemorated from the 1960s, said Wade Lawrence, director of The Museum at Bethel Woods. He told AP that the archaeologists\u0027 work will help the museum plan interpretive walking routes in time for the concert\u0027s 50th anniversary next year.“Bethel Woods would like to recreate the experience of the main concert stage from the 1969 festival,” the museum’s website states. “This includes the performer’s bridge over West Shore Road, the speaker towers, and fencing around the main stage in addition to footers or other evidence of the actual stage.”Mr Lawrence said aerial shots taken during the August weekend cannot be relied upon to show the exact location of the \u002769 stage and light and speaker towers.Paul Brown working on the Woodstock siteOn-site data helps, though the bottom of the hillside was re-graded in the late \u002790s to accommodate a temporary stage for anniversary performances.The spot of the original stage is under a layer of compacted soil, brought in for the concerts.However, archaeologists now think they have found the spot where a chain-link fence on the side of the stage area met the wooden Peace Fence that ran in front of the stage. Now they can match concert photos to a specific spot in the field.

Abi Oladimeji, chief investment officer at Thomas Miller Investment, said weak data coming from various economies including the UK and eurozone gave rise to doubt about “the extent to which the sharp slowdown in the first quarter was weather-related and therefore, transitory”.“Economic uncertainty and political upheaval could encourage the European Central Bank to keep its options open and refrain from a premature end to monetary stimulus,” he added. “Likewise, the Bank of England may find it has much less scope to implement its stated plan of earlier and more frequent increases in interest rates.”Interest rate rise may put thousands at risk of mental health problemsInterest rate frozen again: what this means for youAJ Bell’s investment director Russ Mould said the central bank’s reluctance to move “may reflect lingering doubts over the underlying strength of the UK economy, which appears to be mired in another soft patch”.“This heaps more pain on savers as inflation continues to comfortably outstrip the meagre interest earned on their cash and real wage growth remains negligible,” he added.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Dedan\u0026nbspinscriptions. Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra.

When I did, one asked:\u0026nbsp“Can we pray for you?”I asked why they wanted to pray for me, and the same person answered that they felt called by God to walk the streets of DC\u0026nbspand let God’s voice tell them who might be “broken” or otherwise need prayer.As a Christian, I’m opposed to neither prayer nor people praying specifically for me, at least not when it’s done in good faith.But I’m also a transgender woman, and I was dressed in gorgeous makeup and clothing and earrings. I sure caught the gist of why these folks happened upon me to offer prayer.My introduction to Christianity was in evangelical churches. For years, I navigated conservative religious spaces, where I encountered bigotry and attempts to shame LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople and women as often as I found warmhearted people eager to serve others.There was more than a little racism, too. I’ve heard the statement “I’ll pray for you” said with love, and with judgment and scorn. I know the difference, and the folks who confronted me outside the cafe were making their judgement clear.Instead of a theological debate that usually goes nowhere for lack of good faith in discussion, I wanted them to feel what it’s like to have someone supposedly approach in love but inflict pain and discomfort. Perhaps that’s what it takes. A forced perspective in empathy. Why not try that approach?I could have ignored them but I’ve had it with some evangelicals giving a bad name to their community by insisting on defining people’s humanity for them. These three assumed I was broken because of my gender identity. They saw the constellation of my personhood through a backward telescope.It angered me that the whole of my being could be reduced to their flawed understanding of LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople, a view that could easily be revised if only they would take the time to get to know me instead of assuming they already did.So I would be damned if I would let them interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn’t bothering them.I asked their spokeswoman if she understood how it might look to be searching for “broken” people to pray for, and specifically pick out a random transgender person. And they looked more than taken aback.I stood up, smiling but internally annoyed, and asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. Their eyes went wide. One guy stammered nervously, clearly having trouble answering the question.The other two were just as flummoxed, ambushed by the idea that the “broken” transgender person was asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew.For those who don’t know, Matthew is the first book in the New Testament and one of the three Synoptic Gospels, each of which are narratives of the life of Christ, frequently using the same stories, often with identical wording.While all three contain instruction on prayer, I reached for Matthew 18:20 because of its strong presence in the evangelical community and its common misapplication by members. In short, it reads: “For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.”Those up on their biblical knowledge might wonder why I didn’t turn to Matthew 6:5-7, scathing verses that call out hypocrites who are performative in their Christianity, telling them to pray in private rather than out on the streets so that they might be seen by others.It’s a good one that, unsurprisingly, is ignored in evangelical circles. They know it’s there, but it’s inconvenient.The verse I selected hits hard instead because it’s so commonly heard before a group prayer in evangelical churches. There, it tends to be inaccurately interpreted as a numbers game, one that’s about bringing to fruition what is requested of God in prayer.Evangelicals think of it as a call to bring more people into the church or, more cynically, personal prosperity through the Gospel.In reality, it’s a verse on accountability before God and about how God may work that accountability through humans. As Leisa Baysinger notes on the blog Our Ancient Paths, it references earlier Jewish tradition that at least three witnesses must agree to bring judgement on someone.In the moment I was unaware of its exact roots, which were surprisingly apt given the attempt of this small band to sit in judgement of me, but I still understood what was at stake in the line, and I loved the idea of using a verse on accountability that they had probably misunderstood numerous times.I was the judged who understands the law better than those attempting to judge, and on that day I sought to bring accountability.These aren’t issues I take lightly, and the passive-aggressive condescension of these three was anything but harmless. This wasn’t the time to be polite.Not when the Trump-Pence White House is trying to ban transgender people from the military. Not when transgender students with stories of discrimination are turned away by the US\u0026nbspDepartment of Education.Not when President Donald Trump and vice president\u0026nbspMike Pence\u0026nbspare seeking to implement a Health and Human Services Department regulation allowing healthcare workers to deny potentially lifesaving treatment to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.Not when the Human Rights Campaign reports that in the US, eight transgender people have been killed in 2018 and 28 in 2017 –\u0026nbspthe most ever annually. I wasn’t going to be silent.Instead, I spoke.“You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus’ name, there he is with us?”They stared at me blankly. I had no intention of going easy on them.“That is what Matthew says, is it not?”At last, one spoke up: “Yes, that’s right.”And they nervously stepped forward into a circle.I said to one:\u0026nbsp“You start us off.” And she did, going through the motions quickly and antiseptically because they clearly wanted to get as far as they could from this awkward situation. And then I picked it up when it was clear she was done.“Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends,” I began, wholly honest with God about how I hoped she would bless my new friends, encouraging them to affirm and be inclusive of others. I was hopeful that their community would honour all as God made them and value the strength of ersity.I mentioned the natural beauty of the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and thanked God again for making us as we are, throwing in a genuine wish that their trip back home would be a safe one.Then, knowing my audience, I wrapped up with the usual evangelical banal phraseology –\u0026nbsp“no weapons shall be formed against them”,\u0026nbsp“put God on their hearts” –\u0026nbspto let them know I was just as familiar with their community’s vernacular as they were, maybe more so.As I finished, having returned their “let us pray for you” to them tenfold, they murmured their thank you’s and scuttled away.I don’t know whether my words made it through, but I hope they have a sense of what it feels like to have a stranger impose self-righteous venom on them. I also hope that they’ll realise how much actions such as these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.A prayer that one might change their sexuality or gender identity is egregious encouragement to those who would seek to discriminate against LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople in our laws and to do violence against them in our communities. My own prayer’s acidity served to make them aware of their own by way of spiritual inoculation.The Genderquake debate did more harm than good for transgender peopleWhy has Caitlyn Jenner been chosen to speak about ‘ersity’?These people did not want to know more about me. They wanted to talk at me and pray at me. And I’m confident that’s not how Jesus would go about it.There are many in the evangelical community who love and affirm their LGBT+\u0026nbspfamily, friends and fellow human beings.It’s unfortunate, then, that others in the community still must be told a simple truth: They are not doing the Lord’s work by politicising prayer at the expense of others or by dumping their misplaced condescension on strangers they believe to be broken.Prayer should be a loving act, not a weapon of marginalisation.Clymer ia a transgender woman,\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspArmy veteran and\u0026nbsppress secretary at the Human Rights Campaign\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But its implications are huge, and therefore have never been tested fully.Despite that, scientists rely on it to explain the strange behaviour of our universe. The new study shows that they haven\u0027t been wrong to do so.For instance, scientists have known since 1929 that the universe is expanding, but in 1998 found that the expansion had sped up and was going more quickly than it did in the past. That can only make sense if the universe is filled with a mysterious substance called dark energy – but that in turn relies on GR being correct at the scale of galaxies.As such, our very understanding of the universe relies on GR being correct.To check that, a team of astronomers looked deep into space, using\u0026nbspa nearby galaxy as a gravitational lens. That allowed them to test gravity at the astronomical scale.General Relativity predicts that massive objects deform space-time, this means that when light passes near another galaxy the light\u0027s path is deflected, said\u0026nbspThomas Collett of the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth, who led the study.\u0026nbspIf two galaxies are aligned along our line of sight this can give rise to a phenomenon, called strong gravitational lensing, where we see multiple images of the background galaxy.If we know the mass of the foreground galaxy, then the amount of separation between the multiple images tells us if General Relativity is the correct theory of gravity on galactic scales.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The ancient grave also contained the skeletons of leopards, lynx,\u0026nbspbears, cranes and domestic animals.The creatures interred in the\u0026nbsptomb are thought to\u0026nbsphave belonged to Lady Xia, grandmother of the nation’s first emperor, Qin Shi Huang.Naming their find Junzi imperialis, the scientists said the discovery is particularly noteworthy given the total lack of gibbons in the region today.Dr Samuel Turvey, a conservation biologist at the Zoological Society of London who made the discovery, told Science magazine that accounts of gibbons in central China are confined to the history books.“It is very, very far from any gibbon populations today,” he said.Dr Turvey came across the gibbon remains, which were first unearthed in 2004, while visiting the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archaeology in Xi’an.British mammals’ fight for survivalThe Mammal Society’s assessment of Britain’s mammal populations is the first such review in over 20 years. The results reveal winners and losers, and highlight some of the key threat’s facing the country’s wildlife such as habitat loss, invasive species and the spread of diseases.Only one of these flying mammals has been recorded in the whole country, in a railway tunnel in West SussexThough not generally considered threatened animals, black rats number have collapsed in recent years due largely to pest control measures. However their far more common cousins, the brown rats, are thriving.Though it is difficult to measure changes in squirrel numbers,  their range has shrunk considerably due largely to the spread of squirrel pox virus by invasive grey squirrelThere has been a marked decline in wildcat populations, with only around 200 left in ScotlandThe banning of persistent organic pesticides has had a positive population effect on ottersThe 2018 review estimates a population size of fallow deer almost three times the size of that estimated in the 1995 review – a positive trend that is seen in other deer species.These aquatic mammals were nearly extinct in Europe at the start of the 20th century, but their reintroduction to the UK have been largely successfulThe Mammal Society’s assessment of Britain’s mammal populations is the first such review in over 20 years.

Its discovery was documented in the journal Science.Dr Thomas Geissmann, a gibbon expert at the University of Zurich, said the skull is a “fantastic find”, and could be the first evidence of many more gibbon species that used to inhabit this part of China.“I don’t doubt for a second that it’s a new species, and probably a new genus,” he said.Historical accounts and artwork from ancient China are full of references to gibbons, and could help scientists understand what the ape looked like when it was alive.Despite the reverence the ancient Chinese gave to these primates, it is likely that human expansion into the region’s expansive forests during this period spelled the end for its gibbon inhabitants.As forests are felled and agriculture expands, the gibbons’ habitat was probably whittled away, and the onset of a cooler, drier climate in central China at this time could have added to the pressure on its apes.Similar pressures still face gibbons today. In China, two species of these primates have disappeared recently, and the surviving representatives of the group are critically endangered.Scientists have warned that around 60 per cent of all primate species globally are threatened with extinction, including chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans.The Hainan gibbon, which inhabits the Chinese island it takes its name from, may be the rarest mammal in the world – with only around 26 iniduals remaining. The pressures facing these apes are similar to those that seemingly faced their ancient central Chinese cousins – human activity and habitat destruction.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The result will be a tailor-made system based on the inidual.“This is a unique example of great British innovation and we are leading the world in developing this kind of person-centred system. Countries like New Zealand, Spain, France and Canada have met with us to see universal credit to watch and learn what is happening for the next generation of benefit system.”Referring to the NAO report, Ms McVey said it did not take into account the government’s recent changes to universal credit.“Our analysis shows that universal credit is working,” she said. “We already know it helps more people into work and stay in work than the legacy system.“Once fully rolled out it will be a single streamlined system, reducing administration costs and provide value for money for all our citizens.”But Margaret Greenwood, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the NAO report into the government’s flagship welfare system was “damning” and described universal credit\u0026nbspas a “major failing of public policy”.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesRevellers watch the sunrise as they celebrate the pagan festival of Summer Solstice at Stonehenge in Wiltshire.

However, this doesn\u0027t answer the wider question about whether sourcing EU talent will still be a viable option in the future.\u0026ldquoThe drip feed of information about immigration policy has gone on for too long.

I haven\u0027t started packing yet.

Standing order 24B says that the speaker may not accept amendments is a motion is put down in neutral terms.\u0026ldquoNow, the standing orders of the House can be changed, the speaker can rule in a particular way, but the key is that the legislation says that the motion must be in neutral terms.\u0026ldquoSo if parliament passes a different motion, that doesn\u0026rsquot meet the requirements of the legislation.9.25am UPDATE: Former Brexit minister David Jones has dismissed as \u0026ldquoextraordinary proposals that would require Britons to get a visa to travel in Europe.He said: \u0026ldquoMany third countries enjoy visa-free access to the EU and given the UK\u0026rsquos historical links, one would not expect the EU to adopt such an apparently perverse position.The plans feature on a lengthy list of amendments to laws and regulations in a Brexit document presented by the Commission\u0026rsquos powerful Secretary-General Martin Selmayr to MEPs on the Parliament\u0026rsquos Brexit Steering Group.The Irish border issue remains a major sticking point in Brexit talksq8.55AM UPDATE:\u0026nbspIreland\u0027s deputy premier Simon Coveney has warned the UK there will be no withdrawal deal without an agreement on the Irish border.Mr Coveney said the prospect of a no-deal scenario was being contemplated within the EU.He said the EU was standing firmly behind Ireland and its demand for legally binding assurances from the UK to ensure no return to a hard border on the island.Mr Coveney said: \u0026ldquoWe have been reassured over and over again that Ireland will not be left isolated here.Let\u0027s be very clear - there will be no withdrawal agreement, no transition agreement and no managed Brexit if the UK don\u0027t follow through on their commitments.8.30am UPDATE:\u0026nbspMr Varadkar said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom very much looking forward to President Juncker\u0026rsquos first visit to Ireland as Commission President.\u0026ldquoI will thank President Juncker and Michel Barnier for their ongoing support for Ireland and their show of solidarity throughout the Brexit negotiations.\u0026ldquoThis is an important opportunity to assess the state of play in the Brexit negotiations.On the border issue, Mr Varadkar said: \u0026ldquoWe need to see much more progress from the UK to implement the commitments they made in December and March, and I expect the UK\u0026rsquos efforts to intensify in the period ahead.\u0026ldquoPresident Juncker and I are both very committed to the European project and the benefits that it brings to citizens across the Union.\u0026ldquoWe will also discuss other key items on the agenda of next week\u0026rsquos meeting of the European Council such as trade, ensuring a stable euro, and equipping the Union with a budget for its future needs."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/John-Walton-977648.jpg","title":"blitz bomb bravery medals john walton disposal expert","story":"BNPSLieutenant John Walton\u0027s medalsHe was awarded the prestigious George Medal for displaying \u0027deliberate and cold-blooded courage of the highest order\u0027 defusing bombs at a gasworks in Romford, Essex, in November 1940 and a cement factory in Purfleet, Essex, in March 1941.On one occasion, he dealt with four 500lb bombs at a gas works in the space of 24 hours where there was so little oxygen in the air he could only work for 20 minutes at a time.During a particularly busy spell he disarmed 21 bombs in two weeks, putting his life on the line each time as others hid in the air shelters.Tragically, he was blow up while attempting to defuse a \u0027Balloon Bomb\u0027 at Halfway House Marches near Great Wakering, Essex, on April 1, 1942.He was aged 32.

Israel, America, the Tories and Brexit the next.Corbyn’s off limits, obviously, as Frankie thinks he’s “a real person”, but there’s a regular cast of soft targets, including Donald Trump, Richard Branson (“a c***”), Boris, Michael Gove, Ruth Davidson (“a bastard”) and usually a joke about Prince Philip dying, which I think we can put down to the host’s very obvious and well-deserved self-loathing.Prince Philip, after all, was mentioned in dispatches fighting real Nazis in World War Two, instead of just ranting about them to a couple of hundred students at the Edinburgh Fringe.At the age of 97, The Duke is also still a thousand times more unpredictable, off-message, edgy and funny than any of the people on NWO and, unlike Frankie, who has 11 scriptwriters, also comes up with his own material.The hatred and abuse of Israel is slightly harder to explain, though. Frankie claims it’s because “They break international law”, but then so do a lot of countries, including Russia, which even shoots down passenger aircraft.A stroke of luck then, you might think, that the BBC’s just screened Frankie’s two-part, pre-World Cup travelogue, Frankie Goes To Russia, where, unfortunately, he didn’t have time to raise the issue of the aircraft, but he did go on Moscow radio to denounce the British Empire (topical or what!).If you were expecting anything else, of course, you give Frankie Boyle more credit than his apparent cowardice and hypocrisy deserves.If you were also expecting laughter, then I applaud your optimism, but you’ll no more get it on NWO than on Have I Got News For You, or The Mash Report, or any of those other shows that have decided the right-on part of the world is untouchable and their own left-wing agenda is far more important than being funny.The BBC’s continuing claims of impartiality, on the other hand? Well, forgive me if I let out the hollowest laugh of my life, but they are really, darkly funny.Ha . . .— GIVEN the BBC’s endless, self-serving and grovelling tributes to the NHS are still very much ongoing, I feel it would be wrong, at this point, if I didn’t join in the birthday celebrations.For though it has its faults and is often criticised, it’s been there for us, healing the lame, curing the sick, becoming the envy of the world, a shining beacon to the entire universe, which makes me fall to my knees and give thanks for seven decades’ service at the mere mention of its sacred initials.Happy 71st, Bupa.All those liars who say they want fat, unattractive people on Love Island. The disturbing Trouble With Women revelation that Anne Robinson keeps a scrapbook of her old newspaper columns, when so many hamsters still go without decent bedding every night.And The X Factor giving a job not just to Robbie Williams, who’s won 18 Brit awards and five Ivor Novello awards, but also his wife, Ayda Field, who handed Emmerdale the NTA’s 2017 Best Soap award. There on merit . . .IF you have ever wondered why some people are so dementedly pleased to see the World Cup arrive, try watching daytime TV just before the ball-kicking tournament starts.I did last Wednesday and quickly fell down a QVC rabbit hole, where I discovered Amanda Holden has a neat line in selling stuff nobody actually needs but everyone seems to want.Suitcases that aren’t really suitcases, string chairs designed to look like a cat’s sphincter, rugs that would make a Moroccan fez salesman blush, machine-woven toilet roll baskets, lamp-shades so taut and expressionless they could sit on the Britain’s Got Talent panel, if you just pre-programmed them with a dirty laugh.Amanda’s exclusive landfill range has the lot. Piece de resistance, though, has to be her “glass infinity spheres”, which defy any sort of purpose or description, but she had a crack anyway.“They’re, uhm, a bit like those things in the ’80s and ’90s you put fingers and hands on.”Lava lamps? Tamagotchis? Les Dennis? Sadly, we may never know.The afternoon’s real curve ball, though, was introduced by QVC’s endlessly enthusiastic host Pipa Gordon, vis-a-vis lightbulbs: “Amanda, bayonet or screw?”Get back to you, Pipa. I’m just emailing a format idea to ITVBe.Sophie and Sadie both switching their lights off the moment 5ive’s Ritchie Neville burst into song on a celebrity version of Take Me Out.The One Show’s Alex Jones telling David Walliams: “You’re handsome . . . in a different way.”And a dreadful opening to the World Cup being elevated by the brilliant Spain versus Ronaldo game, ITV’s superior selection of pundits and Wrighty, very solemnly assuring us: “I think Suarez has got a big one in him.”—TUESDAY, Good Morning Britain calls in the big diplomatic hitter to comment on the US/North Korea peace deal.Singer Michael Ball: “I would feel better if it wasn’t those two having the conversation.“But there is nothing better than people talking, ’cos . . . ”’Cos love, love changes everything. Hands and faces, earth and sky.AFTER a relatively slow start, Love Island is now in the groove and I am totally immersed. To such an extent that I developed a really strong loathing for a couple of the contestants last week.Namely, Eyal, who’s as ruthless and possessive as the next smirking little berk who claims he’s “spiritual”, and Hayley, a venomous little madam whose description of herself – “I’m cute, funny, feisty, dozy” – is a million miles away from anyone else’s, unless the Theatre Royal St Helens is seriously short of dwarves next Christmas.Fortunately, she’s gone now and there are quite a few of the Islanders that I do actually like.Stationery-obsessed Jack, who has Dancing On Ice 2019 written all over him, top secret Josh, who can’t say too much about his job (taps nose) and Laura, who, like every Scottish woman ever born, is incapable of disguising her feelings, good or bad, and has a biological clock that’s ticking like a Countdown Conundrum.It’s the production that still sets Love Island apart, though, and the fact it’s the only reality show which would drop Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony into the mix or have the wit to pay off the Alex/Eyal showdown with this news: “Megan had to choose between a man who saves lives with his bare hands and a boy who can walk up and down in a straight line while pouting.“There was only ever going to be one winner.”Brilliant television.Steve Wilson: “Portugal’s big man in the sky is on the pitch.”Alex Scott: “Croatia looked lustlackre.”Glenn Hoddle: “The Ref saw it so he must have been watching.”THIS week’s winner is Gemma Collins and Tiffany from Bride Of Chucky.

than others, including babies and children, elderly people, people with existing skin problems like eczema, those with respiratory problems like asthma and allergies and those with weakened immune systems.Colette Harris, Asthma UK’s Deputy Director of Digital Health, said: Coming into contact with mould can be a huge problem for the 1.1 million children with asthma in the UK, as it can cause allergic reactions, trigger asthma symptoms and in some cases, lead to a potentially life-threatening asthma attack.We would advise any parents who are concerned about their child’s medication to return it to where they bought it from.It is vital that parents of children with asthma who are allergic to mould avoid it where possible, especially as some babies and children are more likely to be affected by mould than adults.Parents should also look after their child’s asthma by making sure they are taking their preventer medicine as prescribed.If you have an affected batch you should stop using it and return the bottle to the shop you bought it from."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000001643495.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"families slam 20 year cover up of dr jane barton","story":"Dr Jane Barton was part of an “institutionalised regime” of giving the drugs without medical justification at Gosport War Memorial Hospital.Relatives of the victims yesterday demanded criminal charges for medical staff who wrongly allowed their loved ones to be given lethal doses of painkillers.They also called for the prosecution of those responsible for a 20-year cover up of the deaths of at least 656 patients from overdoses of medical heroin between 1989 and 2000.Bridget Reeves, whose gran Elsie Devine was among the victims, said: “These horrifying, shameful, unforgivable actions need to be disclosed in a criminal court for a jury to decide.“Only then can we put our loved ones to rest.”Bridget spoke out after a damning report said Dr Jane Barton, nicknamed Dr Opiate, oversaw an “institutionalised regime” of prescribing and administering dangerous doses of painkillers that was medically unjustified.It said consultants at Hampshire’s Gosport War Memorial Hospital knew what Barton was doing but did not intervene.Other medics failed to challenge her and carried on administering the dosages she prescribed.The report said it led to “a disregard for human life and a culture of shortening the lives of a large number of patients.”Bridget said the report had highlighted an “inexcusable failure” by the hospital.She added: “It is scandalous and it is immoral. They have grossly failed their ethical standards by abusing people’s human rights.“Our vulnerable relatives were stripped of their final words to their loved ones, silenced by overdoses. This has been sinister and calculated and those implicated must now face the rigour of the criminal justice system.“Hopefully people will wake up now and realise this is the largest national scandal under the NHS.”The inquiry into the Gosport deaths unearthed an astonishing catalogue of failure, arrogance, incompetence and indifference from medical staff, health officials, local politicians and the police.It said:In total there were four police and Crown Prosecution Service investigation and a General Medical Council hearing into Barton and the failings at Gosport.They failed to result in a single criminal prosecution.She was moved there after treatment at another hospital for a urinary infection.Staff had ruled she could go home but as there was no care provision in place she ended up in Gosport. Weeks later Elsie died of kidney failure after being prescribed strong painkillers.Granddaughter Bridget, above, said yesterday: “This sort of behaviour is both chilling and precarious.”Barton, now 70, was eventually found guilty of serious professional misconduct by a General Medical Council tribunal in 2010 following an investigation.It said she had put patients at risk of an early death. But she was not struck off.The tribunal instead placed restrictions on her, including a three-year ban on injecting opiates.She decided to retire following the ruling.She was admitted to recover from a hip op but died five days later.Her daughters Gillian Mackenzie and Lesley O’Brien told Hampshire Police she was “drugged to the eyeballs”.Mrs Mackenzie, 84, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, spent the next 18 years campaigning for justice. She said: “It’s been a massive cover up. It’s nice to know I wasn’t wrong.”But the Gosport Independent Panel said the focus on Barton had ignored the fact there was an “institutional” problem at Gosport that went beyond a single GP.It said this occurred because officials were haunted by the fear of “another Shipman.” Dr Harold Shipman is believed to have murdered as many as 250 patients between 1975 and 1998.Bishop James Jones, who led the panel, said: “Harold Shipman acted alone.The GP — the most prolific killer in modern history — prescribed opiate morphine in fatal doses to more than 200 victims, often elderly and female.Shipman, left, was caught only when suspicions were raised to cops over a forged will that gave the doctor claim to £386,000.Tests on the body of Kathleen Grundy then found she had died of an overdose of diamorphine — an easily injected form of recreational heroin.In 2000, 53-year-old Shipman was found guilty of 15 counts of murder and was jailed for life at Wakefield Prison, West Yorks.An inquiry indentified 218 victims and estimated he killed 250. The case led to an overhaul in how medication is dispensed.Shipman hanged himself in his cell on his 58th birthday in 2004.“Whereas what we’re describing in this report is an institutionalised practice and that is a significant difference.”The report criticised pharmacists, nurses and consultants for dispensing the drugs, administering them or turning a blind eye. It said families were “powerless” in their relationships with professional staff and were “consistently let down.”The police investigations into complaints by relatives were “consistently poor.”The 65-year-old’s family were told by a doctor that they were letting “nature take its course”.Stan’s daughter Debbie Mackay, 54, said: “It can’t be right a man who was admitted for rehab to die the following day.“We knew something wasn’t right from the start. It has been a constant battle to have our concerns taken seriously.”The 370-page report praised the families for never giving up their fight for justice.The panel cannot cannot call for criminal or civil action.But it urged ministers, police and the Attorney General to “recognise the significance” of its findings and “act accordingly.”Theresa May yesterday described the report as “deeply troubling” and apologised to families for the length of time it took to get answers from the NHS.A spokesman said: “We will consider the content of the report and will take any appropriate steps as required.”Meanwhile, police said some of the evidence in it had never been shown to them.Hampshire Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney said: “It’s apparent from our early reading of the 370 pages that in its deliberations, the panel had sight of information not previously seen by us.“It’s important that a process is put in place to ensure all relevant agencies come together to enable decisions about next steps to be made in a way that is well-considered and transparent.”Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was scandalous that nurse whistleblowers were ignored back in 1991. He added: “Had the establishment listened when junior NHS staff spoke out, had the establishment listened when ordinary families raised concerns instead of treating them as troublemakers, many of those deaths would not have happened.”He told MPs that police and prosecutors were examining the report to whether criminal charges should be brought.Three days before he was due home, he begged daughter Pauline Godley to get staff to stop giving him morphine.That night a nurse rang Pauline’s husband to say Arthur, 82, was dead.She said yesterday: “It was so heartless.“I want to see criminal charges and I want to see justice done now.“I feel so guilty because he asked me to save him and I didn’t.”Solicitor Hannah Travis said yesterday prosecutions will inevitably follow the report.She added: “Consultants were aware of Dr Barton’s actions but did not intervene — they are therefore culpable and should be held to account.“It is deeply distressing to see that even as early as 1991, nurses at the hospital were warned not to take their concerns further.“Why Dr Barton’s employment was not terminated at this stage beggars belief.”Dr Barton lives in Gosport with husband Tim, an ex-Royal Navy Commodore.They are currently thought to be in Spain.Earlier this week she said: “I don’t know what will be in the report, But I don’t think it will be very pleasant.“I’ve never spoken to the Press about what happened and I don’t plan to now.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Besides, I dont think the tickets were so cheap as to be unbelievable.Anthony Vale, 48, of Cheshire, booked four return tickets from Manchester to Dubai for £289 each after spotting the trips on Skyscanner.He told MoneySavingExpert: At the moment I dont know what I am going to do.

Under the scheme:Details of the ‘EU Settlement Scheme’ confirm promises made by Theresa May to Brussels during the Brexit negotiations but they are still likely to infuriate hardline Tories.The Home Office confirmed the Sun’s revelations that EU nationals applying for settled status will be charged £65 for each application – but said the cash would not cover the cost of the mammoth scheme.Sources insisted the Home Office was prepared for the huge scale of work the scheme will entail given the Windrush debacle. EU nationals will be able to apply online, over phone apps by taking a selfie and scanning their passports or through face-to-face meetings in local libraries.They will double the size of their European casework team from 700 to 1500 to cope with the extra work.Europeans were also promised the Home Office will rubber stamp applications to remain in Britain “within a few days” - giving security and peace of mind to people who  have made their lives here legally.In a statement Mr Javid said: “Publishing details of how we will administer our settled status scheme shows we are honouring commitments made towards EU citizens living in the UK.“But I am concerned that I have not seen any similar plans on how EU member states are going to support British nationals in their countries.“This is not good enough and I hope both the European Parliament and Commission will exert more pressure for them to do this as soon as possible.”Under current plans, the 1.2 million Brits living in the EU will only reserve the right to stay in their “host” country but would lose their current free movement rights.But Mr Javid wants guarantees that will be able to stay and treated fairly.If we left without a deal it would be up to individual countries to decide what to do.Hes previously said he will raise it with the EU Commission and urged MEPs to make it a top focus in Brussels.EU sources told the Sun last month that they were pushing the Commission and Council on this. We have repeatedly called for free movement rights for UK citizens.Mr Javid told a Lords Committee this morning that France and Spain needed to do more and say more.He added: I have every belief they will honour what they say, but we would like to see more movement.Speaking earlier today to a cross-party committee of peers, Mr Javid admitted: “Nothing like this has ever been done before.” He said the scheme would go live from the autumn and urged EU nationals to apply as soon as they could.He said: “The concern I’d have is that if people decide to put this off and wait until the end of 2020 we don’t want 3 million people in one month.”European Parliament Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt met with Mr Javid to discuss the plans on Tuesday.Speaking to MPs on Wednesday, the former Belgian PM said he still had concerns over the “cost” of the scheme but also how vulnerable Europeans living in Britain will be able to apply.The Home Secretary described the process that EU nationals currently in the country will have to go through after Brexit.He told a Lords committee today that minister want to make it as simple as possible and might not involve any paperwork having to be sent in to them.Mr Javid said. You have an app, you can put your passport next to your phone, and it will download your information.Then you can take a selfie - Im sure youve done that many times - you download it too, and match the information downloaded with the chip and confirm it electronically.Other details like National Insurance numbers would be taken through the app and cross referenced with existing information.But he also had to admit that there was an issue at the moment with whether it would work on iPhones, because of problems with Apples technology.However, ministers are working on the issue with Apple, and hope to get it resolved in time for the apps launch in the autumn.Mr Javid said he wanted trials to start in July with a full roll out following a few months later.And for those less tech savvy EU citizens, Mr Javid said they would be setting up shop in libraries and local council buildings to help register people in person too."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000415025999.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"quarter of brits stick to just three tried and tested recipes they can cook from scratch","story":"Researchers found the fear of getting a recipe wrong and wasting ingredients leads us to stick to the same meals over and over again.A study of 2,000 adults also revealed only four in 10 Brits know more than nine recipes, with the average amateur chef’s mental cookbook containing fewer than six meals.The survey, commissioned by the UK’s leading recipe box service, HelloFresh also revealed on average we cook every night and have six recipes in our repertoire.Our most popular dish to cook from scratch is good old bangers and mash.

Say it. Sorted.”Endless repetition probably cost her a million votes in last year’s catastrophic snap election and earned her the label “MayBot”.She did it again while hailing her long-overdue £380million-a-week Brexit boost for the health service.Her NHS treatment for diabetes helped her “get on with my job”, she said.Except, it didn’t. Her Type 1 diabetes deserves sympathy and understanding, but it has nothing to do with her job as PM.To lead is to choose. Mrs May chose to lead but suffers paralysis by analysis.Since achieving her dream of leading this country, Mrs May has failed to make the right choices at a pivotal moment in British history.As a sceptical Remainer, she was perfectly placed to steer Britain through the complex task of leaving the European Union.Her first act should have been to summon her Cabinet and tell them “Brexit means Brexit”, which means every minister and Whitehall mandarin must work their socks off to make it a success.And while staring Chancellor Phil Hammond in the eye, invite anyone who felt otherwise to find another job.Instead, she boxed herself in by triggering a rigid Brexit timetable, slapping £39BILLION cash on the table and inviting Brussels’ biggest bullies to do their worst.And they did. Any idea this would be a friendly divorce has turned to ashes. We are at war with Europe, if only by another name.This week we are likely to see their Commons cats’-paws, the increasingly triumphant Remoaners, take Mrs May and the UK to the brink of abject surrender.We are being forced to repeal the verdict of our biggest ever single-issue vote by screeching siren Anna “Suck it up” Soubry and hypocrite Tory lawyer Dominic Grieve, who yesterday said he and fellow rebels were prepared to bring down the Government if they are not granted a “meaningful vote” on the final Brexit deal.Obnoxious Soubry gives even Remainers a bad name, resorting to reckless slurs of “racism” even as her precious European Union is being torn apart by rows over uncontrolled mass immigration.She shrugs off the real grounds for scepticism about Brussels — its sneering contempt for democracy and the misbegotten euro, which has destroyed the job hopes of a generation of young Europeans.These were the failures which actually led to Brexit, long before Tony Blair flung open the door to 4million foreign migrants and German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the stakes with a million more.It was Merkel, as much as Blair and David Cameron, who soured the public view of Europe’s Grand Project years before Brexit ever became a possibility.But while it is easy to condemn defeated Remoaners as sore losers, it is hard not to be impressed by their organisational zeal, which would do credit to Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxist militia.By stark contrast, all of those who voted Out — and won — are entitled to be outraged by the performance of the Cabinet’s victorious Brexiteers.What the hell have they been doing for the past 18 months?They have been caught flat-footed, ambushed in the night, bound and gagged by a richly funded, highly motivated mob of undemocratic contemptibles. They should be shot for sleeping on the job.Boris trumpets the occasional bugle call. David Davis threatens to quit once a month. Michael Gove is busy elsewhere. And Liam Fox?They never talk to each other, prepare strategy or organise tactics, let alone mobilise financial backing or communicate with 17.4million supporters. Do they too think we are all thick and racistNow we risk the horrifying prospect of remaining half-in, half-out of the EU, robbed of our vote, our hard-won rebate and £39billion in hard cash.The game may be lost by default to the dark forces of organised bureaucracy: The Civil Service, the BBC, EU pensioners such as Peter Mandelson and those faceless Eurocrats.We shot their fox in The Glorious Referendum, only to let them regroup and return as a pack of wolves with a scent of blood.They had to suck it up or risk choking on the toxic fumes.But I think it sounds more like the punchline to a particularly revolting joke which is unsuitable for a family newspaper like this.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ministers today revealed details of the EU Settlement Scheme, which the UK\u0027s 3.8million EU citizens will have to use if they want to stay. Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd infamously claimed it would be “as easy as setting up an online account at LK Bennett” - a posh shoe shop. And Home Secretary Sajid Javid said it will be simple and straightforward adding: We will be looking to grant, not for reasons to refuse. So what do we know about the rights available to EU citizens in the UK - and how will they change? Here’s everything we know, including the costs, deadlines, and how to apply.  Britain and Brussels have agreed EU nationals can continue arriving, working and settling in the UK until 31 December 2020. So anyone who arrives before that date will have the right to apply to stay in the UK permanently. This will also apply the other way round, for Brits in the other 27 EU nations. It\u0027s not yet known what rights people will get if they arrive after that deadline. It\u0027s been suggested EU citizens will get preferential immigration rights compared to people from the rest of the world, but that\u0027s not confirmed.  EU citizens who have been in the UK for five years or more by the 31 December 2020 will be able to apply for settled status. This means they are free to continue living and working in the UK. People who have not lived in the UK for five years must apply for pre-settled status.  This gives them the right to stay until they reach the five year mark. At that point, they must apply again for the right to stay. When should I start applying?  The scheme will launch in the second half of 2018. Chiefs hope to begin testing an online platform with a small number of real cases from the end of the summer. There will then be a phased roll-out later this year. The Home Office says the scheme will be open fully by 30 March 2019 - the day after Britain officially leaves the EU. When is the deadline to apply? People who arrive by December 31, 2020 can apply for the scheme. The scheme will close to applications on 30 June 2021. How much will it cost?  EU citizens who live in the UK will pay a one-off charge of \u0026pound65. This will be halved to \u0026pound32.50 for children under 16. Children in care will have their applications handled for free. Those who already have permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain documents will also be processed for free. Can I apply online or on my phone?    Yes. The Home Office is designing an online application which it says will be simple and user-friendly.  Applicants will be asked to provide their biographical information, declare whether they have any criminal records, and upload a facial photograph. But there\u0027s a problem - at the moment, it won\u0027t work fully on iPhones. That\u0027s because Apple devices cannot read the chips on passports. Home Secretary Sajid Javid admitted: There is an issue at the moment. It\u0027s something we are discussing with Apple. Will I have to post off my passport?  Maybe - if you can\u0027t use the app. And this could include millions of people with iPhones (see above). The Home Office admits: Those who do not wish to or cannot use the app, or whose identity document is not compatible with it, will need to send us the document by post. Officials are trying to iron out the app problems, and are exploring options to let people attend somewhere to have their documents verified in person. But it\u0027s a work in progress. What questions will I be asked? All applicants will have to prove three things. First, they will be asked to prove their identity with a passport or ID card. In many cases this can be scanned and uploaded, but not all (see above). They will also be asked to declare any criminal convictions. And they will be asked to upload a photo of their face. The Home Office will then check employment and benefits data to confirm proof of residence. All those over 10 years old will be checked against crime registers and watch lists. In cases flagged up for concern, overseas criminal records can be checked - but this will not be automatic. Is settled status the same as citizenship?    No - it gives fewer rights, and doesn\u0027t offer a UK passport, but it also easier to apply for. EU citizens with settled status will lose that status - and their right to stay in Britain - if they leave the UK for more than five years. However, they will not need to prove their knowledge of language and life in the UK to get settled status. EU citizens who gain settled status in the UK can then apply for full citizenship a year later. What about pre-settled status? This does not grant a permanent right to stay, and EU citizens must keep up continuous residence in the UK to maintain it.  If EU citizens come from 2021 to join someone with settled status, they must keep up their relationship - i.e. a marriage - for five years to be able to qualify for themselves. Can I still go on holiday?  Yes. You have to keep \u0027continuous residence\u0027 for the first five years - but this generally means not leaving the country for more than six months a year. What about family members who live abroad?  Close family members who live abroad will be able to join an EU citizen in the UK after December 2020. Those family members can then apply for the scheme themselves. \u0027Close family\u0027 is defined as a husband or wife, civil partner, dependent child/grandchild, dependent parent/grandparent, or a partner who has lived with their partner for at least two years. Future children are protected, but brothers and sisters are not. Also, husbands/wives need to have either been married or in a \u0027durable\u0027 relationship already by the time of the 31 December 2020 cutoff date. For more details see the full document here. Can I still access the NHS? The Home Office says those who gain the status will have \u0027the same access as they currently do to healthcare, pensions and other benefits in the UK. This is pretty broad, but not quite the same as the rights UK citizens enjoy. Will I be rejected if I have a minor criminal offence?  No. Or at least, you shouldn\u0027t be. The Home Office document said this is a sensible approach, adding: We are not concerned here with minor offences, such as a parking fine. Applications will only be considered for refusal where someone has been convicted of a serious offence. How quickly will I be processed? Officials hope to provide applicants with a response within two weeks.  Will I have an \u0027ID card\u0027? No. Evidence of settled status will be given to EU citizens in digital form - no physical document will be issued. What if I\u0027m rejected?  Where a valid application is refused, there will be the right to request an administrative review. Someone who has been refused status under the scheme can make a new application at any point before the end of June 2021.  In addition, the government is planning to introduce a law giving a statutory right of appeal for applications made from March 30 next year. Applicants who are refused will be able to re-apply at any point, and however many times they want, up to the end of June 2021. What if I\u0027m from Ireland? Irish citizens enjoy a right of residence in the UK that\u0027s separate to the EU. So they will not have to apply for settled status, although they can if they want. What if I\u0027m from Norway, Liechtenstein, Iceland or Switzerland? These countries are not in the EU, but have close ties to Brussels. The UK wants a similar deal for citizens of these nations.  Talks are progressing well and the Home Office hopes to use the above system for these countries too. Is everyone happy about this?    No. Senior MPs have raised concerns hundreds of thousands of EU citizens could fall through the cracks of the new immigration scheme. Home Office ministers were warned that up to 200,000 EU nationals could be left without status if just 5% failed to register before the June 2021 cut-off. SNP home affairs spokeswoman Jo Cherry, speaking in the Commons, said: There are potentially significant numbers of people who could fall through the cracks here. Labour former minister Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, later raised the issue of children and asked what would happen in the event that a child was not registered. She said: Can she say whether this means that after that date they will not be lawfully resident here?  The Home Office - which has presided over bungles including the Windrush scandal - immediately faced questions about whether it will process people efficiently and in time. Some 1,500 Home Office staff will work on the project when it rolls out from Autumn this year - double the current number. Mr Javid admitted: I don\u0027t under-estimate the scale of the challenge, I do recognise that. Nothing like this has been done by the Home Office before. But Ms Nokes insisted: We are not anticipating failure. What about British citizens who live in the EU now?  More than 1million British citizens live in the other 27 EU countries. They will have the same rights to stay there as EU citizens have to stay in the UK. But it\u0027s not clear if they\u0027ll lose the right to move around and settle in any of the other 26 EU countries. Perhaps for this reason, applications for foreign citizenship - especially in Germany - have soared since the Brexit vote. And it\u0027s worth noting that among the British citizens that have applied for French residency since the Brexit vote is....Lord Lawson, the former chairman of the Vote Leave campaign.

CCTV images released today show Behailu Kebede, 45, fleeing the tower shortly before 1am on June 14 last year as the fire began to spread. Speaking today, Mr Kebede set out his desperation since losing everything on June 14 last year - compounded by a fear for his life - in a statement to the public inquiry. The Ethiopian-born Uber driver said media coverage painted a completely distorted picture that portrayed him like a criminal who was to blame for the fire. His upsetting written account ended: Sometimes I wish I had burned in the tower with the others. I have been burning inside ever since.  Mr Kebede was woken by the sound of his smoke alarm shortly before 1am on June 14, and found white smoke billowing from behind his fridge-freezer. He alerted his two female housemates, Elsa Afeworki and Almaz Kinfu, before knocking on every door of the neighbouring flats on the block\u0027s fourth floor and then rushing outside. Suggestions that he caused the fire by tampering with his fridge-freezer or that he had packed a bag before escaping led to safety concerns from the police. He said in a statement to the inquiry, published on Thursday: I met a number of officers there. They offered to take me to an unknown address outside London for my own protection. They wanted to put me into witness protection because they were concerned about reports in the press that showed me in a negative light, reports suggesting that I was to blame for the fire.  It was even suggested to me that I might need to change my name and not have any contact with my family. I told the police that I did not want to take part in any form of witness protection. Finally, they agreed to let me stay in a different part of London. As a result of the media intrusion, my partner and children were forced to move out of their home. The four of us have been living together in various hotels ever since. Security footage stills shown at the inquiry into the disaster on Thursday pictured Ms Afeworki walking down the stairs into the main lobby at approximately 12.56am, two minutes after the first 999 call. She is followed at around 12.58am by Mr Kebede, who is seen wearing just a T-shirt and a pair of trousers, but no shoes. Within two minutes, the first firefighter is seen entering the building. Mr Kebede had been saving to buy his fourth-floor flat in Grenfell Tower under Right to Buy and hoped to move his partner and two children in with him.  Instead, he left Flat 16 for the final time with only his phone, trousers and T-shirt - not even managing to put on a pair of shoes. His statement continued: Since the Grenfell Tower fire, my life has been a complete mess. For much of the time, I just wanted to be left alone. I had gone through a terrible ordeal that was affecting me mentally and physically. I wanted to meet the families of the bereaved but I did not have the courage to do so. I wanted to pay my respects to the deceased but felt unable to go out on my own. I believed that there were people out there who wanted to hurt my family and me. This was a very difficult time for me. I did not want to live under witness protection but I still took the threat posed to me seriously.  I genuinely feared for my life based on the information that the police gave me at that time. I knew so many of those who died in the fire at Grenfell Tower. I relive the horrific memories of that night all the time. I have not been able to sleep properly, thinking about those who died and seeing their faces when I close my eyes. Just talking about it is painful. I wish I could have banged on more doors and woken up more people. I am haunted by my failure to pick up my flat keys when I left and my inability as a result to get back into the building and warn more people. I feel broken inside. I am not the same man I used to be. I am still in fear, looking over my shoulder all the time. I do not feel comfortable in the presence of groups of four or more. I feel scared, as if I want to cry all the time. Sometimes I cannot even express myself and struggle to speak. Mr Kebede has not given evidence in person at the probe, saying through his lawyer that he was terrified.

He said fellow holidaymaker Steph Kendall, who was was allegedly on a nearby sun lounger, misheard a conversation between his pals during the lads holiday about previous relationships while sat around the pool. Legal firm worker Jack believes Steph misheard what he was saying and thought he was talking about last night - immediately putting a post up instructing his fiancee to \u0027bin him\u0027. The erroneous post read: If this is your boyfriend Jack staying at the Azuline Bergantin hotel Ibiza him and his friends have been proudly discussing that he cheated on you last night Hun #binhim. The post quickly went viral and received more than 10,000 likes and more than 15,000 shares, with people eventually locating Jack online.  Meanwhile, Love Island\u0027s Kady McDermott tweeted the image of Jack with the false accusation to her 357,000 followers, where it quickly started the hashtag #binhim on Twitter too. When he saw the post, Jack was flummoxed by the accusation and rushed to explain to his partner that it was untrue, who was waiting for him back in the UK.  Even when he confronted Steph in the hotel to explain she had misheard him, he claims she walked away from him - and the post remained being shared on Facebook .  Steph, from the North East, claims she removed the post on Tuesday afternoon - around 24 hours after it had been shared. Despite having named and shamed Jack herself, she demanded not be named in the article \u0027without her permission\u0027. Now Jack is bravely speaking out and calling for tougher regulations on social media users accusing people of things that \u0027ruin their lives with no concrete evidence\u0027. Jack, from Essex, said: It\u0027s devastating because I haven\u0027t done anything wrong. I haven\u0027t had any sexual relations with a woman on this holiday. I haven\u0027t kissed another woman or even kissed another woman on the cheek on this holiday. It\u0027s literally bizarre.  In the post she claims I said I slept with someone the previous night. I have two mates of mine who were witnesses there and those sentences never came out of my mouth. She\u0027s posted a picture of me online, written a status, done a hashtag saying \u0027bin him\u0027, and now it\u0027s gone absolutely viral. [The post is] more or less going to cripple my relationship. It\u0027s more or less crippled right now to be honest. My partner is talking about how she\u0027s not willing to even get married. It\u0027s really upsetting. She\u0027s more or less almost cost me my future marriage. It\u0027s got to that point now. I can understand it from [my partner\u0027s] point of view because if it happened to me, if there was a photo going about saying that she\u0027d said she\u0027d slept with a bloke the previous night, I\u0027d be exactly the same. I\u0027d be really embarrassed and I\u0027d be considering breaking up the relationship as well, like anyone would. At the moment I\u0027m clutching onto straws to try and keep everything together, but it\u0027s really difficult. She may not want to be with me by the time I get back.  Jack proposed to his girlfriend in January 2017 and has been in a relationship with her for two years. The distraught holidaymaker was inundated with messages from people who realised the picture was him - and he even worries that his boss at work now knows. Jack said: I am upset. I\u0027m really upset about the whole situation. I am distraught. I am depressed. I am devastated, shocked. I\u0027m in a lot of pain really, emotionally. The story is not true. I don\u0027t even know her, she was just sitting on a sunbed next to me while I was talking to a couple of mates about previous relationships and stuff like that. Somehow she claims to have heard me specifically say that I slept with a girl last night. When I confronted her face to face she couldn\u0027t tell me what I said. For me, that just makes me wonder how she\u0027s come to this point that she\u0027s able to say I said these words. I haven\u0027t done anything wrong to her, I haven\u0027t abused her in any way, I haven\u0027t said any names to her in any way.

Clare Clifford awoke to find little Charlotte not breathing in the early hours of the morning, with the child pronounced dead soon after.  An inquest today heard doctors could not rule out the possibility that Clare\u0027s seven-month-old died in bed after she rolled over onto her.  Evidence from a pathologist found the infant was placed in an unsafe sleeping situation with an intoxicated mother on the night she died. But revealing her devastation earlier this year, light sleeper Clare insisted she just wouldn\u0027t have rolled onto her daughter She said: I’m always going to be wondering if I didn’t have her in bed that night - I’ll wonder that for the rest of my life.”  She added: “In my heart of hearts I know I didn’t roll onto Charlotte. I just wouldn’t. I’m such a light sleeper and she was a very vocal baby.” The inquest into Charlotte\u0027s death heard how Clare had got into bed with the infant at midnight after drinking with her husband James. The couple had been drinking in their home, the hearing was told, with the mum saying she was in control of herself at all times. She awoke in bed with her baby at 4am on June 18 last year. Charlotte was rushed to Leeds General Infirmary, West Yorkshire, after she was found not breathing, but doctors were unable to save her. She was pronounced dead 45 minutes later. According to evidence from pathologist Michael Parsons read out to the court, there was no specific post-mortem finding confirming death as a result of overlaying. However, the doctor also stated in a report that death caused by overlaying remained a possibility that could not be excluded.  In written evidence read out by coroner Jonathan Leach to Wakefield Coroner\u0027s Court, Clare told how she described herself as merry on June 17, 2017. The evidence read On a scale of one-ten I would describe myself as a five. I am used to drinking alcohol and am used to drinking moderately - I was in control of myself at all times. Clare also wrote how she had been advised of the risk of co-sleeping, but she had never been told not to do it. And the digital marketing manager said she had never been told there could be a criminal offence with consuming alcohol. The court heard how she had slept with Charlotte in the bed with her back to the wall while arm-in-arm to prevent the baby being caught in pillows or falling out of bed. Detective Inspector Phil Jackson, of West Yorkshire Police, told the court how he had spoken at length with the infant\u0027s parents following her death. He said: It\u0027s obvious they were both caring and loving parents. As part of the process I went to the scene and reviewed what was there but there were no signs of neglect.

Just hours after they declared \u0027til death do us part on June 3, the groom posted on Facebook seeming to hit out at those questioning whether they had really be together forever. For all those doubters, get it up yi, he said, while describing his wife as the most unbelievable looking woman I have ever seen in my, she looked sensational. The gushing newlywed added: No words can describe how beautiful she was, a wedding only most can dream about and we made it reality.

He put his ring up for sale for \u0026pound400 and posted messages shared between Meaghan and her lover. Andy, from Kelty, Fife, claimed the affair started on her hen night. The bride admitted the affair but claimed she had not slept with her lover until after the wedding. Meaghan said: We did not have sex on our hen do - it was after the wedding.

Photos of the wedding on Facebook show the apparently happy couple frolicking on the beach with their well-dressed guests. But barely a fortnight later the groom decided to make a very public statement that their marriage was over. He posted on Facebay Fife, advertising the rings: Hi, recently I got married in Mexico on the 3rd of June and this was the wedding set I used while Meaghan Mitchell said her marriage vows. He claimed: However, six days later I found out she started having an affair on her hen night and it carried on for eight weeks through our dream wedding.

An employee from BOMO Parking Services turned up at Bournemouth Airport in Dorset and left the bag containing about 300 customers keys at an information desk.  He then reportedly fled the airport without saying a word to anyone. Staff had the challenge of matching up the keys to holidaymakers arriving home from breaks in Europe. There were chaotic scenes in the terminal building as passengers tried to find their keys and cars that had been parked off-site. Airport security staff had to drive people half a mile to the car park to collect their vehicles.  One group of four friends from Southampton - Lisa and Michael Russell and Charlotte and Aidan Thorne - were left stranded at the airport after their keys were lost in the chaos. They had to call out a locksmith to get into their vehicle. Many customers were unaware there was any problem until they arrived back from their holidays, although some reported receiving a text or email from the company stating it had gone bust. In a statement, BOMO Parking Service blamed the decision to fold the company on a sustained attack on its business by a known individual which had a catastrophic effect. Three weeks ago two customers\u0027 cars were defaced in a vandalism attack and valeting equipment and CCTV cameras were also damaged.  Holidaymaker Mrs Russell, who had been on holiday in Malaga, said they had no idea the parking company was in trouble. She said: We used them once before and had absolutely no problem and even when we were leaving they were very friendly - there was no worry about anything going wrong. We had no message from the company explaining what\u0027s happened. But to come back and find that your keys have been lost and you can\u0027t get home is really upsetting. The airport staff have been really helpful and it\u0027s not their fault this has happened. It\u0027s just such a shame that we\u0027ve had a wonderful holiday and then this happens as soon as we come back.  In a statement on its website BOMO Parking Services said: BOMO Parking Services has ceased trading with immediate effect. All vehicle keys have been hand delivered to Bournemouth Airport information desk for customers to collect on their return from holiday. All future car park bookings have been cancelled with immediate effect. BOMO Parking Services has been the target of a sustained attack online and offline by a known individual, which has had a catastrophic effect on the trading position, causing closure. An airport employee said staff from the company had been at the airport on Tuesday and had not given any suggestion that anything was wrong, even discussing the fact they had installed new top-of-the-range CCTV cameras to replace the ones that had been destroyed. The company\u0027s site was based at land next to the Adventure Wonderland theme park, close to the airport.

Katie Smith, 18, from Oldham, Manchester, dropped to just 6st 7lbs after losing a shocking 4st 7lbs, and was so skinny that she wore children\u0027s size 10-11 clothes. Then aged 15, Katie restricted her food to just 100 calories a day, consumed 40 laxatives and jogged on the spot for hours. But, in November 2017, after being admitted for inpatient treatment, she recovered and now weighs 10st 2lbs and is a size 10.  Katie, a student at North Chadderton Sixth Form College, says: I realised that if I carried on, I would die. It really made me want to get better. Having an eating disorder was awful, I never thought I\u0027d make my 18th birthday. Growing up, Katie was a competitive swimmer and was always a healthy weight. I was never bigger than a size 10 but my frame was muscly and I weighed around 11st, she said. It was never anything that I worried about though.  But in February 2014, then aged 14, Katie developed bulimia. I would binge eat up to 5,000 calories before purging it up, she said. It became a cycle but, all the extra calories made me gain weight. In December 2015, Katie was trying on a size 12 bridesmaid\u0027s dress for the wedding of her sister, Joanne, 34, a teacher, when her eating patterns spiralled out of control. Katie said she felt horrendous.  The fabric clung to my figure and I hated how I looked, she said. After that, I developed anorexia. I exercised excessively every day, jogging on the spot for hours and performing 500 sit-ups. I only allowed myself to eat 100 calories of vegetables daily and I took 40 laxatives. Some days I\u0027d eat nothing and I weighed myself constantly. I was determined to fit into the dress and look skinny at the wedding. I wanted to look good for the pictures.  Unsurprisingly, Katie\u0027s weight plummeted and within six months, her 5ft 5in frame weighed just 6st 7lbs. She added: I could fit into size 10-11 children\u0027s clothes, but I purposefully wore baggy clothes to hide how bony my frame was. I even stopped swimming when I was 14 so mum would never realise how skinny I\u0027d gotten. My muscles ached constantly and I always felt cold. I had to wear multiple layers of clothes and my periods completely stopped. Handfuls of hair would fall out while I was in the shower and I\u0027d be left with clumps of hair on my pillow. It was terrifying. In February 2016, Katie attended her sister\u0027s wedding in Ireland and by this point she\u0027d already lost 2st 7lbs leaving her a size 6 and 8st 7lbs.  I was really looking forward to the wedding but on the day, I felt awful, she said. I didn\u0027t manage any of the wedding food. I felt huge even though now I realise I wasn\u0027t. My dress was a size 8 and hung off me. I pretended to family members that I\u0027d eaten and played with the food on my plate. In March 2016 Katie was diagnosed with anorexia by her psychiatrist and she was admitted as an inpatient at the Hope Unit, Bury, Greater Manchester, where she underwent therapy for three months. A month later, she reached her lowest weight of 6st 7lbs. In June 2016, she was discharged as an outpatient but she relapsed over the summer.  Katie said: I felt self-conscious about my weight and how I looked, especially when my friends were wearing bikinis. I started restricting food again. It got completely out of control. For the next 17 months until November 2017, Katie was in and out of hospital battling her eating disorder. It was tough I missed a year of college to concentrate on getting better, she said. Then one day, I realised that I didn\u0027t want to die I knew that if I carried on, I wouldn\u0027t make it. I upped my calorie intake and stopped exercising. I realised my health was more important.

Maisie Buchanan, two, was diagnosed with infant psoriasis as a baby and spent weeks in hospital . The rare condition causes her skin to flare-up and turn bright red and scaly. But her disgusted parents Lesley Buchanan, 35, and Alistair Buchanan, 36, have become fed-up at cruel strangers shunning her in the street and even accusing them of scalding their child.  Lesley said: People assume the worst and that she\u0027s been scalded. Others have asked if I left her out in the sun too long or forgot to put her sun hat on. They will ask me \u0027what\u0027s wrong with her?\u0027 like I\u0027m a neglectful parent. I always respond \u0027there\u0027s nothing wrong with her, she\u0027s a happy sweet little girl with a skin condition.\u0027 Maisie\u0027s skin is very flushed, it can go lobster red, and if she\u0027s flaking she looks different. People pick up on that and it\u0027s very hurtful. It really hurts that people think like that, it\u0027s like a knife to the heart.  Lesley and Alistair, from Falkirk, Scotland, have to slather their daughter in skin cream four times a day to help treat psoriasis, which has eased since her diagnosis in early 2017. The tot also has to have weekly injections of medicine. She wears special mittens to stop her clawing at her skin during the night. But Lesley continued: My husband was with her in a supermarket when her face was very inflamed and a woman in her sixties said to him \u0027look at the state of your child\u0027. She implied that he couldn\u0027t look after his child if her face looks like that.  I just want to get a megaphone and shout \u0027it\u0027s infant psoriasis and she\u0027s not contagious\u0027. I feel like saying \u0027she\u0027s not going to lick you and you\u0027re not going to catch something\u0027. It\u0027s when adults say something that it\u0027s upsetting. I\u0027ve heard children say \u0027what\u0027s wrong with that baby\u0027s skin?\u0027 but that doesn\u0027t bother me as they are curious about it. With adults common sense seems to go out the window. I\u0027ve had people look at her and ask if she\u0027s contagious and move their children away with a look of passive disgust on her face.  Recalling the traumatic diagnosis, retail supervisor Lesley said: We spoke to the health visitor who thought she might have been teething and rubbing her face but the mark got bigger and another appeared on her right cheek.

Some parts of the UK are expected to see up to 10 days of sweltering temperatures, despite freak snow on the summer solstice.  Football fans will likely enjoy a BBQ weekend with 27C highs - with England due to take on Panama in the World Cup on Sunday. And by the middle of next week, temperatures could hit the low 30s.  The warm weather will roast large parts of Britain, with high pressure dragging baking air from the Mediterranean across the country.     Some computer models have indicated there will be a prolonged hot spell for areas of southern England, the Midlands and Wales. For locations further north , the values are only slightly lower. June is on track to be Britain’s hottest for 42 years, since 1976’s famous heatwave, Met Office statistics for the first half of June show. The UK average temperature of 14.7C - 1.7C above normal - from June 1-14 is the warmest June since 1976’s 15.0C over the whole of the month, figures show. June’s rainfall is also down by half – at just 19mm – amid 82 hours of sunshine, the Met Office said.  Met Office forecaster Bonnie Diamond said: “It’s warming up from the weekend and for next week as high pressure drags up warmer air from the continent. “Sunday could see 26C and from Wednesday looks like the low 30s in the South, with sunny and warm weather lasting until at least the end of next week.” Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “It’s a BBQ weekend, with 27C possible by Sunday. In contrast, snow and -12C windchill surprised summer solstice hikers on the longest day of the year as a one-day chill hit from Iceland. And there is more snow forecast later on Scotland’s higher ground following flurries near Glen Affric, near Loch Ness, Highland.  Taking to Twitter today, professional photographer James Roddie wrote: “Snowing on the summits!” Mountain Weather Information Service said: “Showers snow are possible on the highest tops, with wind chill feeling like -10C or locally colder.” Despite this, experts are confident that the UK will bask in very warm temperatures by the beginning of next week.  A scorching southerly air flow is expected to blow northwards from France​, Spain and Portugal​, The Weather Channel says.  ​The mercury could rocket into the low 30s by Wednesday under baking sunshine, with just a light breeze.  ​​Meteorologist Amy Hodgson, of The Weather Channel, said: “It is looking like we’re going to get some lovely hot and sunny weather. “There is now high confidence that temperatures will increase to above to well-above normal through next week. “Sunny, dry and very warm conditions are expected across much of Europe under high pressure that will be centred across the British Isles on Monday, with temperatures reaching the high 20s across England. “As the high gradually drifts eastwards through the midweek period, temperatures will rise further in the southerly flow around the western flank of the high.

And that means there are more daylight hours to have some fun with your family! So why not make the most of the extra daylight by getting out and about for some fun activities? Although the time of sunset varies between the south of the UK and the north, you should expect between 16.5 and 17.5 hours of daylight. So why not plan a late picnic or watch the sun set over the coast? The longest longest day  Want to maximise the amount of daylight you get? Head north. The further you go, the more daylight hours you’ll have. At the North Pole, summer months are constantly lit by a never setting sun. But going to the North Pole is tricky enough at the best of times, let alone on a Thursday afternoon when you have work the next day.  But there are less extreme trips you can make. For example, even the northern tip of Scotland sees days that are longer than those in at the tip of Cornwall. Indeed, on the summer solstice it\u0027s common for a kind of all-night twilight that means it never really feels like night. If you want to experience the longest day in the UK then you should jump on a plane to Orkney. The island of Unst has the most northerly campsite in the UK called Saxa Vord Resort. It\u0027s here that you can experience a day that lasts 19 hours and 10 minutes, with a sunset at 10:40pm. That\u0027s great for a late picnic or barbecue - but less than ideal if you\u0027re trying to get some sleep! If you\u0027re going to make this journey, don\u0027t forget to get the Garmin Drive Sat Nav , above, for the bit you\u0027re doing in a car. With lifetime map updates you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road. The shortest longest day   For those who want to shorten the longest day so they can get an earlier night, head to the Isles of Scilly. Scilly isn\u0027t the most accessible place in the UK and you\u0027ll need to catch a propeller-powered plane to the island from Cornwall and from there a boat to St Agnes. The island of St Agnes has a campsite called Troytown, which will see only 16 hours, 21 minutes and 24 seconds of daylight. Sunset is still at 9:37 though, which is pretty late if you\u0027ve got very little ones. The views from the campsite are spectacular though, with views out over the sea and lush green grass all around.  The Halfords 6 Person Tent is now just \u0026pound90 (save \u0026pound110), and is absolutely perfect for a summer solstice adventure. It\u0027s full walk-in height throughout, with a large living area big enough for a table and chairs. You\u0027re also guaranteed a good night\u0027s sleep, thanks to the double skin design with additional side and roof ventilation.  The Troytown campsite also allows barbeques, so take along the Halfords Briefcase BBQ which is now less than half price at just \u0026pound5 (was \u0026pound15, save \u0026pound10). The family-sized grill folds into a briefcase shape for portability, so it\u0027s a must-have for campers.  Alternatively, if you really want to cook up a treat you could take along the portable Halfords Double Stove With Grill which is now just \u0026pound25 (half price, was \u0026pound50). It features two upwards burners to use with pans and a downward burner which is great for using with the included toast rack.  Don\u0027t go anywhere, the football is on!   If you\u0027re a football fanatic then perhaps you\u0027ll want to stay home to catch some of the action. If that\u0027s the case then you can still make the most of the day. Set up a home picnic in the garden so everyone can enjoy either food, the football or both. You\u0027ll still get the benefit of a long day to spend with your family. Shelter from the rays under the Halfords 300 Fully Waterproof Gazebo , \u0026pound69 (was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21). This rather brilliant shelter offers 50+ UV protection, so it\u0027s perfect for sunny days - plus, it will keep you dry if there\u0027s a sudden shower! If you\u0027re looking to make an evening of it, why not set up a tent and let the kids stay in it overnight. They\u0027ll have an exciting time enjoying the light fade late and it will make a great story for school the next day.  To get everything ready for this sporting and eating extravaganza you\u0027ll want to pick up the Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket , \u0026pound10 (half price) so everyone can sit between matches.  If you are entertaining friends and family, chances are extra seating will be required - so grab a Folding Picnic Table with Stools for just \u0026pound25 (was \u0026pound40, save \u0026pound15). Plastic cups and plates are much safer when you\u0027re entertaining a large group, especially with the kids running around. Stock up on Plastic Plates , Plastic Bowls and Plastic Tumblers which come in packs of six for just \u0026pound3 each (half price).

Alex Musk, 30, proposed to Samm Sexton, 29, just two days after meeting her earlier this month. Samm had spent \u0026pound1,138 on flights from Indiana, USA, to the UK for a two-week trip to meet Alex after chatting on a Facebook community. The pair bonded for six months online after discovering they both had beloved Boston terriers named Lola.  And just days into the trip, Alex dropped down on one knee and popped the question during a romantic picnic in Leeds, West Yorks. I was beyond excited when Alex asked me to marry him - it just felt so right. During the time we were apart we\u0027d talk all day every day. In his lunch break he\u0027d call me and we were in constant contact, Samm said. The call centre worker flew back to the US on Thursday but is hoping to get a visa to stay in the UK permanently.  She added: I saw him then he looked up and saw me and I couldn\u0027t stop smiling. He was everything I\u0027d hoped he\u0027d be. It was amazing to get my arms around him finally. When he proposed I wasn\u0027t too surprised. I knew it was coming but I thought it was amazing. As for moving from the US to the UK, I\u0027m excited for it. It will be a huge difference but it\u0027s one I\u0027m ready for. My family and friends are very supportive. They will miss me of course but we will still visit and keep in touch.  The couple are now planning their wedding in which their beloved dogs, Alex\u0027s two-year-old and Samm\u0027s seven-year-old Boston terriers, will play starring roles. Alex, who is a disability support worker, said: Last Saturday we visited York overnight and I proposed to her then. I knew by January that I wanted to marry her but waited until we were together to pop the question. We went for a picnic at York Museum Gardens and I asked her then. It was an immediate yes. I bought the ring two months ago, it\u0027s a moonstone ring that Samm said she loved so I ordered it in secret. Her eyes lit up when I got down on one knee and her hands flew to her face.

Maybe that person is even you. There\u0027s a fine line, however, between being a chatterbox and alienating everyone around because of your incessant droning on and love-affair with the sound of your own voice. Conversation is a two-way street. You have to listen as well as be heard.  Sadly, not everyone has got this memo. Like Gary, for example, who came to stay with Reddit user Bri, and spent the duration of his visit talking about himself, talking over others, and not listening.  So Bri got her own back - and is now in dog house. My husband Will has a friend named Gary who arrived on Sunday night to stay with us for the week, she begins.  Gary and Will are friends from university and while they used be close, they\u0027ve not seen each other in years. Bri continues: This is the first time I\u0027ve met Gary. Three days into his visit and I\u0027m struggling, guys. Gary talks non-stop. We\u0027re not just talking about Gary being excited at seeing his old friend, and being gossipy and chatty. Oh no. As Bri explains: He literally talked (mostly about himself) throughout the entire dinner last night. He kept talking after dinner. He kept talking until we went to bed. He has an opinion about EVERYTHING. Will and I barely got any words in or got talked over. My husband could tell I was about to lose my cool by the time I excused myself for bed. Will apologised when he came to bed and says he remembered that Gary talked a lot but did not know he was going to do it incessantly and so rudely. So the couple hatched a plan and decided we would put more effort into speaking up/interjecting.    However, the next night, Gary had somehow managed to up his game.  Tonight, the three of us went out to try a new restaurant and it didn\u0027t go well, Bri continues. Gary kept trying to monopolise the conversation and would talk over me. I said \u0027EXCUSE ME, please allow me to finish\u0027, and he laughed and apologised because he \u0027knows he talks too much\u0027 and then KEPT TALKING. My husband then interjected and said, \u0027Gary I would like to hear what Bri has to say\u0027. So Gary apologised again and let me talk. But the victory was short-lived. When I finished, he nodded and then started continuing with whatever he was saying without acknowledging my point.  Bri had had enough. In her own words: I was done being polite at this point. I was mad and highly irritated. I had already had a couple of drinks and thought, \u0027F**k. This. Noise.\u0027 The the food arrived - and presented Bri with the perfect opportunity for revenge. Gary just sits there in front of his plate talking and talking. So I pushed my salad aside and grabbed his plate of untouched steak. And I started eating it. He stopped talking, looked stunned, and said, \u0027Bri, what are you doing?\u0027 I ignored him and kept eating his steak.  He looks kind of p****d and says, \u0027please stop eating my steak!\u0027 I ignored him and ignored Will\u0027s death stare and kept eating Gary\u0027s steak. I ate the whole thing. They watched me and Gary didn\u0027t speak a word the whole time and I got to eat in glorious silence. Then I apologised to Gary and said some s**t like, \u0027I know I eat too much and should have let him finish his steak. Gary tried to like...laugh it off? He didn\u0027t talk on the ride home. Unfortunately for Bri, she can\u0027t seem to catch a break.  Now her husband is beyond p****d at me and has asked me to apologise to Gary. I\u0027ve agreed to apologise because what I did was NOT the right way to handle the situation. My question is...how do I handle this for the rest of the week? Should I just stay away from him? Or is that being rude on top of my super rudeness? In this instance, no one thinks Bri is in the wrong - and it turns out A LOT of people know a Gary.

No one was an automatic pick, you had to play for your place.“Before he came to Dens Park it was like that, too many were.“When he came in there was a big clearout. He revolutionised the team.“A lot of the squad were ageing and just going through the motions at the end of their career.“At that time Dundee weren’t expected to do much, they were a big club but, after the success in the early 50s, there were a few years of doing not very much.“He also brought in some older guys who we all wondered about.“He brought in Bobby Wishart, who was 32 at the time, Bobby Seith was 30, but they were revelations.”Shankly also revolutionised the style of football on display at Dens Park.“We were an out-and-out attacking team,” Ure added.“We could defend when we needed to but we used to go at the opposition and test them.“We had a lot of seasoned players like Bobby Cox and Gordon Smith and some really good ones like Alan Gilzean and Alan Cousin. There was a perfect balance to the team.“We wanted to play football – there was no humping it up the pitch and chasing after it.“We were a possession-based team, one of the first in Scotland to keep the ball. It was a European style and that helped us in the European run the next season and why we did so well.“I think that foxed the European teams because they expected the usual Scottish kick and chase so they’d have the ball for 15 minutes at a time – the difference was we were keeping the ball!”That run in Europe saw the Dark Blues hammer Sporting Lisbon and then Anderlecht before falling to AC Milan in the last four.“The Anderlecht game was the best ever. We played at the Heysel Stadium and the whole ground clapped us off at the end, they all rose and clapped.“We were wondering what was happening. We played the stuff you see all great teams play and passed a good side off the park.“They were great days.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29b42d531-435x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc four of the very best to have pulled on dark blue","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor what is a mid-sized club by Scottish standards, over their history it’s fair to say Dundee have punched well above their weight when it comes to producing and attracting top talent.In today\u0026#8217s look down memory lane, as we celebrate their 125th birthday, we highlight the very best of what has been a quality crop.Billy Steel: However long there is a Dundee FC, no list of the club’s greatest performers will ever be complete without the name Billy Steel.When director/manager George Anderson snapped the Scottish international inside-forward up from Derby County for a record £22,500 in September 1950, it went down as one of the transfer coups of the decade.Regarded as world class but known for being difficult to manage, Steel repaid the faith Anderson had shown in him and, in the next four years, would inspire Dundee to two League Cups.Steel left Dens in 1954 when he quit the senior game aged just 31. He moved to America where he died in 1982 but, 36 years later, remains regarded as one of Scotland’s greatest players.Claudio Caniggia: It was a case of 1950 and Billy Steel all over again when, in October 2000, Dundee sent tremors through the football world by announcing the signing of Argentine World Cup star Claudio Caniggia.In desperate need of a replacement for injured striker Fabian Caballero, the Dee’s Italian manager Ivano Bonetti used his Serie A connections and fixed up Caniggia, a former Roma team-mate of his brother and assistant Dario.In the end, the man who was Diego Maradona’s favourite strike partner for Argentina did not stay long at Dens Park, making just 21 league appearances and scoring seven goals, before heading for Rangers at the end of the 2000/01 campaign.Both for his performances and the gentlemanly way he conducted himself off the park, the impact he had on Dundee was considerably greater than the time he spent at Dens Park.Alan Gilzean: If there’s a debate over who the best-ever Dundee player is, when to comes to putting the ball in the net there can be no argument.Although down the years the club can boast some prolific scorers, there never has been, and is never likely to be, anyone who could match the ability of the legendary Alan Gilzean.Over 40 years after his playing career with the Dark Blues and then Spurs came to an end, those who saw him or played with or against him still regard him as being a world class centre-forward.Born in Coupar Angus, Dundee were his first senior club. He score an unequalled total of 169 goals for them and won the league in 1961/62 before being transferred to Spurs, where he enjoys similar legendary status, in 1964.Doug Cowie: The sands of time mean in some ways he is the forgotten man of Dundee greats but never to those who saw or played alongside Doug Cowie.Signed by George Anderson in 1945, over the next 16 years the Aberdonian would make a record 446 appearances, win two League Cups and also appear in two World Cups for Scotland.Cowie left Dens at the end of the season before the club won the championship but many of those who played in the side that clinched the title have often referred to the influence he had over their development on the pitch.As well as nurture it, Cowie would go on to show himself as an adept talent spotter. Once his playing days were over he worked for Dundee United and, along with fellow-scout Davie Small, was credited by Jim McLean as being instrumental in unearthing many of the local players who went on to bring the league flag to Tannadice in 1983.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2781041b59a-126x180.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc how did it all start for the dark blues","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAt times during their history, Dundee Football Club have proudly boasted of being the city’s oldest professional football club.While celebrations of their 125th birthday this year are confirmation of that, what the Dark Blues can’t claim to be is the first.Indeed, it was the growing popularity of the game late in the 19th century that led to their very existence, through the desire of smaller local outfits to challenge at a national level.The club was in some ways down to the existence of a man about whom little is known. He was Andrew Buttar, president of the Dundee Charity Football Association and, importantly, an official of one of the clubs already on the go in the city – Our Boys.Buttar felt that by joining forces with one of their big local rivals, East End, a new club representing the city as a whole would be capable of doing it proud at national league level.Perhaps surprisingly given the strong tribal nature of football even at that time and the fact an earlier attempt at amalgamation was thrown out by members of the clubs, within a month of him publicly airing the idea they’d met and put together an application for Scottish League membership.So it was that on June 12, 1893, at their AGM, the new Dundee Football and Athletic Club was admitted to the league.In doing so they beat off competition from Cowlairs and, more notably an Edinburgh-based outfit going by the name of Hibernian – whatever happened to them?With just two months to the start of the new season, there was plenty work to be done and, less than two weeks after the league vote, a committee, of which Buttar was vice-president, had been formed to run things.A home for the team had also to be found and, when hopes of playing at Carolina Port were dashed by another local side, Strathmore, obtaining the lease for it, Our Boys’ home at West Craigie Park, a ground that lay roughly between Albert Street and Morgan Street, was earmarked.Work to get it ready for the national league was hastily arranged and carried out. At the same time the committee set about putting together a team capable of competing at a higher level. For the most part that involved picking the best performers from East End and Our Boys, though Scotland cap Sandy Keillor and a team-mate from Montrose, goalie Billy McKie, were also brought in.So it was that, on August 12, barely three months on from the bid to form the club had gained real momentum, Dundee ran out to face Rangers at West Craigie Park on the first day of the new Scottish League season.The Gers were already a well- established league outfit and had secured their first title just two years earlier, so for Dundee to come from two goals down to earn their first league point from a 3-3 draw was a creditable performance.On top of the result, further vindication of the decision to move to the big stage came in the shape of a healthy 5,000 turnout for the game.After a-not-unexpected defeat at eventual champions Celtic the following week, a first win came in the second home game at the end of August when Renton were edged out 3-2.The 18-game campaign would yield a further five wins and two draws for an eighth-place finish and, although that meant they had to apply for re-election, the bid was successful. That first season also saw the team switch to first choice home Carolina Port, the ground many fans still believe was their original home.And if that first campaign couldn’t quite be described as auspicious, it was a start and the beginning of an eventful next 125 years.n Tomorrow – The Managers.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.741936.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc humble claudio caniggia was even better off pitch barry smith","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee legend in his own right, Barry Smith captained the club for nine years before returning as manager in 2010.During that time he saw some of the best and some of the worst times in the history of the club.Among the best, however, was playing alongside some top-quality team-mates.And one name that stands out is Claudio Caniggia.Barry said: “I grew up watching guys like him play in World Cups, so I feel really fortunate to have played with Caniggia.“What made him stand out is, no matter how much he had done in the game before, he was so humble and had great humility.“What stood out for me is how he took time to help out the younger lads in training. Guys like Steven Milne and Graham Bayne owe a lot to him.“That was just the type of guy he is, very humble, no airs and graces and he took a lot of time with younger players that a lot of other players wouldn’t.“The first time he came in, he immediately made sure he was part of the team.“He didn’t just stand around, he got involved straight away.“Claudio didn’t want to be a superstar or anything, just wanted to be part of a team. His attitude was superb.“A lot of players could take a lesson from him. Every day he knew he still had to work hard.“I remember him as much off the park as on it because he was so good on the training ground.”Barry had another name he’d stick into the mix from his time at Dundee.“Georgi Nemsadze was the most technically gifted player I played with,” he added.“I knew when I won the ball, I could give it to him no problem.“I was very lucky to play alongside him.“I have to say, those guys did what they did because there were other guys in the team doing their jobs.“Guys like Lee Wilkie, Gavin Rae and me were the workhorses for the team and we allowed the players with all the flair to go and do their stuff.”As manager, Barry had to deal with some of the darkest times at Dens as the club headed into a second administration – the people at the club, however, managed to turn that time into one of the best at Dundee with the ‘Deefiant’ season.He added: “I do believe if the team hadn’t stayed up someone would have shut the doors at Dens.“Collectively everyone responded, the coaching staff, office staff, players and definitely the fans rallied around the club.“Though it was a really negative time, we turned it into a positive one which then led to promotion the following year.“I don’t like to single anybody out but Robert Douglas played a massive part.“It’s difficult to say just how much he helped gelling the players together.“All the players and their wives and families were invited round to his all the time and that really generated the team spirit.“He really made sure the team was a real team and that’s not even talking about what he did on the park.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/976302492.jpg-279x180.jpg ","title":"argentina cant expect messi to carry them says dundee hero caniggia","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee star Claudio Caniggia has urged the current Argentina side not to be a one-man team in Russia this summer.The Argentines got their World Cup campaign under way on Saturday against Iceland but could only manage a draw.Today they face Croatia and will hope to kick-start their campaign.Caniggia went to three World Cups – almost returning for a fourth at the age of 42 in 2010 – and arrived to much fanfare at Dundee in 2000.He says his country’s best chance of winning it all for the first time since 1986 is if Lionel Messi’s supporting cast step up to the plate.The 51-year-old rose to international prominence during the 1990 World Cup in Italy alongside Argentina great Diego Maradona and insists the difference between that side and today’s is the expectation on the other players.Caniggia said: “Messi doesn’t get the same support from his team-mates Maradona did.“I knew Maradona was the complete footballing genius but I didn’t think about keeping up with him. Never.“Every player has a responsibility, even those who don’t play much.“You can’t give all the responsibility to Messi, because then what’s the point of you being there?“Imagine if I’d thought in 1990 the world champions had to carry me through. No! Carry us? We’re in it together.“I’m Argentina’s striker and I have to drag them through it, too.“That was my responsibility. You’ve got to have character, determination, ambition and impulse.”Argentina are fifth in the betting to lift the trophy and Caniggia believes they can do it, particularly with the talent they have up top.With Messi, Gonzalo Higuain – who has come under fire for his performances for his country – Sergio Aguero, Paulo Dybala and Angel Di Maria to choose from, goals shouldn’t be a problem. Defensively, however, they could come unstuck.“What’s in our favour is the best attacking players can put fear into anyone,” added Caniggia.“Their names alone unsettle the opposition. The other teams don’t think ‘Higuain is being criticised in Argentina’. They think: ‘he’s Juventus’ top goalscorer’.”“Our weak point is we’re still not solid at the back, and there are still a couple of places up for grabs.”Caniggia was in his early thirties by the time he arrived at Dens Park in 2000 and remarkably had the chance to play at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.“We’ll never know now but to play 30 minutes would have been perfect. I was in good shape and I hadn’t lost my pace. But I couldn’t decide, and later I regretted it. It would’ve been unbelievable to play.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/keepers-collage-300x180.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlo delighted as dundee united move to fix up giant goalkeepers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United have filled the void in the first line of their defence by fixing up two giant goalies from European football.With Harry Lewis back at Southampton after his year-long loan and Deniz Mehmet out for six months with a knee injury, it was no secret the Tangerines were in the market for goalkeepers.Now they’ve moved for Swiss goalie Benjamin Siegrist and Slovakian keeper Matej Rakovan. The pair, both of whom are 6ft 5in, have penned two-year deals.Now 26, Siegrist has played for Switzerland from U/17 to U/21 level and his list of previous employers include English trio Aston Villa, Cambridge and Wycombe.Most recently he’s been turning out for Lichtenstein outfit Vaduz in the Swiss Challenge League.Rakovan, 28, has U/21 caps for Slovakia and joins up from a spell in Czech football with FC Vysocina Jihlava, who he officially leaves tomorrow.“I am delighted to welcome Matej to the club,” said manager Csaba Laszlo“He has come through the excellent goalkeeping schools of Slovakia and the Czech Republic and is experienced at the top level.“He has had offers from other clubs and I am very pleased he has chosen us as he is ideally suited to the Scottish game.“Benjamin comes to Dundee United with a very good pedigree and is a large presence with good hands.”Austrian midfielder Christoph Rabitsch is also expected to join up this week, while former Celtic and Hearts striker Tony Watt is the latest name to be linked with a switch to the Tangerines.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a299edc22d-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee park to get 30k upgrade with new play equipment","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans for new play equipment at a prominent Dundee park have been revealed by the council.Dundee Decides was a project run by the local authority, giving residents the opportunity to decide how a £1.2 million Community Infrastructure Fund should be spent.The fund will be used to make improvements based upon suggestions identified during the Engage Dundee consultation.Each of the eight electoral wards was allocated up to £150,000 to spend on infrastructure improvements.In Strathmartine, one of four projects given the go ahead was a £30,000 upgrade to play equipment at Downfield Pavilion.A design statement – including an artist’s impression – has been released showing how the new equipment will look.A tower slide, balance beam, crawling pyramid, seesaw dolphin springer and balance poles are among the equipment which will be installed.Strathmartine councillor Kevin Keenan said he was confident the new playpark would benefit the local community.Mr Keenan, who is leader of the Labour group on the council, said: “This was one of the Dundee Decides projects, so people in the local community wanted it. The park itself is very well-used by local community groups and sports teams, so the equipment will be put to good use.“It’s good to see this sort of democratic process on a local level, and these individual projects being carried out with council funds voted for by the project.“I think, for kids who may be there for football training, the hope is that younger brothers and sisters will get the use of it.”The other winning projects in Strathmartine are to a refurbishment of Clatto Park toilets, and improvement to pavements on Beauly Avenue and Haldane

to don new robes when she picks up her degree on Friday.The 80-year-old Brechin grandmother said she would feel “incredibly proud” when she receives her diploma in higher education – an achievement that will rank among the most memorable in an exceptional life.It was her battle against endometrial cancer in 2014 that prompted her to return to education, determined to make the most of her “second chance”.She said: “There is no doubt that falling ill made me re-examine my life.“I had a wonderful surgeon at Ninewells who managed to remove my cancer and having that second chance made me think more about what I wanted to do with my life.“That’s when I started to think about studying at university.”Elisabeth soon found herself at the centre of student life and immersing herself in books in the university library.She served as a councillor in Angus from 1988-95, establishing herself as one of the foremost authorities on supporting people with drug and alcohol problems in the region, work for which she received an OBE in 2000.Before entering politics, she worked as a press officer at Glasgow’s Citizens Theatre in the 1960s.Keeping a very busy schedule, Elisabeth continues to work as

He is already OK and he wants to begin but I want him to take it a little bit easier because we want him for the long term, not two weeks.”Another of United’s long-term absentees from last term, James Keatings, will definitely be working with the rest of the squad right from the off tomorrow.The former Hearts and Hibs man has been out since early January because of a groin problem that required surgery.He’s been working over the summer, however, and is on course to be ready for the big kick-off next month.“Keatings is OK. Every second day he sends me a message saying I want to be training,” added Csaba.Still on the injury list are goalkeeper Deniz Mehmet and defender Lewis Toshney.Deniz will be out for several more months after his recent knee operation that followed the freak injury he suffered in the play-off win over Dunfermline last month, while Toshney’s condition will be assessed in the next week or so.He has yet to play under Csaba because of a knee problem that’s ruled him out since last October.“The one we don’t know how far on he is and is still in the recovery process is Toshney.“He’s made good steps forward but we have to see how the knee will react.”With eight new players and four fresh appointments to the coaching staff, there will be plenty new faces when the squad reports to their St Andrews training base tomorrow morning.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"evening tullygraph and dundee inspired clothing line to go on display","story":"\t\t\t\t\tArtwork which features the “Evening Tullygraph”, along with other designs inspired by Dundee, is being exhibited at a degree show this week.The work is by Tilly Longworth, an aspiring young fashion designer from Dundee who attends Robert Gordon University’s (RGU) Gray’s School of Art in Aberdeen.She will showcase her edgy clothing range, inspired by the city of Dundee, at the annual degree show.A spokesman for RGU said Tilly left Braeview Academy at 15 to pursue her creative dream, which led her to Gray’s School of Art, where she is set to graduate with a fashion and textiles degree.Some of her designs focus on well-known names within Dundee, such as the “Evening Tullygraph” and “Tilly Whizz”, a play on the local paper and the Beano’s Billy Whizz – a character which was created by her cartoonist uncle Vic Neill.Tilly said: “By the time I left college in 2014 I was sure fashion and textiles was the career path I wanted to take.“I was very interested in the grime music youths were listening to and the culture behind it.

building once visited by princess diana torn down","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAnother iconic building was lost from Dundee’s landscape this week.The Keiller Factory, which closed its doors for the final time in the early 1990s, has been demolished.It comes just a few weeks after the loss of Halley’s Mill on Broughty Ferry Road.Opening its doors more than 90 years ago on Mains Loan, Keiller went on to produce its famous marmalade.The site also produced confectionery including boiled sweets and butterscotch.Despite employing nearly 900 people during the 1950s, its final owners – Alma Holdings – went bust in March 1992 before the plant was sold off.It was revealed in 2015 that Dundee City Council had given approval for the former factory to be replaced by 131 new homes.Local residents have complained about the site having been plagued by intruders who illegally gained access to the disused grounds.Following a major blaze in July 2015, the building continued to fall further into a state of disrepair.However, in spite of its sad demise during the last two decades, the Maryfield plant leaves behind a legacy that once saw royalty crossing the threshold.Keiller was at one time the largest confectionary firm in Britain, as well as boasting eight bakery shops in the city.The factory was given the royal seal of approval three years after it opened in 1928.Keiller supplied King George V with marmalade and Queen Mary with chocolate by royal appointment in 1931.The Keiller estate on Mains Loan would go on to see further expansion with an additional factory space opened there in 1947.Immortalised as part of Dundee’s three Js – jute, jam and journalism – the Keiller business would change hands two more times before its demise.It was bought over by Nestle in 1961, then it was the turn of the Okhai Group in 1981.Connections with the royal family continued when Princess Diana visited the factory in 1983.The Princess of Wales was pictured donning the regulation white hat and Keiller-branded white coat while chatting to staff during her visit.Former employee Carol Glass, 53, worked in the wrapping department from 1983 to 1991 just before it closed.She said: “I remember Princess Diana visiting the factory and it was good to see her there.“We also had a visit from Margaret Thatcher though I can’t remember if that was before or after Diana.“Initially I didn’t want to work there and only had a three-month contract but I loved my time.“It was huge part of my life growing up and I remember speaking to some of the staff who’d worked in original Keiller Factory.“It was great hearing their old stories.“I remember during my time the place must have employed a few hundred folk.”Carol, who lived in Douglas at the time, added: “It was sad to see the area falling into such a state during recent years.“It would have great if they had been able to keep the facade of the buildings, but they said they couldn’t owing to the structural damage caused by the fire.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/09/57cfe1c2dde84-409x400.jpg ","title":"the tele guide to the world cup group hs local

world\u0026#8217s top sharpshooters in Robert Lewandowski, Senegal have Liverpool\u0026#8217s Sadio Mane while Japan might have a former United keeper between the sticks.The Tele looks at the final set of countries and how they \u0026#8211 some tenuously \u0026#8211 are linked to both city clubs.GROUP HColombiaAnother nation with a golden generation, much is expected of this Colombia side back home.Four years ago, led by talisman James Rodriguez, they entertained their way to the quarter-final where they lost out to hosts Brazil in controversial fashion.This time around they find themselves in a group of unfancied teams which could give them the platform for another run into the knockout stages.With players like James, Radamel Falcao, Juan Cuadrado and Tottenham’s Davinson Sanchez, they possess quality throughout the squad.Star player: James Rodriguez.Local link: Colombia were invited to take on Scotland and England in the 1988 Rous Cup and arrived in the UK with stars like Carlos Valderrama, Rene Higuita and the tragic Andres Escobar, who was later murdered after scoring an own goal at the 1994 World Cup.A Dundee United player at the time, Kevin Gallacher played the full 90 minutes at Hampden as the teams played out a 0-0 draw and Scotland finished third out of three.JapanA mainstay of recent World Cups, Japan are looking to repeat their appearances in the knockout rounds in 2002 and 2010 after failing to win a game in 2014.With the experienced Keisuke Honda helped by former Manchester United man Shinji Kagawa, Japan have the guile to open teams up for Leicester’s Shinji Okazaki to finish.Star player: Shinji Kagawa.Local link: Dundee United fans won’t have fond memories of him – Dundee fans might – but goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima goes into this World Cup with the No 1 jersey.Signed by Mixu Paatelainen at Tannadice, Kawashima signed to regain his place in the national side but failed to perform as the club suffered relegation.The 35-year-old now plays for French top-flight club Metz.PolandThe Poles sailed to qualification for this one through a tough group that included Denmark, Montenegro and Romania thanks to a record goals haul of 16 by Robert Lewandowski.When they do qualify for World Cups, Poland tend to do well with two third-place finishes to their name.Those came in 1974 and 1982 but they’ve not made it out of the group stage since 1986.With one of the most lethal finishers in the tournament, they could surprise a few.Star player: Robert Lewandowski.Local link: Impressive goalkeepers have been the main export to the city from Poland for United but two outfielders come to mind at Dens.Dariusz Adamczuk and Pietor Czachowski arrived at Dundee in 1993 but couldn’t prevent relegation – Adamczuk would be fondly remembered in his second spell, returning in 1996 before departing for Rangers in 1999. He played 11 times for Poland while Czachowski picked up 45 caps.The ‘Mad Monk’ Grzegorz Szamotulski, Lukasz Zaluska and Rado Cierzniak were all top goalies at Tannadice while Jaroslaw Fojut had a decent spell in 2014-15. They have 15 caps between them.SenegalJust their second appearance at a finals since they exploded on to the scene in 2002 by beating world champions France in the opener in South Korea.The West Africans would love to repeat their run to the last eight then and will fancy their chances of getting out of this group.Star player: Sadio Mane.Local link: French-born Morgaro Gomis played more than 200 games for Dundee United over two spells.Now 32, Gomis plays in Malaysia but picked up two international caps with Senegal in 2009 while at Tannadice.Yet again Scotland won’t be there but, with just one sleep until the big kick-off, all eyes are now firmly fixed on the World Cup in Russia.The action starts tomorrow when the hosts take on Saudi Arabia in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium.Tonight the Tele’s build up concludes with our lowdown on the final section, Group H, possibly the least fashionable of all the groups, hipsters apart.Trying not to leave you feeling too left out by the Tartan Army’s absence, we’ll also provide a local link, tenuous or otherwise, to each participating

It’s a fantastic opportunity for them.“The camaraderie between them was great, and they were working with the other schools that were there as well.“There was a real buzz.”The pupils didn’t feel like runaway winners during the competition, according to Gwen.She said: “They didn’t think they had won until their name was announced, so they were all shocked.“They worked really well as a team, and played to their strengths, which was great. Their behaviour was commendable.”Tony Scott, the Green Power ambassador at the Transport Museum, said: “It was a good day, we had to shorten the races because of the heavy rain, but it was a good day overall.“The kids really enjoyed the day as well.“I’m always surprised by how much the kids enjoy it, and they made memories that will last forever.“The most important thing is that it’s cross curricular, so if there’s a kid that’s not interested in the mechanical side, they can take part in something else, so it really does capture the whole curriculum across the school.”Tony believes that the event is “vital” for helping children understand STEM subjects. He said: “The kids get really engaged, so they’re doing schoolwork without having to do work.“It’s about getting them to do things that they don’t necessarily want to do.”A spokesman for the competition said: “We had the most teams ever participating with 40 schools attending.“Each school had their own unique take on their body work design and we would like to congratulate them as they each took part with great sportsmanship, despite the wet conditions.“It wouldn’t have been possible without our wonderful sponsor TAQA and their incredible volunteers.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"worlds most powerful turbines commissioned for new north sea wind farm use","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe world’s most powerful offshore wind turbines were commissioned yesterday and are now fully confirmed for use on the 100 turbine Moray (East) Wind Farm development, due to begin construction in 2022.MHI Vestas Offshore Wind said it had secured final certification for the “world’s most powerful available turbine”.The Moray Firth based wind project will include the supply and installation of 90 MHI Vestas V164-9.5 megawatt (MW) offshore wind turbine generators.The development is a joint venture company owned by EDP Renewables (77%) and ENGIE (23%).\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 20/05/18, 3:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.News of £36m funding to support walking and cycling announced by Transport Minister Humza Yousaf is to be welcomed, albeit part of an £80million funding pot already allocated.Far too often, we experience how sharing roads among pedestrians, cyclists and motorists leads to unwanted collisions that could have been prevented had the road conditions and visibility been better. Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

South Ayrshire councillors will launch a bid to scrap their own controversial rule, the Post can reveal. We told last week how the three-year-old policy is being labelled a threat to small businesses. Now councillors are ready to intervene in the row. Labour’s Phil Saxton, who represents Troon, is to table a motion before colleagues calling for a rethink.  He said: “The word we’re looking for here is compromise. “I don’t think the relevant detail was considered when this policy was first introduced. “The ability to enforce something like this will always be very difficult.” Cllr Saxton is now expected to lead calls for a ‘mixed’ smoking zone outside cafes or bars which use council-owned pavements. He said: “We could look at 50 per cent of the tables smoking and 50 per cent not. “I don’t think that’s an unreasonable solution. “Right now I’m looking at gathering support and hopefully the vote will go our way.”  That vote is scheduled to take place on June 28 when the council holds its last full meeting before the summer recess. It’s understood members are currently divided on the issue, which was introduced under the council’s last administration. The new move comes as the Post reported last week how furious cafe bosses said their business was under threat because of the “crazy”council law. Nino and Karen Pajovic insisted a smoking ban outside their Cafe Le Monde premises in Ayr was costing them thousands Said Nino: “A compromise along these lines would be perfect and is surely the common sense approach.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12385832.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_200317mackay_02JPG.jpg","title":"campaign save sanctity loans set","story":"NewsCampaign to save sanctity of Loans set to end in victoryFor the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet11:47, 15 JUN 2018NewsLand earmarked for housing in 2014 adjacent to Loans (Image: Euan McCall/Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA strong campaign to save the sanctity of the village of Loans is set to end in victory. Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads.

They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Glee as Melrose Primary choir raises the roof in Perth","story":"PERFORMING pupils from Melrose are officially amongst the best in Scotland.\nThe

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 -

Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches -

Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son. While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"United front to boost the Borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year.

This is a key part of our commitment to 100 percent coverage of deals across Scotland.\n\u0026ldquoWe want to see an ambitious deal that focuses on driving inclusive growth and the priorities that will make a difference and help the economy thrive.

Unless we act they will continue to suck up our young talent and skills.\n\u0026ldquoWe need to re-position ourselves, we need to stabilise and to stop our productivity falling and then we also need to reinvent. This feels like a once in a generation opportunity.\n\u0026ldquoWe know our potential, our children will not forgive us if there are no jobs in the future.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans.

Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.

Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington hosts world record attempt for the Slosh dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930043.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Calls to tackle Edinburgh Bypass gridlock as tram system to Musselburgh mooted","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS MSP has backed calls for improvements to the Edinburgh City Bypass \u0026ndash while suggesting extending a tram or light rail system to the Honest Toun.  Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.

It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality.

During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7954598.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Congress Republicans postpone key immigration vote","story":"              House Republican leaders have abruptly postponed voting on a compromise immigration measure amid ongoing infighting between conservative and moderates.

The findings are based on experiments carried out using air pollution monitors in various UK locations - including Busby in East Renfrewshire and East Kilbride in South Lanarkshire - to coincide with Clean Air Day.

The tests were conducted using air pollution monitors, called micro-Athelometers, attached to the back packs of children or carried at shoulder height by adults.  On average, the experiments found that children walking to school on a busy route were exposed to 2.5 times more pollution from petrol and diesel exhaust fumes than pupils on a quiet route, while youngsters were breathing in 30 per cent more particulates and nitrogen oxide fumes than the adults.

Now the sinister sight of cherry trees draped in eerie cobwebs is taking hold in Scotland after the beast from the east Siberian storm and recent heatwave created perfect conditions for the phenomenom.  Huge numbers of bird cherry ermine moth caterpillars has created the spectre in woodlands across the country as they spin elaborate webs to protect them from predators.  They feed on bird cherry trees which are found across Europe and when they emerge fully grown, they become distinctive white moths with five rows of black dots.  The larvae, which are about an inch long, make large communal silvery webs for protection and then feast on the surrounding leaves, stripping the trees bare.  There are eight species of ermine moths in this country and 2,400 species of moths in the British Isles and they usually pupate into adult moths in July or August.  The Woodland Trust Scotland has been receiving many reports of the ghostly looking trees in recent days with worried callers expressing alarm at the trees being stripped of all vegetation.  But the trees are not killed and will recover next year, by which time the caterpillars will have found somewhere else to spin their webs.  The Trust has received calls about outbreaks at Formonthills in Glenrothes and at its own Geordie\u0027s Wood at Glen Devon with the species enjoying a bumper year across many parts of the country.  George Anderson of the Trust said: \"Every few years this species explodes in numbers and they strip the host tree of its leaves. Trees normally recover the following year so it is not as drastic as it looks.  It does look very sinister as they drape entire trees in their silk. We have had some enquiries from people concerned that they were seeing oak processionary moth.  \"These are a real problem in the south of England and cause severe allergic reactions but thankfully they have not been found in Scotland. It is the bird cherry ermine moth we are seeing at the moment and it is entirely harmless.\"  The bird cherry moth, Latin name Yponomeuta evonymella, has a maximum wingspan of less than an inch and is found all over Europe.  There are hundreds of known species of ermine moths, and most of the time they go completely unnoticed.  But when it comes to spinning elaborate webs, no creature can match the power of ermine moth caterpillars. The behaviour is called \u0026ldquotenting, and only some species are able to manage it.  Every now and again, thousands of the tiny moths show up en masse and it is happening more frequently.  By working together, they are able to conceal themselves in a protective blanket. Like a giant invisibility cloak, the veil confuses birds and other predators well enough to keep them at bay while the caterpillars feed.  As the ermines move from tree to tree, they have to cover their tracks and so they keep their protection with them.  Over time everything in their path, from cars, to street signs, to grass, becomes shrouded in white, a scene which has been nicknamed the \u0026ldquowalk of ghosts.  One theory suggests that the super-webs form when multiple females lay their eggs on the same plant, in areas where food is scarce such as housing developments.  Other experts suggest that climate change is having an impact as the eggs tend to do better over warm and damp winters.  Experts believe that the sever storms which swept in from Siberia in March followed relatively shortly after by a prolonged heatwave has provided perfect conditions for the moths, while killing off their parasitic predators.  Tom Prescott, Senior Conservation Officer at Butterfly Conservation Scotland said: \"They are targeted by parasitic wasps and flies who enter their bodies and hatch out when the moths should and kill them off.  \"It\u0027s why they make this incredible web, they hope to keep the parasites and other predators out, it\u0027s like a very large disguise.  \"It just takes two or three to get inside the blanket for the moth numbers to be dramatically reduced, this is why some years there are lots of them, while in other years you can hardly see them.  \"We don\u0027t know for sure but the cold spell could have hit the parasites numbers while the recent warm spell has made it great for the caterpillars, one minute it was grey and overcast and the Spring and Summer both seemed to appear at once.  \"We have another species in Scotland, the Marsh Fritillary, which spins similar webs to protect it from its only known parasite, but there are smaller numbers of them and its population fluctuates much more from year to year.  \"But in truth, we don\u0027t really understand everything about the bird cherry ermine months and the webs but it can certainly put on a show\"."},{"url":null,"title":"SNP    39 No rope strong enough  39  to hold Scotland to UK under   39 cliff edge  39  Brexit","story":"              There is \"not a rope in existence that is strong enough\" to hold Scotland to the rest of the UK if the Government pursues a \"cliff edge\" Brexit, the SNP\u0027s Europe spokesman has warned.

The then prime minister sheltered from torrential downpours in a cottage belonging to his wife Samantha\u0026rsquos millionaire stepfather.  At least that is what newspaper reports said. In fact, the whitewashed lodge where the Camerons and their three children hid from the weather was part of a 20,000-acre estate formally owned by a firm registered in the Bahamas.  The Scottish Government on Wednesday announced detailed proposals to try to expose the true owners of land - rather than untraceable firms at PO Boxes in the Caribbean or Channel Islands.  In a statement, the government said it wanted to create a register which, if agreed, would \u0026ldquoreveal for the first time the controlling interests of land owned by trusts and overseas companies.  Land reform minister Roseanna Cunningham added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos no longer acceptable for the identity of people making decisions about land in Scotland to be obscured. Our proposals go further than any existing UK legislation. We\u0026rsquore putting Scotland at the forefront of this policy in Europe.  Scotland\u0026rsquos currently opaque property registry - title searches are expensive and often end with a secretive tax haven address - means it is far from clear how much of the country is owned offshore.  The Sunday Post earlier this year said some \u0026pound2.9 billion worth of land was held by 776 companies registered in 22 secrecy jurisdictions.  The BBC this year checked the land registry of England and Wales and found nearly 100,000 properties registered offshore, a quarter of them in the British Virgin Islands.  Land campaigner Andy Wightman - who exposed the offshore ownership of the Camerons\u0026rsquo holiday home on Jura - reckons 750,000 acres of Scotland is owned in tax havens. Foreign investors have been buying up prime Edinburgh real estate, including property close to Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos official residence, Bute House.

Transparency want England and Wales to follow suit.  Mr Wightman also welcomed the move but struck a note of caution after his 20-year-battle for transparency. He said: \u0026ldquoThis new Register will be helpful but it will not be definitive as it relies on self-declaration and will be impossible to verify the true owners based in offshore secrecy jurisdictions.    Roseanna Cunningham  Ms Cunningham said access to the register would be free. Mr Wightman warned that information to which beneficial ownership details would relate to would still be behind a paywall.  Scotland\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquobig land\u0026rsquo lobby said it was supportive of transparency moves. Sarah-Jane Laing, executive director of Scottish Land \u0026amp Estates, said: \u0026ldquoWe fully appreciate that transparency and visibility of ownership is an area where improvement is required and we led the way in publishing our Landowners\u0026rsquo Commitment in 2014 which urged landowners to be open and visible. \u0026ldquo She said her body would review regulations to ensure they are \u0026ldquoboth proportionate and workable  However, the SNP still faces robust opposition on wider reform from vested interests. These include those of Mrs Cameron\u0026rsquos stepfather, Viscount Astor, whose family has effectively owned the Jura estate for nearly century and who has described the beneficial owners of the property as his children.  The hereditary peer, whose full name is William Waldorf Astor III, in 2015 accused the SNP of threatening \u0026ldquoMugabe-style land grabs on landowners. That, said a spokesman for Ms Sturgeon, was \u0026ldquopretty preposterous.  Analysis from Malcom Combe, Law Lecturer, Aberdeen University  \"Land registration is not new to Scotland. The current Land Register was introduced in 1979, and prior to that there was a system of deeds registration that went back to the 17th century.  \"What is happening now \u0026ndash in line with what was provided for in 2016 Land Reform Act -\u0026nbsp is to have a register of who controls a relevant entity that owns land, much like letting agent registration has emerged in the private rented sector.    Malcolm Combe  \"The hope is that this will increase accountability of owners, or at the very least open up channels of communication, which would otherwise have been tricky in situations where, say, the only details of a landowner was an overseas registered office.  \"Interestingly, the draft regulations set out that knowingly or recklessly failing to comply with the information duties that will be associated with the new register will be a criminal offence.  The maximum penalty for those offences is a fine not exceeding \u0026pound5,000, although the stigma of an offence is perhaps the greater penalty. There will be some tricky issues to navigate though, such as how to operate the rules for local trusts or clubs.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Pay hike    absorbs      50m college merger savings","story":"              ALL of the savings generated by a Scotland-wide college merger programme will be \u0026lsquoabsorbed\u0026rsquo by higher wages for lecturers, according to public spending watchdogs.  Audit Scotland suggested the costs of pay harmonisation across the sector - which will see lecturers paid a top salary of more than \u0026pound40,000 - will match the estimated \u0026pound50 million annual windfall from mergers.  The report goes on to highlight a number of financial risks facing colleges including a \u0026pound360m repairs backlog, revealed in December, and the impact of Brexit.  Auditors also noted the attainment gap between rich and poor students is growing despite a national campaign to close it.  Overall the report found the sector\u0026rsquos financial position had improved in 2016/17 with an overall surplus of \u0026pound0.3m compared to an \u0026pound8m deficit last year.  However, five colleges are still in deficit including New College Lanarkshire, Edinburgh, Ayrshire, Dundee \u0026amp Angus and North Highland.  The report said: \u0026ldquoStaff costs remain the highest area of spending and are forecast to increase, mainly as a result of the costs associated with harmonising pay and other conditions.  \u0026ldquoColleges Scotland has estimated the total cost of harmonisation as \u0026pound50m a year from 2019/20.  \u0026ldquoThis would absorb all the \u0026pound50m of annual financial savings the Scottish Government ... expected the reform programme to deliver.  In 2015 Audit Scotland said there was no evidence the 2011/12 merger programme - which saw the number of colleges fall from 37 to 20 - had improved education or produced savings.  When the plans were announced, ministers said mergers would deliver \u0026pound50m annual efficiency savings and bring other benefits such as reduced duplication and better outcomes for students.  Shona Struthers, chief executive of Colleges Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe report notes significant elements of financial uncertainty for colleges, including ongoing costs of national bargaining.  \u0026ldquoColleges are working in partnership to ensure adequate sustainable funding ... to continue to deliver benefits.  Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland, questioned the figures.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have not seen any evidence to support these claims ... and would question the basis upon which these comments have been made.  \u0026ldquoThe 2015 Audit Scotland report itself challenged how much of the estimated \u0026pound50m could actually be attributable to college reform.  Iain Gray, education spokesman for Scottish Labour, said the report highlighted the \u0026ldquolack of support colleges received.  And Liz Smith, education spokeswoman for the Scottish Conservatives, attacked the \u0026ldquoout of control repair bill.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos going to be difficult for colleges to teach and educate if their buildings are not in an adequate condition.  Shirley-Anne Somerville, the further education minister, said the report showed colleges were in better financial health with student satisfaction higher than last year.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis progress is supported by significant government investment of more than \u0026pound7 billion since 2007.  John Kemp, interim chief executive of the Scottish Funding Council, said: \u0026ldquoThe report highlights some areas for improvement and we are working with the sector to address these."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7952233.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Burger King says sorry for a whopper of a World Cup pregnancy ad blunder","story":"              Burger King Russia has apologised for a promotion which offered Russian women Whoppers and cash for getting pregnant by World Cup players.

Here\u0027s our writers\u0027 choices - now we want to know yours.  Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989  Just seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. Over 25 years, it has offered me endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Heaven and Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990  There were few exotic sounds in early 1990s Glenrothes, but Liz Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack soaring from my bedroom from was one of them. This most accessible of the Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is awash with blissed-out grandeur, each exquisite track creating a world all of its own.  High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983  Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth, and reimagined them as the perfectly-crafted jangle-heavy creations he gave to the world. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  Marianne Taylor  Hope Is Important, Idlewild, 1998  Before they went all REM, Woomble and co produced this startling explosion of singalong hooks, soft-loud dynamics and crashing guitars with one song (A Film For The Future) that could sum up manic pop rock thrills for aliens.  Django Django, Django Django, 2012  Their insatiable rockabilly-tinged surf rock is a staple on my playlist and while the latest album has two of their best tunes, their Mercury-nominated debut was the real eyeopener.    Architect, C Duncan, 2015  The debut bedroom-produced, genre-hopping classical-meets-dream pop meets-space folk, featuring harmonies straight out of The Carpenters songbook, remains an ear-opening wonder that deserved to win the Mercury.  Martin Williams  City to City, Gerry Rafferty, 1978.  Not so much for the two big hits, Baker Street and Right Down the Line, but more for Whatever\u0026rsquos Written in Your Heart. Rafferty at his introspective best.  Listen to City to City  A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984  Tinseltown in the Rain, of course, from the band\u0026rsquos debut album. There\u0026rsquos Killermont Street by Aztec Camera but Tinseltown is the ode to Glasgow.  On Stolen Stationary, Michael Marra, 1991  Hermless. Marra at his witty best. The ultimate self-effacing anthem for our national football team. Such mischievous fun, too.  Barclay McBain  Treasure, The Cocteau Twins, 1984  I was a devout follower of John Peel\u0026rsquos radio show, a late-night portal to a different dimension and it was here I first heard the strange, ethereal, beguiling sounds of Liz Fraser and the Cocteau Twins, beamed through into my bedroom and my brain, like the best alien invasion ever. Not only was Liz from Earth, however, she was from Grangemouth, just down the road. After 30-odd years of listening, I still have absolutely no idea what she\u0026rsquos singing about, nor do I care. Just turn it up and let me dream.  Songs from Northern Britain, Teenage Fanclub, 1997  A long, long time ago, at a festival not too far from here, a man thrust a microphone in my face and asked me what Teenage Fanclub meant to me. In the second it took me to open my mouth to reply, they vanished. Collecting my thoughts from the comfort of a chemical toilet, I mused on the question. They are the band equivalent of your best friend, a constant. Always there, always dependable, the soundtrack to your greatest triumphs and most crushing defeats, they have your back, always ready with a smile and a hug. Cheers, pals.    The Three EPS, The Beta Band, 1998  Ok, so technically not an album, but three EPs gathered together for your listening pleasure. When John Cusack\u0026rsquos character in the film High Fidelity puts the Three Eps in his record shop, customers stop in their tracks. What\u0026rsquos this? they ask, \u0026ldquoit\u0026rsquos good! To which Cusack replies, smugly, I know. If only everyone did.  Lian Thomson  Sulk, The Associates, 1982  Of course, as any fool knows, 1982 is the annus mirabilis of Scottish pop (the fact that I was 19 that year may or may not be related). Above all else there was Sulk, the highpoint of new pop (alongside ABC\u0026rsquos Lexicon of Love), and Dundee\u0026rsquos finest gift to the culture. Alan Rankine and Billy McKenzie made pop music that was wilder, stranger and, yes, sexier, than everyone else that year. Party Fears Two is a song that is a song that teeters on the cusp of madness and is giddy at the very thought of it. It\u0026rsquos not even the best thing on the album.  Bones You Have Thrown Me and Blood I\u0026rsquove spilled, Kathryn Joseph, 2015  Because I believe every word she sings.  I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, Trashcan Sinatras, 1993  Presuming that Lloyd Cole\u0026rsquos Commotion-less albums don\u0026rsquot qualify (if they did, then Don\u0026rsquot Get Weird on Me would be a shoo-in), let\u0026rsquos go with the second album from Ayrshire\u0026rsquos finest exports. I\u0026rsquom not sure it\u0026rsquos better than their precocious debut Cake, but the bittersweet autumnal yearning of Earlies is the most gorgeous Scottish song no one has heard of.  Teddy Jamieson  This Is The Story, The Proclaimers, 1987  Its seminal track Letter From America was a soaring cry of solidarity for beleaguered working class communities across Scotland. The line \u0026ldquoBathgate no more \u0026ndash referring to the British Leyland plant which closed in 1984 \u0026ndash made this West Lothian youngster feel like someone was listening.  Listen to\u0026nbspLetter from America:\u0026nbsp  Popped In Souled Out, Wet Wet Wet, 1987  Ah, heady gems such as Wishing I Was Lucky, Angel Eyes and Sweet Little Mystery crooned by dreamboat Marti Pellow (err, what? I was nine). I played this album so often that the tape inside the cassette stretched and snapped. I saved up my pocket money and bought another.  The Hush, Texas, 1999  It was the soundtrack to my first newspaper job as a trainee reporter at the Basingstoke Gazette, the smoky-voiced tones of Sharleen Spiteri \u0026ndash singing Summer Son and In Our Lifetime \u0026ndash played through the tinny headphones of my Sony Discman.    Susan Swarbrick  All You Need Is\u0026hellip.Love and Money, Love and Money, 1986  Because it was the first album I ever owned (on cassette) because I loved James Grant\u0026rsquos voice and because it was a bit edgy and angry and I wasn\u0026rsquot either of those things, normally. It made me feel a bit dangerous.  Fruits of Passion, Fruits of Passion, 1987  A sadly-neglected pure pop classic \u0026ndash why oh why, did this wonderful band get left behind when the likes of Texas, Deacon Blue and Del Amitri soared? Pure, perfect vocals and singalong joy.  Listen to Kiss Me Now  Creeping up on Jesus, The Big Dish, 1988  I know it wasn\u0026rsquot as well received as their first album, Swimmer, but I always liked the happy, poppy feel of this one and it reminds me of driving around the north of Scotland in the summer sunshine with my love, when we were young and free as birds\u0026hellip  Ann Fotheringham  Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991  It was not their first album, but Bandwagonesque thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is this Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  The Beta Band, The Three Eps, 1998  Though technically a compilation, this laid out their manifesto more than any album from this cult Scots combo \u0026ndash a gloriously languid, ramshackle assembly of loose, off-kilter tunes, embroidered with hints of funk and electronica. They have never sounded better.  Music Has The Right To Children, Boards of Canada, 1998  The debut album of Scots electronic duo Boards of Canada is, for many, the high watermark for ambient electronic music. Two decades on from its release, its influence continues to be recognised and celebrated \u0026ndash and rightly so.  Scott Wright  Screamadelica, Primal Scream, 1991  It sounded in 1991 like it was made in the future and in 2018 it could have been recorded yesterday. Movin\u0026rsquo on Up really ought to be the national anthem. Stands out on its own.  Listen to Loaded  Grand Prix, Teenage Fanclub, 1995  Bellshill meets the US West Coast with predictably dreamy results. There is not a weak track on it and some of the lyrics would make a statue well up.  Psychocandy, The Jesus and Marychain, 1985  It wasn\u0026rsquot all madness and fighting in the Reid family. This album sees them flirt with the Beach Boys and, pun intended, they pull it off. Just Like Honey is perfection.  Neil Cameron  The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008  A decision to avoid albums detailing the painful end of a long-term relationship after the end of my own stopped me listening to Midnight Organ Fight for a few years, but diving back in was like meeting an old friend in the pub. It\u0026rsquos painful but cathartic. Like all of the late Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.  I Am An Island, Fatherson, 2014  My first experience of drinking alcohol was at a Fatherson gig in our hometown of Kilmarnock circa 2009, so their music has always been riddled with nostalgia for me. Their debut album is special because it taps into that difficult phase of growing up in, and moving out of, a small town that can sometimes feel desperate to pull you back.  The Bones of What You Believe, Chvrches, 2013  The juxtaposition of pop melodies and dark lyrics is the USP of this album, which can be appreciated on both a surface level and deeper, with every move having been intricately created by the three musicians. Lauren Mayberry brings a new a level of vulnerability to the genre which makes Chvrches stand out from the rest.  Holly Lennon  Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989  Heartache, the joy of human connection and a love letter to rainy Glasgow by night from a voice wrought with emotion. I\u0026rsquom forever grateful to my brother, Ewen, for the first hearing of the Downtown Lights, beyond his bedroom door.  Garbage, Garbage, 1995  Thrilling soundtrack to the giddy, alcohol-fuelled anticipation of student nights out, sung by the first cool ginger frontwoman I had ever seen.  These Streets, Paolo Nutini, 2006  The ache of leaving home and impermanence of first love refreshingly articulated in Nutini\u0026rsquos Paisley brogue with a maturity beyond his years.    Caroline Wilson  Solid Air, John Martyn, 1973  Superb guitar playing, great songs and Martyn\u0026rsquos trademark slurred jazzy vocals make this a fascinating album, like nothing we\u0026rsquod ever heard before. Martyn had star quality and talent in abundance but he also had a self-destructive streak and simply did what he liked, on and off stage, and never made the \u0026ldquobig time. He made other great albums, notably One World, but this is him at his peak.  Listen to Solid Air  White Album, Average White Band, 1974  Great songs, astonishing double lead vocal from Alan Gorrie and Hamish Stuart, fabulous funky drumming from Robbie McIntosh and the Dundee Horns of Ball on Pick Up The Pieces, this topped both the UK and US charts. Black American artists couldn\u0026rsquot believe the band were white, never mind Scottish, when they heard it. Still a classic 44 years on.  Sunshine on Leith, The Proclaimers, 1988  A clutch of superb self-written songs, the Reid twins singing in their own accents (very unusual back then), a great session band and Pete Wingfield\u0026rsquos sensitive production turned this into a classic. Hell, they even made a musical and film based on it. Thirty years on and we\u0026rsquore still singing along with the choruses.  Frank Morgan  Exploited, Troops of Tomorrow, 1982  \u0026ldquoSomething\u0026rsquos happened/what\u0026rsquos gone wrong/Going down the dole/got to sign on/Millions of kids with nowt to do/You better watch out they\u0026rsquore after you. It\u0026rsquos 1982, the country is falling apart and Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Wattie Buchan and Big John Duncan have the perfect response. Fast, angry, hardcore punk.  Twilight Sad, Forget the Night Ahead, 2009  An uncompromising post-rock wall of sound, with uncompromising Scottish accents. Like nothing I\u0026rsquod heard before. What The Proclaimers would sound like if they were a Chem19 band channelling Nine Inch Nails.  Test Dept, Brith Gof, Gododdin, 1989  Pipes and drums and tribal soul \u0026ndash this was the sound of Europe\u0026rsquos ancient minorities refusing to fade away. Angus Farquhar\u0026rsquos finest musical moment before coming a full-time arts revolutionary with NVA.  Garry Scott  I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, Trashcan Sinatras, 1993  From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  Avocet, Bert Jansch, 1979  One for the diaspora. Released as punk morphed into post-punk and new wave, the Edinburgh-born guitarist\u0026rsquos 12th studio album came from another world entirely. Around the theme of wading birds he weaves a fabric of folk, jazz and improvised playing that never loses its capacity to enthral.  Bones You Have Thrown Me and Blood I\u0026rsquove Spilled, Kathryn Joseph, 2015  Irrefutable evidence that the best music doesn\u0026rsquot belong to the distant past, Glasgow-based Aberdonian Kathryn Joseph\u0026rsquos hard-won success with her debut was fuelled in equal measure by her powerfully emotional music, glorious enthusiasm and unwillingness to mask the fact that when you reach 40 there\u0026rsquos some baggage you either can\u0026rsquot or don\u0026rsquot want to leave behind, so best use it to stoke the fire of creativity.

Mr Yousaf met with Common Weal earlier this year \u0026ndash just months before he is due to make an announcement on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos plans for a public sector bid to take over the railways.  He initiated the meeting with the left-wing \u0026ldquothink and do tank to discuss a paper it produced with the transport union TSSA, which also suggested creating a unified public transport body for Scotland\u0026rsquos buses, trains, trams and ferries.  The document, entitled A Public Future for Scotland\u0026rsquos Railways, argues the current franchise system should be abolished to prevent the railways being taken back into private ownership if a public bid takes over.  It states: \u0026ldquoWhile the system of tendering out time-limited contracts for operating Scotland\u0026rsquos railways remains, even the most popular and efficient public-sector operator will suffer from the lack of certainty which inhibits long-term thinking in the railways today, as it would face the very real prospect of losing its right to operate the franchise every five to ten years.  \u0026ldquoIn order to allow us to enjoy the full rewards publicly-run railways have the potential to bring, the Scottish Government should seek the power to abolish the franchise system, and instead allow ScotRail to be operated permanently on a public-sector basis.  The paper argues \u0026ldquomuch of the transformative potential of the idea of publicly-run railways in Scotland relies on it being a permanent break with decades of privatisation and market-oriented policy.  It references the InterCity East Coast franchise, which was run by a state-owned operator between 2009 and 2015, and argues a publicly-owned rail company could make substantial cuts to ticket prices.  It also suggests three governance models: a new public arm\u0027s-length rail company, a unified public transport body, or a co-operative partially owned by workers and passengers.  In an entry on Holyrood\u0026rsquos lobbying register, Common Weal writes: \u0026ldquoWe were asked to provide our advice and opinion on [the] plans and to offer suggestions as to what other aspects of the recommendations in our paper could be prioritised.  Dr Craig Dalzell, head of policy and research at the think tank, said Mr Yousaf had been interested in \u0026ldquothe report in the round.  The transport minister is currently preparing a bid to take over the railways, with a statement on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos plans due within days.  A public-sector bid by state-owned ferry operator CalMac is understood to be one of the favoured options.  But current operator Abellio has repeatedly said it would have \"no problem competing with a public bid\".  Scottish Tory transport spokesman Jamie Greene said the meeting with Common Weal \u0026ldquoshould send alarm bells ringing.  He said: \u0026ldquoSeeking views of this type simply signals that instead of just pushing for a public operator to run our railways, the transport minister is in fact open to full monopolised nationalisation, at any cost.  He added: \u0026ldquoTenders and franchises offer a transparent process which get the best available operator at the best cost to the public purse.  A Transport Scotland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoOur consistent view over many years is that there ought to be a level playing field between the private and public sector in bidding for rail franchises.  \u0026ldquoIt is vital that we take the time to think through the various scenarios as ministers want to enable a competitive public sector bid which offers best value for the public purse while delivering continuous service improvements. We expect to give an update on this over the coming weeks.\""},{"url":null,"title":"MSPs demand urgent overhaul of economic strategy","story":"              MSPs have demanded an urgent overhaul of the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos economic strategy.

She said: \u0026ldquoUnder the Nationalists, growth has been significantly lower than the rest of the UK and other small European countries, wages are stagnant and productivity is flat lining.  \u0026ldquoIt is increasingly clear that the SNP government is in denial about its mismanagement.

It said the end of free movement and a tighter immigration regime would see such workers try other EU nations and English-speaking countries such as the US and Australia.  The researchers at Glasgow and Edinburgh universities also warned a lack of joined up thinking by the UK Government meant the fate of such workers was being overlooked.  While there had been work on maintaining the flow of high-skill and seasonal workers, little was being done on maintaining adequate numbers of key low-skill workers all year round.  There was a particular failure to plan to Scotland\u0026rsquos rural areas and its demographic needs, with a growing elderly population requiring more care workers.  There are around 128,000 EU nationals working in Scotland, 5 per cent of the workforce.  The Scottish Government said the report showed the need for Holyrood to control migration.  The report, Choices Ahead: Approaches to lower skilled labour migration after Brexit, found a shift to more restrictive migration system was likely \u0026ldquoto have substantial effects on the supply of EEA [European Economic Area] nationals into lower-skilled jobs.  Some Scottish sectors were particularly reliant of EU nationals, with more than a fifth of basic cleaners and food processors from the continent.  There were also lesser concentrations in manufacturing, hotels and restaurants, and finance.  It recommended policy makers \u0026ldquobalance a range of labour market, demographic and social goals in developing policies to regulate low-skilled migration, and consider how changes would affect the decisions of would-be migrants on mobility and settlement.  It said: \u0026ldquoWhatever programme is adopted, the UK and Scotland will have to compete with other countries as potential migrant destinations. For EEA nationals, other countries within the EEA will become attractive alternatives. Other English-speaking countries (USA, Canada or Australia) with more complex entry requirements may also begin to emerge as more attractive destinations, especially for younger migrants with good English-language skills.\u0026rsquo  \u0026ldquoSuch restricted rights programmes are likely to be far less appealing to EEA nationals.  Co-author Professor Rebecca Kay, of Glasgow University\u0026rsquos School of social and Political Studies, added: \u0026ldquoEach year thousands of European nationals fill lower-skilled job vacancies in many UK industries like agriculture and care work. Many have stayed longer-term, raising families and contributing to their local communities.  \u0026ldquoPolicy makers designing new immigration policy must consider the varied needs of these workers and the attractiveness of the UK as a destination.  \u0026ldquoPolicy design will impact both on our ability to attract migrant workers at all, and on the types of migrants who are willing to come to, or settle in our country.  External affairs secretary Fiona Hyslop said: \u0026ldquoThis report clearly sets out the potentially catastrophic impact to Scotland\u0026rsquos business and communities of the UK Government\u0026rsquos migration policies. This cannot be an acceptable scenario and makes it all the more important, as the deadline of the UK leaving the EU draws closer, that we have the powers to set a migration policy tailored to Scotland\u0026rsquos specific needs and circumstances.  Green MSP Ross Greer said: \u0026ldquoThe scale of the task Scotland faces in attracting European nationals is laid bare in this report. It outlines how other English speaking countries and other countries in the EEA will become \u0026lsquomore attractive destinations\u0026rsquo than Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWorse still, families with young children, looking for a new home for the long-term, will be deterred by a \u0026lsquomore restrictive system\u0026rsquo.

The figure was more than twice the \u0026pound191m underspend of the year before.  Announcing the outturn figure for 2017-18, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay told MSPs the fiscal budget had been \u0026pound31.4bn, but expenditure \u0026pound30.9bn.  However he stressed most of the unspent money was already committed, including \u0026pound100m for a new social security system, and all the money would be spent by the Scottish Government, not returned to the Treasury.  He said that for the second year running, income from devolved taxes was up, with total provisional income from Land \u0026amp Buildings Transactions Tax and Scottish Landfill Tax reaching \u0026pound706m, \u0026pound50m above forecasts, and \u0026pound73 million, or 12 per cent, up on 2016-2017.  He said that the net extra being carried forward into 2018/19 was \u0026pound66m, or just 0.2 per cent of the overall fiscal budget, and that this would be done through the Scotland Reserve pot, making it available \u0026ldquoto support management of future budget volatility.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe 2017-18 provisional outturn results show that once again the Scottish Government has prudently and competently managed Scotland\u0026rsquos finances.  \u0026ldquoUnder the current devolution settlement, the Scottish Parliament is not permitted to overspend its budget. As a consequence, we have consistently adopted a position of controlling public expenditure to ensure we live within the budget control limits that apply.  \u0026ldquoThese underspends represent a fraction of our overall budget, but will be carried forward to support this year\u0026rsquos budget and increase our reserves.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue to maintain a firm grip on Scotland\u0026rsquos public finances to mitigate the negative impact Brexit will have on Scotland\u0026rsquos economic outlook.  Labour MSP James Kelly said the underspend was \u0026ldquonothing short of a scandal, given ministers had cut \u0026pound1.5bn from councils since 2011, and demanded Mr Mackay apologise to workers facing the axe while he sat on an \u0026ldquoSNP government slush fund.  He said: \u0026ldquoMoney is piling up in his slush fund for his annual bribe to win Green votes to get his budgets passed.  \u0026ldquoThis is simply a gross mismanagement of the Scottish finances by a Finance Secretary who is clearly out of his depth. Derek Mackay must apologise to communities across Scotland that have been damaged by his reckless actions.  Tory Murdo Fraser added: \u0026ldquoDerek Mackay might like to fool us all into thinking this \u0026pound453m underspend figure is an insignificant sum.

Emily Thornberry was famously sacked from the Labour front bench in 2014 for a tweet apparently sneering at a white van driver\u0027s display of the cross of St George on his house months after the last World Cup.  But she sought to repair relations with the nation\u0027s fans by offering the prospect of a day off to nurse hangovers the morning after an appearance by England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland in the final game of the tournament.  And she called on the Royal Mail to \"reconsider\" its decision to ban postmen from flying the flag on their vans.  She admitted she was not herself a fan of the game - and proved her point by going on to suggest the World Cup came round \"every five years\" - but insisted she did not think there was anything wrong with supporters displaying the flag.  \"I think one of the things about the World Cup is that we do get lots of flags out and I think that there\u0027s nothing wrong with that,\" she said.  \"If it\u0027s true, these reports we are hearing from the Royal Mail, I do hope that they reconsider because I think that there is no problem with this at all. This is a time for us to celebrate.\"  Ms Thornberry\u0027s comments came at a speech to journalists at a Westminster lunch, where she was greeted with a display of England flags laid on by reporters who were not about to let her forget the biggest gaffe of her political career.  But a smiling Islington South MP took the joke on the chin, telling reporters that in her north London constituency there were all sorts of flags on show during the World Cup.  \"I can\u0027t pretend that I have the greatest interest in football, and I suspect that there\u0027s quite a lot of people like that,\" she said.  \"But I tell you how you could get more interest in football. What about if the Government were to suggest, for example, that if one of the nations of the United Kingdom were to get into the finals... the next day will be a bank holiday?  \"Why don\u0027t we do that every five years and that would help to get everybody behind whichever team it was?\"  Ms Thornberry branded Theresa May a serial liar as she issued an impassioned plea for more honesty in politics.  She said she would personally be ready to take TV presenter Richard Madeley\u0027s \"three strikes and you\u0027re out\" challenge of having an interview shut down if she did not give a straight answer - as happened to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson last month.  Ms Thornberry said there had been an \"increasing normalisation of dishonesty in modern politics\", citing the rise of US President Donald Trump as a sign that even the most senior politicians are now ready to say things they know to be untrue.  \"This normalisation of dishonesty has also crept into all sides of British politics, in part I believe as a result of the debate around Brexit,\" she said.  She named the European Research Group of Tory backbenchers and the pro-EU Back Together group of MPs, who she said were each engaged in \"earnest debate\" about how to get the best Brexit deal, when in fact one side wanted no deal and the other did not want to leave the EU at all.  And she added: \"Just look at the Prime Minister who, in the space of one interview last Sunday, claimed that she would fund a \u0026pound20 billion boost on NHS spending primarily through the \u0027Brexit dividend\u0027.  \"She claimed that the Brexit transitional period would definitely finish at the end of 2020. She claimed that she had not misled Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry on the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 amendment.  \"And after all that she had the sheer chutzpah to say - and I quote - that she is a woman of her word.\"  Ms Thornberry said: \"When it comes to what Jeremy (Corbyn) has called straight-talking honest politics and the kind of approach I\u0027ve outlined today, that does mean setting your standards high.  \"And, yes, it means we will fail those standards from time to time and we will be criticised and mocked as a result. But I would far rather that than having no standards at all.  Answering questions from Westminster journalists, Ms Thornberry declined three times to discuss allegations that Labour general secretary Jennie Formby was previously a member of Militant, insisting she did not know if that was the case.  And said she had smoked cannabis \"a long time ago\", but no longer thought it should be legalised for recreational use."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7957319.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Scots hotel adds midge burgers  delicacy  to the menu as  a bit of fun ","story":"              A SCOTS hotelier has claims to have created a burger from midges which has he describes as a \"delicacy\" that has proved surprisingly popular with guests.

A new study found those with the neurological disorder had twice the levels of two strains of herpes, HHV-6A and HHV-7, than those without the condition.  The research, published in journal Neuron, offers \"the most compelling evidence ever\" pointing to a possible viral trigger for Alzheimer\u0027s, the authors said.  Experts stressed it was not clear if the viruses caused dementia or were caused by it.  The study, using evidence from post-mortem brain tissue, was carried out by researchers from Mount Sinai Health System in New York in the US.  Lead author Dr Joel Dudley said: \"If it becomes evident that specific viral species directly contribute to an individual\u0027s risk of developing Alzheimer\u0027s or their rate of progression once diagnosed, then this would offer a new conceptual framework for understanding the emergence and evolution of Alzheimer\u0027s at individual, as well as population, levels.\"  Sam Gandy, professor of neurology and psychiatry, and co-author of the study, said: \"This is the most compelling evidence ever presented that points to a viral contribution to the cause or progression of Alzheimer\u0027s.\"  Studies have previously suggested that viruses might be linked with Alzheimer\u0027s but the new research suggests a relationship between viruses and the activity of genes associated with the disease.  Dr James Pickett, head of research at Alzheimer\u0027s Society, said: \"The relationship between viruses and Alzheimer\u0027s disease has been an area of interest for researchers for a while, but it is still unclear if higher levels of viruses cause dementia or are caused by it.\"  Dr David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer\u0027s Research UK, said the viruses highlighted in the study were not the same as those that caused cold sores.  Instead they were much more common forms which most people carried, usually without any problems.  He added: \"While the findings indicate a link between the activity of these viruses and Alzheimer\u0027s, they don\u0027t tell us whether they contribute to the development of the disease, help the brain to cope with the disease, or just occur alongside Alzheimer\u0027s processes without having an impact on the health of the brain.\""},{"url":null,"title":"FMQs sketch  Sun  sea and sarcasm","story":"              THE summer slump has come early to FMQs.

He was unhappy about tests for five year olds. \u0026ldquoFive year olds, he kept repeating to annoy the teacher, not unlike, well, a three-year-old.

But visiting the Royal Highland Show in Edinburgh, Mr Gove said: \"I think they\u0027re taking a leaf out of our book.  \"They understand that life outside the European Union means you can remove some bureaucracy from the lives of farmers, and that has to be a good thing.\"  He insisted the UK Government\u0026rsquos consultation on the future of farming had been very well received, adding: \" I think [that] suggests the path that we want to take agriculture south of the border is one that\u0027s got universal support.  \"Here in Scotland we respect the fact there is a devolved administration that will make its own decisions, but it\u0027s encouraging that the direction of travel the Scottish Government wants to take is one that\u0027s following in our footsteps.\"  Mr Gove also pledged that Scottish farmers would always receive \u0026ldquospecial treatment because they face unique challenges.  He was questioned about a long-anticipated review into the distribution of EU farm subsidies between Scotland and the rest of the UK, amid claims Scottish hill farmers are owed \u0026pound160m from the Treasury.

Karin Hayhow, Marketing Director at Mackie’s, said: “This might well sound like an excuse for lots of fun – but we really do need a wide range of people to give us feedback on the taste of our products – that’s the most important attribute – and one that will inform what we go out to market with. “We always try to do something special for the RHS as it’s an integral part of the Mackie’s business, so we’re thrilled to be invited to participate on board the SRUC’s amazing new facility.“Hopefully the participants will enjoy getting a peek into the behind-the-scenes process of testing products before they are released on to the market.”Students at the college will be assisting with the sensory lab throughout the show, featuring a range of produce.

One befriendee said these befrienders are \u0026ldquolike young relations.The benefits of this are twofold. As well as keeping the befriendees company, it gets the young befriendees into the voluntary mind-set early on, encourages them to become more empathetic and confident and it shows they can make a difference.Befriendees also benefit from regular contact with people \u0026ldquoso they feel as though they\u0026rsquore part of the community, according to befriending co-ordinator Elspeth Manson.Angie added: \u0026ldquoHelping someone recognise their worth is a benefit for both the befriendee and the volunteer.The recruitment procedure includes volunteers receiving Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) clearance and providing three references. Once accepted, training includes support from other groups such as stroke awareness, Hearing and Sight Care and Parkinson\u0026rsquos awareness.Befriending Caithness is not a standalone organisation \u0026ndash it is helped by the community.An event to look out for is a fashion show at M\u0026ampCo in Thurso on June 28, starting at 7pm. Tickets cost \u0026pound5 and this will go towards the July summer lunch.As well as being greatly appreciated by co-ordinators, the joy felt by the befriendees is evident.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh.

I\u0026rsquom sure there are a lot of people who won\u0026rsquot know them.He explained that only the base of the memorial, which was erected in 1903, was still to be refurbished with the interpretation panels set to complete the whole project.The path along by the memorial is on the Wick section of the John O\u0026rsquoGroats Trail, a 147-mile route from Inverness.Mr Bogle pointed out that interpretation panels were already in place on the stretch of the trail through Wick, with one at the Trinkie. However, two existing panels are being moved to the Braehead and North Head.He said the paths were already proving popular with local people and visitors and the group is keen to provide information about the area.Mr Bogle added that the civil engineer\u0026rsquos gravestone \u0026ndash in the graveyard of Wick St Fergus Church \u0026ndash had also been tidied up recently.Wick Harbour Authority chairman Willie Watt MBE said: \u0026ldquoFor me James Bremner is one of the unsung heroes of Caithness. He is just an amazing character. Nothing was too difficult for him and he treated everybody he worked with the greatest of respect. He was a great leader and motivator.Mr Watt pointed out that one of the Wick engineer\u0026rsquos greatest achievements was the refloating of the SS Great Britain \u0026ndash the largest ship of its time \u0026ndash when she ran aground off Ireland in the 1840s.He said that Mr Bremner was sent for from Wick, along with a few of his men, when other engineers had failed in one of the biggest salvage operations of that era.James Bremner (1784-1856) was born at Stain, Keiss. He was an apprentice in a Greenock shipyard and returned to Wick to establish his own shipbuilding business, constructing over 50 vessels in as many years as well as designing and building many harbours. He was involved in the construction of the breakwater at Wick harbour.A local author, John Mowat, once described Mr Bremner as \u0026ldquothe Ulysses of the north and \u0026ldquoour greatest Caithnessian.Mr Bremner is still remembered in Keiss with a plaque at the harbour erected by the Institution of Civil Engineers.Thursday 21 Jun 2018 8:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June 21, 2018 at 1:38 pmOrkney has the highest food safety standards in Scotland, according to a recent survey by consumer group Which?.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers. It’s a very busy few days for our producers, but always worth the effort and it also gives us an opportunity to tell the wider story about Orkney and all its other attractions.”Amongst the Orkney businesses travelling to the show will be newcomers, J. Gow Rum, makers of the county’s first locally produced rum.Collin van Schayk of rum producers, VS Distillers, said: “We’re very much looking forward to introducing J. Gow Rum to the visitors at this year’s Royal Highland Show. The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events. We all share the same vision in terms of upholding Orkney’s reputation as a quality food and drink location and we’re all very proud to be representing the islands on the national stage.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Feedback gathered will help us as we review route and timetable specifications for the 2020-2025 contract.”Both the ‘Bus Users’ and ‘Non-Bus Users’ surveys are available from the ‘Consultation and Engagement’ section of the council website. The direct link is available here.Paper copies are available on request from the Council’s Transportation Team for those unable to access the online surveys, by emailing transport@orkney.gov.uk or calling tel 01856 873535 ext 2539.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
