His team piled in with blankets to put him out – but he still lost an eyebrow and some of his moustache’Storm Thorgerson and I had created most of the artwork for Pink Floyd’s albums, including Dark Side of the Moon. One day we were asked to Abbey Road Studios to listen to tracks from the band’s new record. The lyrics were mostly about absence, and the album’s title, Wish You Were Here, was a reference to Syd Barrett, who had left the band some years earlier due to issues with LSD. They were also making a statement about record company executives who regarded musicians as money-making machines, demanding one hit song after another – an\u0026nbspabsence of\u0026nbspa different kind.I went to Los Angeles to find a Hollywood stuntman. The photograph was taken on the Warner Bros back lot in Burbank with Ronnie Rondell, the guy on fire, shaking hands with another stuntman, Danny Rogers. I explained to Ronnie what I needed and he said: “It’s dangerous for a man to stand still on fire. Normally, you’re running and the fire’s spreading behind you, or you’re falling and the fire is above you, or you can always make out with camera angles that the stunt person is closer to the fire than they really are, but to stand still …?” He was very reluctant, but eventually agreed.\u0026nbspI had a suit and wig made that were soaked in flame retardant, Ronnie was covered in this gel – it was like napalm – and his team set him on fire. We repeated the process 14 times, took the shot, and then on the 15th a gust of wind blew up and wrapped the fire around his face and burnt him. He threw himself to the ground and his whole team piled on blankets to put him out. He said: “That’s it! I’m done!” However, I had captured the shot successfully on that last take. Ronnie was very gracious about it considering he had lost an eyebrow and some of his moustache, but as far as he was concerned as a professional in the movie industry it was all in a day’s work.I knew I had got a special picture. It took a long time to persuade Ronnie to stand exactly as I wanted but in the end he was very brave and it was a perfect composition. Years afterwards Ronnie said his only regret was most people know him more for the Pink Floyd album cover than the famous fire stunts he had performed in movies such as The Towering Inferno.Back in London, Storm suggested to the band that we should not give away the front cover picture quite so easily and if the album is really about absence we should make the cover photograph absent too. So we shrink-wrapped the whole package in black plastic. When it was released people had no idea what the album cover looked like. Some would tear off the plastic wrapping and throw it away, while others would carefully cut it open with a surgical knife, extract the vinyl and keep the package intact. It felt like Christmas – you are given something, you rip off the paper, which is physical and tactile, and when you open it up there’s a present inside.Album covers were important in those days. They were signposts to what the band was all about, because you didn’t have MTV, or Spotify or YouTube, and only four or five music papers and maybe a couple of weekly TV pop shows were available to fans.With Pink Floyd, I always seem to get into some scrape or other. At Roger Waters’ request I flew a giant inflatable pig over Battersea power station for Pink Floyd’s Animals cover, but it escaped into the flightpath of planes flying into Heathrow airport. It could have caused an aviation disaster – thank God it didn’t. We managed to retrieve the pig and rephotograph the shot again the next day, and the photograph looked fabulous in the end.The image of the band was not a priority for Hipgnosis. What we did care about was creating an eye-catching idea that would be visually and intellectually stimulating but was not necessarily related to the lyrics or the title of the album.\u0026nbspWe enjoyed creating designs that were visual puns or stories with photographs so when people looked carefully they could decide what the picture was about for themselves. Hipgnosis never gave explanations for our work, and like a mystery novel, a man on fire shaking hands was a conundrum to be solved.\u0026nbspTraining: The London School of Film Technique.High point: “A picture we did very early on for a band called the Nice. It was a picture of 40 red footballs in the Sahara desert.”Low point: “Doing a photograph that you really think’s going to turn into something great, and it’s a piece of shit. And sometimes there’s no explanation for that.” Top tip: “You have to network, have acumen, and be street-smart about how you’re going to develop this career and be something.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90350503a56805846013d5a265f1c49498fc5323/0_0_5290_3174/master/5290.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=cfb6098bb8d97994f989aaa3d8555c3f","title":"life returns to wuhan in pictures","story":"Wuhan’s 76-day quarantine was lifted in April, bringing life and traffic back to its streets"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93396bf68ea67ae6f669a19a90e38722bda0f886/0_217_6500_3901/master/6500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7729775e08295cf3c4a56dd52aedd477","title":"uk staff how is your employer introducing a sense of community to a virtual office coronavirus","story":"We would like to hear about how you are staying in touch with colleagues while working remotely due to coronavirusHow are employers helping homeworking colleagues keep in touch with each other?

There were also concerns about conditions in distribution centres and factories at the height of the pandemic.But after high street stores closed at the end of March, shoppers switched to buying from their screens to stock up on comfy lockdown clothing, beauty treatments and summer kit.Asos said the consumer and economic outlook remained uncertain and the strength of its sales and profits performance would depend on how customer shopping behaviour changed in the longer term.“The second half has been a period of tremendous change for Asos, we have made real progress and shown resilience through the period and are exiting the year in a strong position,” the company said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08e3c38565b5083d1f1ced7fe4b691f068fd9c3e/0_0_4395_2639/master/4395.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f4fc4c808ca4475f230bd7a89315f383","title":"how does uks covid recession compare with previous ones","story":"Latest slump deeper than 2008-09 financial crisis, deindustrialisation of 80s or oil shocks of 70sThe coronavirus pandemic has plunged Britain’s economy into the deepest slump since quarterly records began, with the country officially confirmed in recession for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis.The biggest downturn of the past two centuries came just after the first world war and the Spanish flu – the last major pandemic to strike – which killed more people than the conflict. Britain suffered a difficult transition from the war as coal strikes and the standing down of wartime production sank the country into a depression, with GDP collapsing by roughly a quarter between 1919 and 1921. Growth returned in 1922 but aftershocks continued, leading to the 1926 general strike, which caused another recession that year.The US was hit much harder than Britain after the Wall Street crash of 1929, in part because the UK had already suffered in the 1920s. The Great Depression delivered a monumental hit to living standards amid mass unemployment and prompted a sea-change in economic thinking, with President Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal spending package rebooting the US economy. Britain became the first country to come off the Gold Standard, allowing the pound and interest rates to fall, helping to boost industry and housebuilding.The classic example of boom and bust economic cycles came in the early 1990s as Britain lurched into recession after a period of stellar economic growth during the late 1980s. Under the chancellor, Nigel Lawson, deregulation of the City of London helped fuel easier borrowing conditions, while tax cuts and low interest rates prompted a property boom. After interest rates were doubled in 1989 to curb inflation, unemployment soared and house repossessions hit record levels. The bust was made worse by the EU’s Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), which prevented interest rate cuts.The collapse that followed the 2008 banking crisis was the worst since the second world war. Banks around the world stopped lending to one another amid market panic over losses on speculative investments and the crisis led to huge government bailouts to prevent banks collapsing. Starved of access to finance, businesses failed and job losses soared. The recession that began between the run on Northern Rock in the UK in September 2007 and the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the US a year later has had a lingering aftermath , with a decade of anaemic recovery made worse by austerity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7559d20e3f6071fb5834d679a28120cda5e306a2/0_433_3278_1967/master/3278.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a2eac2b098bc85a35b8f6206a91e5406","title":"windermere business booms as britons holiday in lake district","story":"Tourists flock back to South Lakeland, once ‘furlough capital of the UK’ If there was a corner of the UK that felt the sharp impact of recession first, it was the tourist honeypot of lake Windermere. Visitors disappeared overnight, just as shops and bars were readying for the booming spring and summer months.But on a sweltering Wednesday afternoon, as the UK officially entered the deepest recession since records began, the streets of Bowness-on-Windermere were once again thronging with visitors.“This is like August 2019 busy,” said Jennifer Cormack, 38, the sales director at Windermere Lake Cruises, surveying the crowds of day trippers along the jetty. But its tours could now carry only 500 passengers a day along England’s biggest natural lake, compared with 5,000 before coronavirus, she said. Trade was increasingly busy, but it was “infuriating” they could not sell more seats because of Covid-safe measures. The company put more than 100 members of staff on furlough when lockdown struck, but has taken every one back.Bookings for campsites and self-catering accommodation appear to have surged in this part of the Lake District, where one in five of all properties is on Airbnb. Hotels seem to be taking as many guests as they can. Holidaymakers who would have gone to the continent, or on cruises, are instead flocking to the countryside. Some are spending £400 to hire a small boat for two hours, Cormack said.But foreign visitors, who traditionally have the deepest pockets, are being missed. Visitors from China, Japan, Germany and the US account for a big chunk of the £1.5bn spent in South Lakeland every year, half of all Cumbria’s tourist revenue.“The foreign tourists are good spenders. British tourists have returned nicely but we’re missing the foreign tourists,” said Andrew Clayton, 60, who opened Cooks Corner hardware store 37 years ago. All of his nine staff were furloughed but are back at work. He said it was difficult to say how the business would cope with the revenue missed earlier this year: “We’ve got three months to do well. I’m optimistic.”Some lakeside shops were advertising vacancies on Wednesday. The often-younger seasonal workers who come here each summer, many from mainland Europe, are staying away, perhaps because of safety concerns about travel or accommodation. “There’s not that many people wanting to work,” said Joanna Biernat, 40, the manager of Driftwood restaurant. Biernat was hopeful that the business would survive – “everyone loves our fish and chips” – but said it was not possible to recoup the earnings lost. “We had to spend a lot of money for people to stay safe,” she said, pointing to the screens separating outdoor tables.At Huttons Chocolates, business was “booming”, its joint owner, Kay Forsgardh, 59, said. “Every day now is like a really good Saturday. It’s unprecedented busy.” The family-run chocolatier, which supplies many local hotels, was devastated to have to close on the eve of Easter, traditionally its busiest period.The hundreds of unsold chocolate eggs were melted down to make truffles and the 18-year-old firm is doing well, doubling its staff from two to four. “It’s absolutely tremendous. We’re hiring more staff because I think this will be the trend – people are nervous to get on planes,” Forsgardh said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db9417153affec96ded6be0f1608d19d7cb742d2/0_69_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c8d5855a9839873f2249c0b6b1da6e1","title":"government britains rivers uk waterways farming water companies","story":"Across the UK, once thriving waterways are being wiped out by farming and water companiesYou can judge the state of a nation by the state of its rivers. Pollution is the physical expression of corruption. So what should we conclude about a country whose rivers are systematically exploited, dumped on and bled dry?I’m writing from the Welsh borders, where I’m supposed to be on holiday. It’s among the most beautiful regions of Britain, but the rivers here are dying before my eyes. When I last saw it, four years ago, the Monnow, a lovely tributary of the River Wye, had a mostly clean, stony bed. Now the bottom is smothered in slime and filamentous algae. In the back eddies, the rotting weed floats to the surface, carrying the stench of cow slurry.A few days ago, part of another tributary of the Wye, the Llynfi, was wiped out by a pollution surge, for the third time in five years. Hundreds of trout, grayling and bullheads floated to the surface, while rare white-clawed crayfish crawled out of the water. In the Ewyas valley, I discovered, out of sight of any vantage point, that part of the Honddu, another beautiful little river, is being illegally quarried for loose stone. Ancient alders and ashes on its banks have been ripped out to make way for the digger.The Wye itself is dying at astonishing, heartbreaking speed. When I canoed it 10 years ago, the stones were clean. Now they are so slimy that you can scarcely stand up. In hot weather, the entire river stinks of chicken shit, from the 10 million birds being reared in the catchment. We made the mistake of swimming in it: I almost gagged when I smelled the water. The free-range farms are the worst: the birds carpet the fields with their highly reactive dung, which is then washed into the catchment by rain. Several times a year, algal blooms now turn the clear river cloudy. The fish gasp for breath. Aquatic insects suffocate.Critics argue that the water companies blatantly abuse the “exceptional circumstances” rule, which allows them to discharge raw sewage into our rivers during extreme storms and floods. Official records show that the companies dump untreated sewage into many of our rivers and chalk streams for thousands of hours a year. What we are seeing across Britain is complete regulatory collapse. Even after the extreme and sudden pollution of the Llynfi, the “emergency” team at Natural Resources Wales failed to arrive for 13 hours, and refused to accept a water sample taken by a local person at the peak of the incident. In the Wye catchment, Powys county council is licensing new chicken farms behind closed doors. In England, the Environment Agency turns a blind eye: of 76,000 pollution and fly-tipping cases reported last year, just one resulted in a fixed penalty notice. Yes, one. As the ENDS Report documents, the agency’s own officers see its monitoring methods as completely useless.The economic power of the water companies and the cultural power of the farmers both translate into political power. Special interests rule. The public and the living world come last. Peer into your local river, and you’ll see the political filth flow past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fe8f63c91e48c936281ed707b8269e1bbc0d85f/0_185_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=958e8f528fc89e671761bee51f14df4b","title":"ppe britain rentier capitalism assets uk economy","story":"The distribution of assets, and the government’s role in it, drives the UK economy. The latest example shouldn’t surprise usIn his memoir Boone, the legendary US oilman T Boone Pickens recalled casting envious glances towards the North Sea from his station in the Gulf of Mexico. It was the 1970s, there was oil to be had, and the British government was issuing exploration licences. “I couldn’t help thinking about the great possibilities across the Atlantic,” Pickens wrote, “especially when I learned that 50,000-acre tracts were being given free to companies willing to explore them. To oilmen used to paying millions just for the privilege of drilling, that was a real incentive.”I was reminded of Pickens’ awe last week when it was revealed that Boris Johnson’s administration had handed an exclusive £252m contract for the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) to a supplier with no experience of providing such equipment, and owned by an adviser to the international trade secretary, Liz Truss. Condemnation was swift and widespread – it was “brazen cronyism” this was not the way things should work. It didn’t help that the 50m face masks that were procured were ultimately unusable.But the most important feature of the PPE case is not its outlandishness. It is its utter normality. This is the rule of contemporary British capitalism, rather than the exception. To be sure, the links to Truss and the element of slapstick incompetence make it a particularly egregious example. That egregiousness should not blind us, however. The basic business model here is the business model that has defined the British economy from the 1970s to the present, from the North Sea to PPE.What is that model? Scholars have made various attempts to capture its essence. The two that have gained most traction are “financialisation” and “neoliberalism”. Neither concept quite suffices, even as both get at important developments. Rather, the UK economy is a quintessential case of rentier capitalism. It is an exemplar of what the Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman called a “rentier regime”.To understand rentier capitalism, one first needs to understand rent. Rent is income generated by virtue of exclusive ownership or control of a scarce asset of some kind. A rentier is the recipient of this income: the inidual or, more commonly, corporation that controls the asset. Rentier capitalism is an economic order organised around income-generating assets, in which overall incomes are dominated by rents and economic life is dominated by rentiers. Fundamentally orientated to “having” rather than “doing”, it is based on a proprietorial rather than entrepreneurial ethos. That, in short, is the UK since the 1970s.In the PPE case, the asset is the exclusive £252m contract. In the North Sea case, it was the exclusive exploration licence and resulting oil. Alongside contracts and natural resources, five other key categories of asset make up the contemporary rentier economy. Land and buildings, including housing, represent the most obvious. Intellectual property (IP) – patents, brands and copyright – is another, so crucial in the pharmaceutical, consumer products and creative industries sectors.Another is infrastructure of various kinds, and in particular privatised networks for the delivery of water, energy and telecommunication services. Platforms, and especially digital platforms, that profit from control of the spaces of capitalist trade, are the penultimate kind. Last but not least, there are financial assets. If “financialisation” denotes the growing importance of these and of their owners, it is perhaps best thought of as a leading edge of rentier capitalism, not the totality of our economic moment.The PPE example is instructive for highlighting a definitive characteristic of rentier capitalism: the integral role of government. In this particular case, the government’s role was in creating and allocating the asset. The same was true in the North Sea in the 1970s and the privatisation bonanza of the 1980s and 1990s was nothing if not the creation of income-generating assets, ranging from ex-council houses to electricity transmission and distribution networks.Governments enable and support rents and rentiers in many other ways, too. They help shield assets from competition – through the granting and enforcement of strong IP rights, for example. They also shield rents from tax, most notably via generous treatments of capital gains and of income from property.The main problems with rentier capitalism are twofold. First, rentiers are inclined to sit on and sweat their income-generating assets, rather than innovate it is a recipe for economic stagnation. And second, because incomes accrue disproportionately to the asset-owning elite, it is an engine for growing inequalities of both income and wealth. You only have to look at the London housing market to see that process in action.Rentier capitalism is not unique to contemporary Britain. It exists, and has existed, much more widely, geographically and historically. But, courtesy of policies that have been almost unimaginably rentier-friendly since the 1970s, the UK is rentier capitalism’s apotheosis, where its prototypical ills – vast inequalities combined with entrenched stagnation – are on full display.“Let’s talk about the real money,” George Monbiot wrote in 2014. “The Westminster government claims to champion an entrepreneurial society, of wealth creators and hard-working families, but the real rewards and incentives are for rent.” Jonathan Ford, more succinctly, says Britain is “a rentier’s paradise”.The outraged commentary on the PPE debacle shows that we tend to think of rent-seeking as a departure from the economic norm, rather than the norm itself. Until that changes, it will be hard to address the policies that buttress rent and the rentier – and the inequalities and injustices that scar rentier capitalism will be here to stay.• Brett Christophers is professor at Sweden’s Uppsala University and author of the forthcoming Rentier Capitalism: Who Owns the Economy, and Who Pays for It?

The district, with an area of about 4,000 square miles (10,300 sq km) and rapidly depleting forest cover, is home to 70-80 elephants, but there have been no casualties related to human-elephant conflict since WRCS began working with more than 700 farmers in the surrounding villages.There is, however, no easy fix to the problem. “Every human-elephant conflict situation is different,” says Mehta. “There is no ‘one size fits all’ solution. We study the circumstances first and find a site-specific solution.“Elephants, being highly intelligent animals, get habituated to the deterrents over time, requiring us to rotate measures or invent new ones. Our aim is to provide farmers with an array of simple, inexpensive deterrents to protect their crops. Solutions also need to be community-wide to be effective. It is pointless if the elephant is dissuaded from entering one farm and then goes and raids the next farm. So we encourage the entire village to participate in crop guarding.”Multiple factors determine the effectiveness of a particular method, including the time of year and location of the farm. Chilli smoke and other fire-based deterrents, which work well during the dry months, are not viable during the monsoon.Mehta adds: “Elephants prefer to raid farms which are unguarded. So human presence is the main deterrent. In most cases, night guarding from a tree watchtower, coupled with a low-cost, early-warning system – a trip alarm consisting of a modified doorbell tied across possible entry points with nylon ropes – works well to keep the elephants at bay.”For farmers living close to an evergreen forest, there is another lucrative deterrent – a beehive fence.Beehive fences were first successfully trialled and implemented in Kenya by Lucy King of the Elephants and Bees Project, where it was found that the fences could exploit the African elephant’s natural fear of bees. Inspired by a meeting with King at a conference, Mehta decided to try out the fences in Uttara Kannada. Farmers in the district have traditionally practised apiculture, so they were already comfortable handling hives. But there were concerns about the effectiveness of bee fences in India as Asian bee species are less aggressive than African bees.They need not have worried. WRCS’s programme officer in Uttara Kannada, Ravi Yellapur, says 367 farmers in the district now have beehive fences. “Since I joined the project in 2015, there hasn’t been a single instance of an elephant breaching a bee fence to gain entry,” he adds.The locally made fences consist of eight to 10 hollow logs, about a foot in length and with a wide cavity, which are hung between two wooden poles at intervals of 10 metres. The logs are connected to each other by strong wires. The inside of each log is coated with a liquid mixture of beeswax, cinnamon and jaggery (a local, unrefined sugar). Both ends of the log are plugged, except for one or two small holes that allow the Apis cerena bees in Uttara Kannada to enter. The bees are drawn to the logs by the smell of the mixture. Being natural pollinators, the bees help increase the farmer’s crop yield while the honey harvested twice a year provides additional income. About 4kg of “elephant-friendly” honey is taken from one hive per harvest, and the farmer can sell it for 300 rupees (£3) a kilo. This financial incentive, coupled with the regular awareness sessions conducted by WRCS and the local forest department, has helped build a tolerance to elephants among the community.In other parts of India, a more hi-tech solution has been implemented. Elephants, once locally extinct in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, began to make an appearance about 30 years ago, after being displaced from their home ranges in neighbouring states. More recently, a 19-member herd began raiding crops in the Mahasamund district of the state. So, in 2017, the Chhattisgarh Forest Department invited conservation non-profit Wildlife SOS to develop a conflict mitigation plan. The organisation proposed an early warning system based on putting a radio collar on the matriarch of the herd, which was implemented in 2018. Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder of Wildlife SOS, says: “Signals from the collar alert the Wildlife SOS team, who inform the forest department about the movement of the matriarch, and therefore the herd. If there is potential for conflict, the forest officials inform the village heads via WhatsApp. Radio announcements are also made. This early warning is critical for the villagers to be prepared when the herd approaches.” The villagers then use the acrid smoke from chillis and other tactics to ert the herd.Key to the success of all these methods is changing the attitude of local communities towards elephants. Yellapur says: “Farmers who were once angry about the presence of elephants now think of them as their friends.”Given the ever-increasing anthropogenic pressures on forests and other wildlife habitats, Mahesh Rangarajan, chairman of the Elephant Task Force, which reported in 2010 on recommendations to safeguard the future of elephants in India, says: “We focus on human-elephant conflict but in reality, elephants are symbolic of all wildlife. We must learn to cohabit with every kind of wildlife.“To reduce conflict in the long-term, we need holistic solutions that include protecting wildlife habitats and landscapes, while ensuring human livelihoods and dignity are protected as well.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ab3f8b9b4fe2e695caad4f566cb3a9cacc78da4/0_454_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d95d1412af2d9026c8a64ec9a6fb765c","title":"hsbc sounds alarm over investment in meat giant jbs due to deforestation inaction","story":"Bank argues JBS has ‘no action plan’ to tackle link between indirect suppliers and Amazon destruction following  investigationAnalysts at global banking giant HSBC have sounded the alarm over the potential risks of investing in JBS, the world’s biggest meat company, after a string of investigations raising concerns about Amazon deforestation issues in its beef supply chain.The meat giant “has no vision, action plan, timeline, technology or solution” for monitoring whether the cattle it buys originate from farms involved in rainforest destruction, according to analysis by the bank, which has substantial investments in the troubled meat packing firm.In a recent financial report on JBS – obtained by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism – HSBC analysts said they had asked the company “multiple times” about its plan to address deforestation but appeared to be unsatisfied, leading them to conclude that “the pressure is on JBS”.The analysts expressed disquiet that in their view the company had allowed a smaller competitor to take on the mantle of addressing forest destruction, after Marfrig – another Brazilian beef exporter – committed to full traceability of its Amazon cattle by 2025.It adds: “There is a valuation benefit that goes with being the largest solution provider to deforestation in Brazil and unfortunately, we don’t see JBS inclined to lead and own that title.”JBS, which has annual revenues of $50bn (£38bn) and slaughters almost 35,000 cattle a day in Brazil, is coming under increasing pressure from investors over its environmental record. The investment arm of northern Europe’s largest financial services group last month dropped the company from its portfolio. JBS is now excluded from assets sold by Nordea Asset Management, which controls a €230bn (£210bn) fund.The HSBC report cites a recent investigation by the Bureau, the  and Repórter Brasil revealing that JBS’s trucks had moved cattle from a ranch marked by government data as being under sanction due to illegal deforestation to a “clean” farm, which in turn sold cattle onto JBS abattoirs.JBS disputed the findings, but did not give a clear explanation of exactly where their trucks had been collecting cattle from. The investigation prompted calls for supermarkets and fast food chains to immediately cease trading with JBS.HSBC analysts discussed JBS’s recent attempt to split the Brazilian part of its business from its global operations, in order to float the international arm on the New York Stock Exchange with no Amazon risk for investors.The report also refers to other historical issues. “After its legacy of governance and corruption problems, JBS’s board and senior leadership are in need of proof points that the firm has indeed turned over a new leaf on ESG responsibility matters.”HSBC holds JBS shares and bonds worth some $9 million, according to recent research by the NGO Feedback.HSBC told the Bureau that those holdings were usually held on behalf of other parties and that in such cases the bank had no part in the decision to invest in specific companies.The bank’s report comes amid global outrage over the fate of the world’s biggest rainforest. The Amazon is a crucial buffer in stabilising the regional and global climate. Experts say its preservation is essential to tackling the climate emergency.Last year, a study by supply-chain initiative Trase concluded that JBS’s global beef exports were linked to up to 300 sq km of deforestation per year in Brazil.JBS told the Bureau and the : “As we are due to report results to our investors and stakeholders later this week, we believe it is good practice to avoid further comments at this time.

These venomous creatures hide just beneath the sand, eyes peeking above to survey the surrounding landscape for potential prey. Bathers often succumb if stung, your best bet is to plunge your feet into very hot water and keep them there for as long as possible.This local has a simpler solution: waterproof sandals. Hers, a taupe pair by Merrell, are lightweight, waterproof, a special sort of elective ugliness. They are also just one of a litany of water shoes designed for use both in water and on dry land. Newly coined as amphibious shoes, they are not in themselves new, but along with the floafers (a loafer that floats), GQ-approved Hoka One One Hopara sandals, a new collaboration of wipe-clean sandals designed by super-stylist Lotta Volkova for Adidas, and later this month a neoprene pair in orange and red from a collaboration between Palace skateboards and Adidas, they have emerged as the sandal of now.Crocs, the most infamous of these shoes, turn 18 this year, and the pandemic has been good for their health. “We have seen a surge in demand for our icon, the Classic clog,” says the company’s vice-president of lockdown sales. People who wouldn’t have been seen dead in Crocs, the hybrid monstrosities designed by three boating enthusiasts, have given in to their perfect practicality. Black and tie-dye versions have even sold out.Vogue describe these wearers as Croc-verts, and where Crocs have led, others have followed. For their AW20 show, Balenciaga flooded Paris’ Cité du Cinema film studio – and front row seats – with water to highlight climate change, and put models in galoshes and waterproof shoes. Tevas, launched in the 1980s as little more than a velcro watch strap attached to a flip-flop, were designed to be worn on rafting trips in the great American outdoors. They have since appeared on catwalks at Prada, Stella McCartney and Anna Sui (the latter wears them on the beach herself). Actors-turned-designers the Olsen Twins, known for their four-figure fashion line The Row, have been seen in a version that cost £35.The ccookery writer Claire Roberson pivoted to Tevas about three years ago. Now living in Sicily, she says she wears hers eight months of the year. Her logic is comprehensive – she wears them for hiking, gardening, land work and swimming. “They are also perfect for swollen ankles in the heat,” she says.There is an impulse right now to attribute every hat, shirt and shoe to some form of pandemic-fuelled uncertainty. But trends don’t occur in isolation. And the rise of amphibious shoes, which place practicality squarely above looks, suggests a desire for a return to a more natural state. They also allow for the sort of flexible lifestyle that the current situation – and weather – demands of us.Paul Watson, the head of press for menswear at Matchesfashion, says more and more people have been buying these sorts of “technical sandals”. He mentions Suicoke (pricey) and Hoka One One (less pricey) during lockdown, but also Birkenstocks beach shoes, waterproof versions modelled on the cork original, and produced in garish shades of green and purple. Watson, who owns eight pairs, happily wears “the ones designed for the beach” when it’s raining. “It’s definitely an indication that comfort is the current order of the day,” he says.Affordable, comfortable and versatile, the amphibious shoe-wearer is paying to feel something like being barefoot. If clothes help us define how a crisis has changed our lives – see Zoom shirts, slipped on for meetings like flak jackets, and tracksuits replacing white collars as acceptable office wear – then these shoes are very much a sign of the times, representative of the way in which comfort and practicality have overwhelmed convention and fashion. But, as is the case with anything that purports to make our lives better, we democratise it, commodify it and thus it goes mainstream. Perhaps, like weever fish, they have been lying in wait all this time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a3a993cf0bfd6ee07601f184b83fc3183d215c3/0_17_2939_1764/master/2939.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c24e18f9144dc6d5ad68bdbbce464535","title":"elvis thats the way it is review","story":"The off-hand moments from this 1970 documentary following Elvis Presley as he sets up shop in Las Vegas are the most illuminatingThis 1970 documentary, directed by Denis Sanders, captures singer Elvis Presley in his late-baroque, macramé hip-belt stage as he first rehearses and then performs live in Las Vegas, a limited residency in the desert town that became the stuff of legend. The material, released before in slightly different versions, has been dusted off and digitally gussied up for a one-night-only engagement in cinemas nationwide.This is the 2001 cut, which has more performance footage and less cutaways to fans rhapsodising about the King and shots of him just hanging out with his entourage post-gig. No doubt that will make it a more attractive package for feisty public viewings, a more “event cinema” edition. But that means sacrificing some of endearing original documentary elements that make this such a time capsule, especially the full range of super-groovy, late 1960searly 70s textiles in all their op-art, polyester glory. Some digital designer should work out a way to forensically recreate some of the shirt prints on display here, especially Elvis’s psychedelic purple, orange and chocolate-brown crushed velvet number that he wears for a rehearsal of That’s All Right Mama, accessorised with a white towel draped round his neck to soak up the sweat.It’s a debate as old as time as to what’s the best Elvis period – young, hip swivelling idol, or chunky, past-his-prime showman – and this film captures him definitely towards the latter end of the spectrum, when he was still full of confidence but hungry to please. Musically, the most enchanting scenes are those that capture him joshing and jamming with the band, whether it’s with a mash-up of Little Sister morphing into a cover of Let it Be, or working with the backing singers on the choir-style crescendo for Bridge Over Troubled Waters. It’s these off-hand spontaneous moments that really capture just how drenched he was in talent and dedicated to his craft."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/faad0a819a657876cc7112596a9c70992000e819/323_539_2779_2778/master/2779.jpg?width=445\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=max\u0026s=302b5116d13d2746f1e54d8362449ea8","title":"a tough tough task tindall steps into howes shoes at bournemouth","story":"New manager on Wenger’s influence, how his son convinced him to take the job and replacing his long-time friendWhen Eddie Howe called Jason Tindall to tell him he would be taking a break from management, the latter’s holiday in Croatia was about to get a lot more hectic. “Every couple of hours I had my son in my ear, saying: ‘Dad, are you going to be a manager, are you going to be manager?’” says Tindall, smiling. “The more I said to him: ‘I’m not sure,’ he said: ‘Well, what else are you going to do?’ When I asked myself that question, it made my decision that little bit easier.”Tindall, whose 10-year-old son, Levi, is in the club’s academy, returned to Bournemouth last Friday and, having sought assurances from the club’s Russian owner, Maxim Demin, that there would not be a mass exodus of prized assets, he signed a three-year contract to succeed Howe, with whom he played before sharing an office for 12 years after 569 matches as his assistant manager.Together they went on a remarkable journey, from putting their hands in their own pockets to cover the cost of a fitness coach and masseur in League Two to the heady days of the Premier League, where they spent five seasons before relegation last month, prompting Howe’s departure that signalled the end of an era.Nathan Aké has since joined Manchester City for £41m, while Sheffield United are expected to increase their offer for their former goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale after having a £12m bid rejected. Callum Wilson and Joshua King, who is out of contract next summer, are also likely to depart but Bournemouth are determined to compete for promotion next season.“If the club turned around and said: ‘There’s going to be a fire sale, you’re going to end up losing eight or nine players,’ then I wouldn’t be sitting in this seat now,” Tindall says.He insists he will not be Howe’s “clone” but recognises he could scarcely have had a better apprenticeship and acknowledges that following in the footsteps of the club’s greatest ever manager has the makings of a trying task, with Howe’s departure leaving behind a similarly shaped hole to when Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger departed Manchester United and Arsenal respectively or, more recently, when Paul Tisdale relinquished his title as the country’s longest-serving manager after 12 years at Exeter City.“I think for anyone replacing Ed, trying to fill his shoes is a tough, tough task, as was Ferguson and other guys,” says Tindall. “But is there anyone that knows the football club better than me? Is there any guarantee with anyone else stepping in that the club would achieve success? From my point of view, I have learned and lived by Ed who is one of the best managers and coaches out there. The pressure is there, always, but I feel I am ready to take the club forward and hopefully get back to the Premier League.”Tindall played for Senrab, the east London team formed by his father, Jimmy, where John Terry and Jermain Defoe started their careers, and spent five years on the books of Arsenal. In the early days of his coaching career, he and Howe visited Wenger at training on numerous occasions.“When you first step into coaching you’re so wet behind the ears so to speak, with so much to learn,” he says. “We were fortunate enough to go and watch Arsène and Arsenal work. We were big fans of the way they played and his philosophy and that was a really big driving force in terms of what we wanted to try and bring to Bournemouth.”Tindall, who has a Uefa pro licence – the highest coaching qualification in the game – believes he can lead Bournemouth back to the Premier League at the first attempt. As an internal appointment, continuity also presents challenges. Gareth Ainsworth, the Wycombe manager, highlighted the importance of shifting from “Gaz” to “gaffer” in his players’ eyes after initially struggling to assert his authority among former teammates, while last week Harry Redknapp explained how calling the shots as a manager compared to being a coach “is a different ball game” – in effect how leaving out players from starting lineups can cause your popularity to plummet.There are already decisions to make before Bournemouth return to pre-season training on Monday. Before then, determining the futures of Simon Francis – the club captain – Andrew Surman and Charlie Daniels is high on the to-do list."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e3de5c4a287c93daa4d0df22d6e7f357a400042/293_0_1375_825/master/1375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45ffdaa0c0391aa151cee98d60db8ea1","title":"xbox series x to launch in november but halo infinite delayed until 2021","story":"New console will arrive without its showpiece title as troubled Halo sequel is put on holdThe Xbox Series X console will launch in November, but without its most anticipated title, Halo: Infinite. Microsoft announced on Tuesday that the game will be delayed until 2021.Writing on the official Halo blog, Chris Lee, studio head of Halo Infinite at developer 343 Industries, claimed the team would need more time to finish the game, partly due to production difficulties caused by the coronavirus pandemic. He said: “It is not sustainable for the wellbeing of our team or the overall success of the game to ship it this holiday.”The studio has also acknowledged negative reactions to a demo of the game shown at a Microsoft Xbox event in July. The game’s visuals were widely criticised, with landscapes and character models said to lack the fidelity expected of a next-generation title. Developers said the preview was a “work in progress”, adding in a blogpost: “With Halo Infinite, we’re returning to a more ‘classic’ art style, which was a key message going back to the very first reveal that garnered enthusiastic and positive responses.”Announcing the November launch date for the Xbox Series X, Microsoft downplayed the Halo Infinite delay and said that 50 games enhanced for the new machine would arrive in 2020. Yet the loss of such an important sequel from the launch window will leave the machine with no first-party titles for its debut and only a handful of smaller third-party titles with Xbox Series X enhancements.The Xbox Series X, which Microsoft claims is four times more powerful than the Xbox One X, will be competing against the PlayStation 5, also set to arrive this winter. A sequel to successful action adventure Marvel’s Spider-Man is the latter’s key launch title.Microsoft’s Phil Spencer has hinted that Xbox Series X is likely to compete aggressively on price. The console’s impressive Game Pass monthly subscription also gives users access to hundreds of titles, including all Microsoft exclusives, and will soon support the company’s xCloud infrastructure, allowing subscribers to stream games directly to smartphones, tablets and other devices. However, this asset received a blow earlier this month when Apple revealed it would not allow the xCloud app and other cloud-based gaming services on iOS devices. In a later statement, Microsoft said it was still “committed to bringing xCloud to iPhone”.Microsoft has not announced which date the new console will launch or the release date of Halo: Infinite."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e586ecc17eef15ccf8e2532c489cf3ed859ae9d/0_120_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13adb233d893fd0a069bda263f7dc493","title":"entire families are arriving at our shores covid drives tunisian exodus","story":"Italy is facing an influx of people trafficked on fishing boats, desperate to escape Tunisia’s deepening economic crisisUnsurprisingly for a coastal town perched upon Tunisia’s border with Libya, it’s hot when Ahmed climbs into the back of the car outside the petrol station in Zarzis.It’s clear from the outset he feels uncomfortable talking to a journalist. Nevertheless, he’s here.Speaking through a translator, Ahmed explains how, with the loss of this year’s tourist season due to the pandemic, his seasonal job in the nearby island resorts of Djerba has failed to materialise. Now he’s saving what money he can from casual work at a local gym for the 4,000 Tunisian dinars, (£1,125) he’ll need to make the illegal crossing from Tunisia into Europe.“In Tunisia you can work, but you don’t make money. What you earn, you consume. Before coronavirus there were no jobs,” he says, referring to the country’s endemic unemployment. “Now with coronavirus it’s not going to get better.”Departing from points along Tunisia’s coast, Tunisians are now the largest group of nationals arriving in Italy, according to figures from the interior ministry, testing its reception centres to the limit. In the first six months of 2019, 1,277 arrivals from Tunisia were intercepted by Italian authorities. This year, that number rose to 6,628.In July alone, as the pandemic took hold and the waters calmed, 4,252 migrants were intercepted by Italian authorities, compared with 502 the previous year. These numbers do not include those who landed in Italy undetected.Compared with many countries so far Tunisia’s brush with Covid-19 has been light. At the time of writing, only 1,678 cases of the virus had been detected, resulting in 51 deaths, though the threat of a potential second spike looms ominously.However, for an economy still struggling to recover from the conditions that led to its 2011 revolution, the combined effect of the lockdown, the loss of its tourism season and the global economic downturn is proving devastating.By the government’s own estimate, joblessness in the tourism sector alone could reach 400,000.Moreover, Tunisia’s small traders working on the margins of society risk being pushed to breaking point.Meddeb said a recent law prohibiting the dismissal of workers for economic reasons during the pandemic was well-intentioned but has only served to postpone the coming storm, as wage bills remain fixed and the drastic drop in demand pushes Tunisian companies to the brink.In the meantime, illegal migration flourishes. Unlike the industrial human trade in nearby Libya – and, according to locals, from points north along the Tunisian coast where migrants make the trip on larger craft – migration from Zarzis remains very much an artisan affair. Fishermen in Zarzis, one of the country’s largest fishing ports, occasionally make their boats available to pilots, who will then steer the tiny craft to Italy, undisturbed by international radars. Given the huge scale of the sprawling port, passage is not hard to find.“Whereas in Libya the trafficking of migrants is managed by solid and structured criminal organisations, in Tunisia the smuggling racket is often run by groups of fishermen,” says Salvatore Vella, a prosecutor in Agrigento who is leading the investigations on alleged human trafficking from Tunisia to Sicily.“They take 70 to 80 people on board, and when they arrive within a few miles of the island, they put the passengers in small boats to complete the journey on their own. Then they return to the Tunisian coasts and carry on with their fishing activities. It sounds like smuggling has become an additional source of income for some Tunisian fishermen, as their earnings have also decreased because of the Covid emergency.”While images of Tunisians arriving in Italy apparently dressed for their holidays pulling suitcases on wheels and carrying poodles have provided ample fodder for the country’s right-wing commentators, there is little doubt of the poverty that grips many in Zarzis.Increasingly, entire families are among those departing, with more mothers and children now making the perilous 206-mile journey to connect with relatives already in Europe. Perhaps understandably, none of those approached by the  was willing to be quoted.However, Vella has no qualms about speaking up: “We are no longer witnessing exclusive arrivals of young people in search of a better future,” he says. “In the last few months, entire families have begun arriving at our shores, and from an array of social classes, even members of what we may describe as Tunisia’s middle class.“The impression is that the economic crisis caused by the pandemic has hit not only the poorest sectors of society, but also small- and medium-sized Tunisian businesspeople. They’re arriving with their pets and large suitcases, but not for a holiday. They’ve left their homes forever.”The preferred entry point for Tunisians is the island of Lampedusa, in Sicily, approximately 10 hours by boat from the coast of Zarzis. The arrival of thousands of Tunisians in recent weeks has led to overcrowding at the island’s welcome centre, which now holds more than 1,000 people. The majority of Tunisians who arrive at Lampedusa are transferred to Sicily, registered and then sent back to Tunisia on direct flights from Palermo to Tunis. Italy’s prime minister Giuseppe Conte has threatened to increase such repatriation flights in response to the high number of arrivals. Consequently, the only choice for many migrants is to flee from Sicilian welcome centres to avoid repatriation.Under pressure to act, the Tunisian government has launched measures aimed at stemming the flow of migrants from its shores. From 6 August, the country announced the deployment of naval units, surveillance devices, and search teams to patrol the waters around the country’s known departure points.“The situation has become unmanageable,” says Lampedusa’s mayor, Totò Martello. “If the government fails to proclaim a state of emergency for Lampedusa, then I will.”For an island that was once heralded for its welcoming of migrants, the wave of recent arrivals from Tunisia has worn thin the resolve of some islanders, who accuse the authorities of putting the management of the asylum seekers on citizens’ shoulders.In June Vella launched an investigation into an arson attack that destroyed the “migrant boats graveyard” of Lampedusa. Hundreds of dilapidated boats used over the years by migrants setting forth from North Africa were set ablaze, causing panic among islanders in what investigators believed was a political attack against the authorities – the latest in a series of attacks against pro-migrant symbols. Three days earlier, the monumental work “Gateway to Europe” was vandalised, designed by artist Mimmo Paladino in 2008 and a memorial to the migrants who perished while attempting the journey from North Africa to Europe.“There’s a parallel between the effect of the pandemic on the economy of Tunisia and the economic consequences in Sicily,” says Martello. “Even those who should welcome migrants, like us islanders, are in a bind because of the effects of the Covid crisis.”Elsewhere in Zarzis, within the city’s sweltering backstreets, Ridha showed the  round his home, pointing to the bed where he slept in the open, and the outhouse where his brother slept. Their mother lives in the house’s two threadbare rooms.With medical bills to pay for the family, Ridha has been offered free passage on condition he serves as mate to the boat’s skipper. The trip would provide him with the opportunity to send regular money home. He is aware of the penalties for trafficking, up to 10 years’ imprisonment according to a 2016 law, but in reality closer to six months, and is reluctant to make the trip.

Keep it simple and serve them on toast, or push the boat out and craft a pithivierNot everyone likes mushrooms. In fact, edible fungi come in such an extraordinary variety of tastes, textures and shapes that it is probably impossible to like all of them.Personally, I am not tempted by mushrooms that lie at either the extremely small or extremely large end of the size scale. I accept that a very big portobello mushroom can readily replace the meat portion of a burger – a simple but effective recipe for that can be found here – but it is not something I would do. Also, I am a little afraid of those enoki mushrooms with the long stems and tiny caps. They have the look of something that went wrong while the lights were off. What I am saying is: you can allow yourself a few irrational prejudices and still count yourself a mushroom enthusiast. I do.That said, I am guilty of sometimes trying to make mushrooms disappear: throwing them on top of a pizza, or into a stew, a pasta sauce or an omelette, chiefly because I have a sneaking feeling they have been in the fridge too long and a firm belief that they can’t do any harm. It may be time to fully embrace the idea of cooking with mushrooms deliberately.You don’t normally have to rinse mushrooms, but you certainly can if you feel they need it – just do it quickly, so they don’t soak up too much moisture. They already contain plenty of water – especially the ordinary white sort – which is why they can turn out soggy when you sauté them. Keeping the heat high should help the moisture evaporate.As quick, basic meals go, mushrooms on toast make for an elegant dish – “the best of the something-on-toasts”, as Nigel Slater puts it. Thankfully, this elegance is not a function of the effort involved. Add an egg and you have breakfast. Angela Hartnett’s version is like restaurant dining at home – and you could probably still manage it with a hangover. I would almost suggest you could manage it while drunk, but that is how accidents happen.Slater’s supper of mushrooms with ginger and coriander is just as quick to come together, as long as you have chopped up the garlic, ginger, chilli and spring onions before you start, as he suggests. Likewise, his spiced mushroom rice requires the preparation of a paste consisting of spinach, peanuts, red curry paste and groundnut oil. He also uses sushi rice, which needs to be soaked for half an hour first, but you can substitute basmati with no loss of face.I make Claire Saffitz’s mushroom pasta with prosciutto a lot, but I still watch the video tutorial every time, because I think the precise order of operations is the key to it. Like many of the recipes here, it calls for a general medley of fancy mushrooms – a combination of whatever happens to be available – in no particular proportions. Those “exotic mix” mushroom packs you often find in supermarkets are handy for this, but they are expensive and never quite enough – pad out the weight with some ordinary chestnut mushrooms, sliced.Thanks to their texture, mushrooms often take the place of meat in classic recipes. Jamie Oliver’s mushroom stroganoff is a case in point. (Again, the mix of mushrooms employed can stretch to anything your budget will allow.) The Doctor’s Kitchen does a mushroom bourguignon. In this rogan mushrooms recipe by Anjum Anand, mushrooms stand in for lamb. Yotam Ottolenghi’s mushroom lasagne adds the earthy intensity of rehydrated porcini mushrooms to the mix.Mushrooms also stand up well to baking. This can be as painless as an all-in-one oven breakfast of eggs, mushrooms and ham, slapped into a tray and baked until the egg is set. You can add spinach or kale to the mix without complicating it in the slightest.Lunch could be as robust as Slater’s baked mushrooms – four large field mushrooms upturned on a tray, their caps filled with tarragon and mustard butter – or as delicate as Dan Lepard’s mushroom and cheese soufflé. Rachel Roddy’s potato and mushroom bake has last-minute supper written all over it.With a block of puff pastry at your disposal, you can attempt Ottolenghi’s mushroom tarts with pine nut and parsley salsa. Each has a lid made from a whole portobello mushroom, pressed into the mixture skin-side down.Ottolenghi also offers this mushroom pithivier – a domed French pie – as another way of deploying mushrooms with puff pastry. Mary Berry, meanwhile, turns shop-bought pastry into a spinach and mushroom en croûte made with gruyère, ricotta and egg yolk. It can be prepared up to eight hours before you need to bake it. Berry’s recipe also contains some typically lapidary advice: “Never make an en croûte larger than for 12.” Words to live by.Finally, if your old mushrooms are too tired even to hide in a late-night omelette, Tom Hunt has a way to make use of them: mushroom ketchup. As long as they smell OK, your withered fungi can be combined with onion, garlic, nutmeg, vinegar and horseradish to concoct this 18th-century condiment. Kept in the fridge, it will extend the life of your mushrooms for another month, which should give you plenty of time to work out what to put it on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/781cf7478627fe553b95f493d6e49fa27890d1c6/0_263_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=97bdcdd403d0fbf333a258da64be93f7","title":"dmx woodstock 99 iconic festival set rap hip hop","story":"The rapper could have faced hostility at the overheated, febrile festival but capitalised on one of rap’s biggest ever audiences with a show of awesome powerEvery couple of weeks on Twitter someone posts a video clip of DMX’s performance at Woodstock ’99, usually with a wry caption (“DMX performed for planet earth. Goals”) that references the never-ending crowd, crossing their arms into a sea of Xs.Dripping with sweat and wearing a pair of beaten up Timberland boots and blood-red dungarees, the New York MC (real name Earl Simmons) growls viscerally before launching into raw hood anthems such as Get at Me Dog and Damien. The crowd of 200,000 mostly white concertgoers shout back combative lyrics such as: “What the fuck you gonna do  When we run up on you?” They sing along to Ruff Ryders Anthem as if it’s an American standard, rather than a song that’s been out only a year.It’s a surreal scene, especially given how much the star power of DMX, who has had high-profile run-ins with the law and battled substance misuse issues, has waned over recent years. Yet this performance immortalises a moment when he was the hottest rapper on the planet, a liberator who had come to free mainstream rap from its excesses with songs fully immersed in the struggle of being young, poor and black.Just over a year before, DMX had released his gripping debut It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot to critical acclaim and chart success, shifting US rap into a new direction. Following the murders of 2Pac and Biggie, the mainstream popularity of P Diddy was pushing the genre into what critics describe as the “shiny-suit era”. With the fatalism of gangster rap briefly pushed to the side, hip-hop turned to a lighter, goofier sound, with artists such as Jadakiss, Ma$e, Busta Rhymes and even Jay-Z following Diddy’s lead in wearing leather suits in opulent music videos that were almost exclusively directed by Hype Williams.For some, these videos showed how far US rappers had strayed from the working-class values their genre was borne out of. This backdrop meant DMX’s blunt, throaty raps, which almost exclusively dealt with the pressures of growing up in a project building in Yonkers, New York or finding twisted new ways to defeat his enemies, felt instantly radical. He addressed the shiny suits head on: “Y’all been eatin’ long enough now, stop being greedy!  Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy!”DMX quickly followed his impressive debut with the darker Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood, becoming the first debut artist to release two No 1 albums in the same year. Marilyn Manson was among its guest stars, and it cemented DMX’s superstardom and crossover appeal. “Pop music became a parody of itself in the 80s and then Nirvana came and brought the raw back DMX was the hip-hop equivalent of Nirvana,” DMX’s producer Dame Grease claimed in a 2018 interview with Okayplayer. “The ‘shiny suits’ era was dope as fuck, but millions of people were craving something more real and X was the only one brave enough to take them there.” Woodstock ’99 was DMX’s lap of honour.The festival is rightly looked back on as a chaotic disaster. In the 100-degree heat, the overbooked attendees felt as if they were being cooked. Water was expensive and in short supply, and it took over an hour to get from one stage to another. Rioting and violence resulted, with 44 arrests, 1,200 people being sent to the on-site medical facilities, and multiple women being sexually assaulted by a crowd that repeatedly screamed: “Get your tits out.”. With nu-metal bands including Limp Bizkit and Korn, as well as Wyclef Jean doing a naff Jimi Hendrix impression, Woodstock ’99 strayed a long way from the hippie ideals of its 1969 predecessor. The San Francisco Chronicle labelled it “the day the music died”.DMX mostly rose above it, delivering a performance that cemented street rap’s place on the biggest festival stages. Backed only by a DJ, he rips through his first two records without backing vocals or gimmicks. Amid the abrasive guitars of Fuckin Wit D, his voice sounds capable of moving mountains. Get at Me Dog is even more thrilling – there’s so much bite to his vocals it’s as if teeth are sinking into your ears.It’s uncomfortable to watch DMX rap bars such as “leave that hoe in plenty of back pain” while topless women in the crowd are fondled by strangers, and to watch thousands of white, Mountain-Dew swilling, nu-metal fans scream back the n-words in his lyrics. But the majority of the show has held up brilliantly. This was a time when rappers who played to white festival crowds were likely to be bottled with urine. The way DMX convulses across the Woodstock stage, in a performance more akin to a Bad Brains gig in a sweaty punk basement, shattered expectations.His set proved rappers could be rock stars, too, writing the blueprint for the punk rap theatrics of a new generation that included Denzel Curry, Slowthai, Rico Nasty, Bob Vylan, XXXTentacion, Tekashi 6ix9ine and Jpegmafia. Each has cited DMX as a major influence.One of DMX’s final songs, Slippin, is a slower, introspective church confessional, where the rapper compares his lifestyle to a stray dog: “Just another little nigga headed nowhere fast.” He forces the hundreds of thousands of suburban white kids in the crowd to consider the hopelessness and inequality in black America. He ends the show with a Kanye-like stream-of-consciousness prayer, and the fact he wasn’t booed is an indication of just how powerful this set was.DMX, who is working on new music having recently been to rehab, is unlikely ever to match the impact of his late-90s run, but this performance is a reminder of how important his legacy is. Maybe there’s a new DMX waiting in the wings, desperate to free mainstream rap from the perceived excesses of the Drake era. Watching him tear through that Woodstock ’99 stage could just be the inspiration they need."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2be7ab9601f5d23356bdb1c417f5be11c0fefcc/52_68_905_543/master/905.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a87f956ac3884a45f6fd89ab756e7b0","title":"trini lopez covid 19 frank sinatra dirty dozen","story":"Mexican-American was signed by Frank Sinatra, designed guitars for Gibson and had global hit in 1963 with If I Had a HammerMexican-American singer and actor Trini Lopez has died aged 83, after contracting Covid-19, at hospital in Rancho Mirage, California.As well as starring in the 1967 second world war war classic The Dirty Dozen as one of the eponymous gang, Lopez scored a transatlantic hit with If I Had a Hammer and designed a pair of sought-after guitar models for Gibson.Trinidad Lopez III was born in Dallas, Texas, to Mexican parents.

No other classical musician arouses such fanaticism, for and against. Almost all of his important works are operas, a form that he reinvented, and the main ones are written in an unbroken  of music. They are also very long.The two best-known pieces of music by Wagner could not be more different. This is worth remembering, since Wagner’s music is sometimes wrongly stereotyped as being merely loud. The Ride of the Valkyries is indeed loud – and warlike, too. Francis Ford Coppola used it to accompany a Vietnam war helicopter attack on a village in Apocalypse Now. The contrast with the quiet bridal chorus from the opera Lohengrin could not be greater. Better known as Here Comes the Bride, Wagner’s tune is used the world over at weddings.Richard Wagner was emphatically German. But Germany as we know it today did not exist when he was born in Leipzig in 1813. Wagner was the ninth child of Johanna and (probably) Friedrich Wagner, the Leipzig police registrar, who died that year. Johanna then married Ludwig Geyer, a painter, and the boy was known as Richard Geyer until he was 14. Fatherless sons, uncertain of their identity, would loom large in Wagner’s operas.The young Wagner secured short-term jobs in several German towns, during which he wrote his earliest operas (rarely performed even today) and married his first wife, Minna Planer. After periods in Riga and Paris, the couple made their home in Dresden, where Wagner had a success with his opera Rienzi, wrote The Flying Dutchman and Tannhäuser, began writing Lohengrin, and became music director for the Saxon court.A militant supporter of the revolutions of 1848, Wagner was forced to flee to Switzerland the following year. He spent the next decade composing his major mature works, as well as writing extensively. He also had a number of affairs, including with Mathilde Wesendonck, the wife of one of his main benefactors. His marriage broke up and his debts increased. Performances of his operas were rare, with the 1861 Paris premiere of the revised Tannhäuser a notable exception.In 1864, Wagner’s life turned two corners. The new king of Bavaria, Ludwig II, paid off the composer’s debts and commissioned performances of new operas, including Tristan und Isolde and Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. That same year, Wagner moved in with Cosima von Bülow, the daughter of the composer Franz Liszt, and began a family, settling in Lucerne. Here he resumed his four-opera Ring cycle (Der Ring des Nibelungen) after an 11-year hiatus and began plans for a special festival devoted to his operas.By 1871, Wagner had chosen the Bavarian town of Bayreuth as the festival location. The family moved and in 1876 the Ring received its first performance in the specially built theatre. The festival was an artistic sensation and a financial disaster for Wagner personally, from which Ludwig again rescued him. His health failing, Wagner now concentrated on completing his final opera Parsifal, which opened at Bayreuth in 1882. Wagner died in Venice the following February.Wagner lived through war, revolution and the rise of nationalism. When he was a young man, he took to the barricades in Dresden and was forced into political exile. In his later years, he became fiercely nationalistic, ardently welcoming the birth of the German nation state and empire.In a century of revolution, Wagner was himself a revolutionary of a special kind. Intoxicated by his ideal of ancient Greece, he placed music and theatre at the centre of an aspiration to remake the world with art and beauty at its centre. In his world view, the artist was the prophet and embodiment of the future. In his music this mythic vision reaches its climax at the close of the Ring cycle.Wagner’s views were shaped by philosophy and ideas in unmatched ways. In his early works (including the original conception of the Ring), he was heavily influenced by the socialistic writings of Ludwig Feuerbach. Later, these were eclipsed by the influence of Arthur Schopenhauer, whose interest in Buddhism and whose pessimistic view of an existence illuminated and redeemed by sex and art Wagner found personally congenial. This is embodied in the longing for death in Tristan und Isolde.In today’s terms it can be said that Wagner’s nationalism moved from the revolutionary left to the nativist right. His belief in the possibility of enlightenment through German art – which underlies Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg – is part of the explanation for his antisemitism. Towards the end of Wagner’s life, antisemitism became central to the whole culture of Bayreuth, and became even more virulent in the early 20th century.Wagner was part of a circle of 19th-century composers who looked for new ways of writing music, new ideas about harmony and orchestration (including new instruments) and new forms, especially in the dramatic marriage of the voice and the orchestra. Berlioz and Liszt were his peers, but neither of them envisaged anything as ambitious as the unified “complete art work” of music, drama and staging which Wagner aimed to create in the theatre at Bayreuth, above all in Parsifal.Wagner was the most influential musician of the era following Beethoven. His new use of harmony and his explicit attention to the sensuous nature of the musical experience broke away from older and more formal types of musical construction. To this day, the unresolved dissonance of the so-called “Tristan chord” at the beginning of Tristan und Isolde is often seen as the start of musical modernism.Wagner’s direct influence lasted for at least a century. Composers as different as Debussy, Schoenberg, Strauss and Elgar cannot be easily understood except in a post-Wagnerian context. All of them embraced (or struggled to differentiate themselves from) Wagner’s musical language.But the two main reasons why Wagner still matters are aesthetic and political. Wagner’s music, and its scale, means that any production of his operas require enormous artistic effort. Nowhere is this more true than of the four-opera Ring cycle, which took Wagner more than 20 years to complete. Performances of Wagner remain public artistic events. In that sense, he is the godfather of the modern rock festival.Wagner still matters, in a different way, because of the role that his operas played in Adolf Hitler’s Third Reich. The Nazis adopted Wagner as the embodiment of their racially inspired German supremacist cult. Bayreuth, in particular, bent the knee enthusiastically to Hitler. In spite of decades of increasingly radical and wholly non-nationalistic treatments of his work, including at Bayreuth, Wagner retains a political charge that no other composer can match, or would want.No one matters more in a Wagner performance than the conductor, who must have a sense of the music’s structure and textures that makes sense both at key moments and over long arcs. Historically, the greatest name here is Wilhelm Furtwängler, who makes the works surge and cohere like no other. Among contemporary conductors, Daniel Barenboim comes closest to Furtwängler. Georg Solti’s Ring cycle remains an all-time classic studio recording, as does Carlos Kleiber’s Tristan und Isolde. But, in the really distant past, the almost complete performance of act three of Parsifal under Karl Muck, recorded in Berlin in 1927-8, is a treasure beyond price.Singers matter almost as much. Earlier generations revered sopranos Kirsten Flagstad and Frida Leider, tenor Lauritz Melchior and bass-baritone Friedrich Schorr. Their recordings all still provide thrilling listening, especially Melchior with Lotte Lehmann on the complete Die Walküre act one under Bruno Walter in 1935. In the early stereo recording era, Birgit Nilsson and Astrid Varnay lead the soprano stakes, with Jon Vickers and René Kollo among the best tenors and Hans Hotter supreme in the bass roles. Among today’s Wagnerian specialists, Nina Stemme, Jonas Kaufmann and Bryn Terfel are often the equals and more of the giants of the past.Wagner operas are long. On first listening, it is easy to get lost in what is happening. It really is worth persevering, and getting the hang of Wagner’s style, especially his symbolic yet malleable leitmotiv themes. Listen again and it will come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a022b40ae5621673e29b294ee398d5267578d5b5/0_0_3853_2431/master/3853.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=723c5edc9f4be85bc1ced8a85a79d073 1760w","title":"caring for my dad felt like something that had happened to me not a choice i made","story":"Like many other women, I started having to help my dad a little, then a lot, and before I knew it someone was calling me a carerOne night in early 2016, I found myself calling for an ambulance. My father had locked himself in the toilet for four hours and wasn’t responding to anyone. My brother and I listened at the door. Nothing. The person at the other end of the 999 call had a volley of questions: “Why did he choose the toilet? Does he have a weapon? Do you think he is suicidal?” I replied with don’t know, no and no. They wanted his rejection of life to be defined as an absolute, but it was far more shadowy and ambiguous.Panicked, I called a mental health crisis helpline too, who advised me to connect with my father through the toilet door. “Speak louder, put some force into the words,” he told me, as though I was auditioning for a part. My dad did not reply. It had been hours since I had last heard his voice, fragile, fading to a whisper. My younger brother was trying his best to help. After rummaging through a toolbox, he found a screwdriver to force between door and lock. White flakes of paint flew the door swung open and there was my father. He was wearing his pyjamas, standing upright, his body locked into a strange, repetitive loop. His left arm would rise, jerk above his head, then his right foot would lift, and the mechanical process would begin all over again. His face was scarlet, screwed into a fist of agony.When the ambulance crew arrived, we had difficulty communicating his illness. Catatonia, we explained, uncertainty in our voices. Even his doctors seemed puzzled by the state he had become prone to slipping into: a sort of waking coma, where he was conscious but his body became disconnected. In the days that followed, he was sectioned in a psychiatric ward. He could not walk, eat, speak or see, only hear. The nurses were feeding him but I worried about him becoming dehydrated, and when I visited I took along a bottle of fancy juice, put a straw into his mouth and coaxed him to drink. The sight of liquid seeping up the straw, the sound of it against his teeth and tongue, was a wild relief. It was also one of the few ways I could reach through the bars of his catatonia cage and find a way to communicate. His fists kept flying up involuntarily and hammering on the arms of his chair. I held his hands tight and spoke to him of better times, when he would be well again it was also a way of reassuring myself. The last time he’d had a catatonic collapse, he’d taken months to heal. There was no certainty that he would recover on this occasion.“Are you his carer?” It was a question that I kept being asked around this time. I usually replied: “Well, no, I’m his daughter.” I found the term carer puzzling and wondered why people were trying to pin it on to me. It made me think of nurses, white gowns, Florence Nightingale it made me feel I ought to have specialist medical knowledge and infinite reserves of compassion. Of course, I did care about my father I was desperately worried about him. But I did not consider myself as someone worthy of an official title of responsibility. I was in my late 30s, based in the north, a full-time writer, living a peripatetic, financially precarious existence. My father was in his early 70s and lived in London, alone after the death of my mother, his days bookended by the taking of medicines and filled with quiet habits: reading the paper, doing the odd shop, cooking himself a poached egg for dinner each night.He fell ill when I was three years old. He had always been a playful, loving father. Subsequently he seemed lost to us. He had been sectioned after being made redundant and suffering a nervous breakdown during his stay in the psychiatric ward, he developed schizophrenia. Open a textbook and you’ll find a list of symptoms for the illness – withdrawal, loss of desires, hallucinations, hearing voices – but it affects each person differently. For us, there was a sense of my father withdrawing from the world, becoming a silent, mysterious observer, almost wraithlike.With my father now back in the psychiatric ward, I tried to visit him every day. I liaised with doctors, played Scrabble with him, read to him from the paper, took bags of his clothes home, washed them, carried them back. The nights grew shorter, daffodils springing up on the lawns that framed the ward. The day he started speaking again was euphoric: the first major sign of recovery. Before my mother had died, my relationship with him had been virtually non-existent. Now I found myself becoming closer to him, discovering what a kind and sweet man he was beneath his quiet persona. A tenderness blossomed between us.As he grew better, I went into decline. My workload was heavy. By the end of each day I wanted to curl up foetal in bed with exhaustion, and the walk to the bus stop, the start of my journey to visit him, became a trudge.It was a lonely time. My partner of three years was based in the north, anchored there by his daughter from a previous relationship. Insomnia set in. I would wake in the early hours, worried about Dad, about work deadlines I was failing to meet on four or five hours sleep I fumbled through white-fuzz days. If I was a carer, I thought, then I’m failing at this task. It was a relief when, one night on the ward, I heard a man cheerfully saying to his sick wife: “I’m glad they’ve let me change my shifts, when I was on night duty visiting you every day nearly killed me.” Eventually, I cut back on work in order to devote more time to my father, but then my finances suffered. Bankruptcy became a genuine threat.When my father was released, the relief came: now life can go back to normal. But a few months later, I was working downstairs at the dining table when I heard the sound of water pitter-pattering on the floor. My father had been at the sink, washing his hands, when he collapsed into catatonia. As I returned to a routine of visits and doctors’ discussions, my relationship collapsed. By choosing to stay south for the past year, I had put my father ahead of my boyfriend. It had not felt like a conscious decision. Caring had always felt like something that happened to me, not a choice I’d made. I realised that life was never going to be “normal” again.My father is much better these days, for I have moved in with him permanently. There are times when I feel sad about my love life being compromised, days when I wish I had the freedom to travel or live abroad, but I cherish the close bond between us and the fierce, protective love for him that has taken root in my heart. Being called a carer is something I have grown used to.• Sam Mills is author of The Fragments of My Father: A Memoir of Madness, Love and Being a Carer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfdc1cfc37f975b456e95a1d2a543886a9f0de53/0_112_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d742c892cede1b6570c8a56b7f8e83e5","title":"hull fc and salford sit out weekend games due to covid positive tests super league rugby","story":"Hull FC and Salford have stood down from their Super League fixtures this weekend due to a series of positive Covid-19 tests at Hull, with the competition’s schedule completely reworked to enable four matches to still take place and the season to continue.Five Hull players who featured in their 54-18 loss to Salford on Sunday – as well as another first-team player and two coaches – tested positive for the virus after the game, and their squad has now entered self-isolation as a result. The Red Devils have also placed their playing and coaching staff into quarantine until a further round of testing this weekend, after track and trace analysis of the match between the sides showed 11 of their players must also now isolate.No Salford player has yet tested positive, but the competition has acted swiftly to ensure a round of fixtures takes places without the two sides this weekend. Hull’s meeting with Castleford and Salford’s game with Catalans are both off, but there will be two games on Saturday – Wakefield versus Catalans and Huddersfield against Warrington – before St Helens play Castleford and Wigan face Leeds on Sunday afternoon.“Throughout this crisis our priority has been to ensure we minimise any risk, and the postponement of this weekend’s scheduled fixtures involving Hull FC and Salford underlines that approach,” Robert Elstone, the Super League chief executive, said. “It left us with another challenging situation, but it is a credit to the solidarity of the Super League clubs who agreed to adjust the fixture list at such short notice.”The clubs held an emergency meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss the issue, with the timing of testing now likely to come under scrutiny. At present, players are tested early in the week, with the results made public on Fridays. But with one Hull player contracting the virus away from training before bringing it into the club, there is now likely to be a shift, with calls growing for an extra round closer to the weekend fixtures.Costing may well be an obstacle, but one chief executive told the  that this is “exactly what the sport’s emergency £16m loan from the Government should be used for”. Moving the testing to the end of the week is also being discussed, with the sport’s administrators acutely aware that more issues like this could not only lead to the season being cancelled, but also have grave financial ramifications should the game not fulfil its obligations with the host broadcaster Sky Sports."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f68fc7a05fb7d80c40a36a3b494d7f9990d8c3/2_0_3020_1814/master/3020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ad68d275faf87789a22a7f4ba78decb","title":"premiership rugby union restart club by club guide comings and goings 2019 20","story":"The season will resume on Friday and, with nine rounds left and two play-off weekends to follow, there is plenty to play for  Position 6thSlap in the middle of the table, the play-offs are five points one way and Leicester (or relegation any other year) 10 points the other. The arrival of Ben Spencer is the most notable boost since the suspension of play, the retirement of Francois Louw the most significant loss. But Taulupe Faletau has signed a long-term contract and – with Sam Underhill, Zac Mercer et al chomping at the bit – back-row is not an obvious problem area.Position 3rdThe new hawks. Where once Leicester, Saracens and the like used to complain about the constraints of any salary cap at all, now it is Steve Lansdown, Bristol’s billionaire owner, who has resisted the new calls for a tightening of it. Easy to see why. Bristol, nestled in the top four, now unveil Semi Radradra and Kyle Sinckler to their increasingly adoring fans. They reckon Bristol is the biggest rugby city in the world. After 25 years of turbulence in the professional era, it is time to make that count.Position 1stAll eyes, or perhaps ears, will be on Sandy Park when humans are eventually allowed into the stadium – and how fans will respond to the controversy over the Tomahawk Chop and other Native American themes. For now, the Chiefs remain defiant over their branding but BT will not be including the chant in their “fake” crowd noise. On the field, Exeter continue to set the pace. Johnny Gray is the next big signing but his fellow Scot Sam Hidalgo-Clyne could be the most interesting as he tries to resurrect his international career.Position 9thIt may technically be round 14 of the old season, but at Kingsholm it feels very much like August and a whole new start. The previous regime has walked out, despite flirting at times with consistency more closely than their most recent predecessors. Still, ninth is ninth, however quickly a couple of wins might fix that. George Skivington and Alex King, of Wasps fame, lead the new team. How the latter dovetails with his old protege, Danny Cipriani, will be pivotal. The return of Jonny May should do more again to revitalise the club.Position 7thAnother side who know all about the fine line between play-offs and relegation, there is a feeling of the fresh about Harlequins this mid-season too. Chris Robshaw has agreed to tarry until the official end of this season, but Kyle Sinckler has led quite the exodus of squad players. Three big South African signings mitigate that, as does the return from New Zealand of Joe Marchant and from injury of Nathan Earle. Chris Ashton, signed from Sale just before lockdown, is another ingredient. As ever with Quins, if the chemistry fizzes they will play a part, possibly even in the play-offs.Position 11thThe good news is, they are safe from relegation. And, in Steve Borthwick, they have a new head coach. But they’ve had loads of those recently and it never seems to make much difference. The bad news is, they handled the Covid “realignment” of wages as awkwardly as anyone, eliciting resentment among many of their players, five of whom upped and left, to join 20-plus others leaving anyway. The Tuilagi era is over, with Manu’s departure for Sale, but the Nadolo era begins, as Nemani, even bigger of stature, strides in. The rest of this season is for little more than experimentation.Position 8thThe Exiles return to London. They will ground-share with Harlequins for the rest of this season, before moving into their new home in Brentford at the start of next. They are very much in the running for a place in Europe next season, whatever that may look like. They will incorporate into their campaign Rob Simmons, the Wallabies centurion who should team up well with his compatriot Adam Coleman. Sean O’Brien will lend added international class now that his injury problems have cleared up.Position 4thWhatever Leicester didn’t do, Northampton, their perennial Midlands rivals, managed with some style. All of their post-Covid negotiations were completed with an aplomb that has become their hallmark on the field. The transformation of the Saints from the dysfunctional end of the Jim Mallinder era has been swift under Chris Boyd. He is a man of class, and his team are similarly impressive. They occupy the fourth of the play-off spots and should be disappointed if they don’t finish at least as high as that.Position 2ndWhat salary crisis? Sale had already, in the space of barely an off-season, shot from some way beneath the cap to wedged up tightly against its underside. Now they have signed Manu Tuilagi, who presumably came at a discount but can’t have been cheap. It seems to be working. They haven’t threatened the top end of the table like this since the days of that other expensively assembled squad of theirs, the one that became English champions in 2006. Not even that vintage could unleash anything like Tuilagi and RJ van Rensburg at humble domestic midfields. Ouch.Position 12thTalk about nothing to play for. Under normal circumstances Saracens would be three points off Exeter in second place as it is, they are 83 points adrift at the bottom. Their season amounts to a Champions Cup quarter-final against Leinster in Dublin and any progress they can make beyond that. There is a certain irony that their squad is remaining largely intact, bar the odd loan for their season away, despite its apparent violation of every norm known to society. Otherwise, their next 12 months will prove a test case for the ideal management of international rugby players.Position 5thLife after Dai Young continues with Wasps handily placed just outside the top four. There has been noticeably little movement in or out, despite the loss of their director of rugby just before lockdown. Ryan Mills is an excellent signing, but no one’s idea of a marquee. He is the most high-profile arrival, with a couple more rumoured. Few have been out the door either, but the loss of the Springbok back-row forwards Nizaam Carr and Ashley Johnson might hurt. They resume at Franklin’s Gardens against Northampton, in fourth.Position 10thRealistically there is not much on offer this season to the Warriors, but there is a sense of future planning and the securing of some roots at Sixways. Jonathan Thomas has returned to his former club, in whose environs he and his family have continued to live, from Bristol and will become the forwards coach. Ted Hill, the highly promising back-row forward, has been appointed club captain at the age of 21. Matt Kvesic is back, too. And should further inspiration be required, the return to mobility of Michael Fatialofa following his neck injury will supply it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d31c285563aca9af7d33ae71c0fdfc5d9a302e15/4_0_4682_2811/master/4682.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba23af0efa2c7e908d7794c1a78a842c","title":"facebook struggled to remove sensitive content under covid lockdown","story":"Fewer pieces of suicide, child nudity and exploitation content were removed after staff were sent homeFacebook has admitted it struggled to remove content that promoted suicide or exploited children after global lockdowns forced it to rely more heavily on automatic moderation.Facebook sent many of its content reviewers home in March and began focusing on AI-driven moderation. In its first quarterly report on its moderation practices since the coronavirus crisis took hold, the company set out some of the successes and failures of that approach.“We rely heavily on people to review suicide and self-injury and child exploitative content, and help improve the technology that proactively finds and removes identical or near-identical content that violates these policies,” said Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice-president of integrity.“With fewer content reviewers, we took action on fewer pieces of content on both Facebook and Instagram for suicide and self-injury, and child nudity and sexual exploitation on Instagram.”According to the report, Facebook removed 479,400 pieces of content from Instagram for violating rules on child exploitation and nudity between April and June, down from 1 million in the previous three months.Content that broke rules about suicide and self-harm was removed from Instagram 275,000 times over the same period, down from 1.3m the quarter before.Not every moderation goal was similarly affected, though. Adult nudity, which is increasingly easy for companies such as Facebook to automatically flag and remove using machine vision tools, was removed from Facebook 37.5m times, down slightly from 39.5m in the first quarter of the year.Hate speech removals, by contrast, were hugely up. In the first three months of 2020, Facebook acted on 9.6m pieces of content over hate speech violations, and in the second quarter that more than doubled, to 22.5m posts, videos and photos.As well as the standard challenges of working from home, Facebook had to deal with other problems as it gradually built up its moderators’ capacity for remote working. Mark Zuckerberg said in March that the company faced data protection issues, which meant it could not allow some contractors to work on their own devices.Mental health concerns also limited the company’s ability to fully shift work remotely, Zuckerberg said. Some of the most distressing work would only be done by full-time staff who were still able to enter the office, since the infrastructure required to provide mental health support to contractors working remotely was not in place. That constraint appears to have been what limited the company’s ability to respond to suicidal content and child exploitation material during the pandemic.In the long term, Facebook has committed to embracing remote working even after the pandemic cools. In May, Zuckerberg said he expected that about half the company’s workforce would be remote by 2030.“We need to do this in a way that’s thoughtful and responsible, so we’re going to do this in a measured way,” he said. “But I think that it’s possible that over the next five to 10 years – maybe closer to 10 than five, but somewhere in that range – I think we could get to about half of the company working remotely permanently.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2c31534292809b24a88140ab49a3f819f727dc2/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=43a45e802a32afa878a2f403f20f12f1","title":"us doctors covid 19 new york houston","story":"Two emergency room doctors in New York and Houston discuss their cities’ coronavirus outbreaksHealth workers across the country looked on in horror when New York became the global center of the coronavirus. Now, as physicians in cities such as Houston, Phoenix and Miami face their own Covid-19 crises, they are looking to New York, where the caseload has since abated, for guidance.  spoke with two emergency room physicians – one in New York and the other in Houston – about what happened when Covid arrived at their hospitals.Dr Cedric Dark, Houston: When did you start worrying about how Covid-19 would impact New York?Dr Tsion Firew, New York: Back in February, I traveled to Sweden and Ethiopia for work. There was some sort of screening for Covid-19 in both places. On 22 February I came to New York City, and nothing – no screening. At that point, I thought, I don’t think this country’s going to handle this well.Dark: On 26 February, at a department meeting, one of my colleagues put coronavirus on the agenda. I thought to myself, Why do we even need to bother with this here in Houston? This is in China, maybe it’s in Europe?Firew: On 1 March, we had our first case in New York City, which was at my hospital. Fast-forward 15 days and I get a call saying, “Hey, you were exposed to Covid-positive patients.” I was told to stay home.Dark: My anxiety grew as I saw what was happening in Italy, a country I’ve visited several times. I remember seeing images of people dying in their homes and mass graves. I started to wonder, Is this what we’ll see over here? Are my colleagues going to be dying? Is this something that’s going to get me or my wife, who’s also an ER doctor? Are we going to bring it home to our son?In March, we repurposed our urgent care pod, which has eight beds, into our coronavirus unit. And for a while, that was enough.Firew: In late March, health workers without symptoms were told to come back to work. It felt like a tsunami hit. I’ve practiced in very low-resource settings and even in a war zone, and I couldn’t believe what I was witnessing in New York.The emergency department was silent – there were no visitors, and patients were very sick. Many were on ventilators or getting oxygen. The usual human interactions were gone. Everybody was wearing a mask and gowns and there were so many people who came to help from different places that you didn’t know who was who. I spent a lot more time on the phone talking to family members about end-of-life care decisions, conversations you’d normally have face-to-face.In New York, the severity of the crisis really depended on what hospital you were at. Columbia has two hospitals – one at 168th and one at 224th – and the difference was night and day. The one on 224th is smaller and just across the bridge from the Bronx, which was hit hard by the virus. There, people were dying in ambulances while waiting for care. The emergency department was overwhelmed with patients who needed oxygen. Its hallways were crowded with patients on portable oxygen tanks. We ran out of monitors and oxygen for the portable tanks. Staff members succumbed to Covid-19, exacerbating shortages of nurses and doctors.My friends who work in lower Manhattan couldn’t believe some of the things we saw.Dark: I went to medical school at NYU and have a lot of friends in New York I was checking in with at the time. I thought that in Houston, a city that’s almost as big, we had the conditions for a similar crisis: it’s a large city with an international airport, it attracts a lot of business travelers, and thousands of people come here each March for the rodeo.In late March, a guy about my age came into the hospital. It was the first day we got coronavirus tests. A few days later a nurse texted me that the patient had tested positive. He hadn’t traveled anywhere – it was proof to me that we had community transmission in Houston before any officials admitted it.Firew: In early April, I became sick, along with my husband. I never imagined that in 2020 I would be writing out a living will detailing my life insurance policy to my family. Walking from my bed to the kitchen would make my heart race I often wondered: is this when I drop dead like my patient the other day?A few days before I got sick, the president had said that anybody who wanted a test could get one. But then I was on the phone with my workplace and with the department of health begging for a test.It was also around that time that a brown-skinned physician who was about my age died from Covid-19. So I knew being in my mid-30s wouldn’t protect me. I was even more worried when my husband became ill because as a Black man, his chances of dying from this disease were much higher than mine. We both recovered, but I still have some fatigue and shortness of breath.When did cases pick up in Houston?Dark: We saw a gradual increase in cases throughout April, but it stayed relatively calm because the city was shut down. The hospital was kind of a ghost town because no one was having elective procedures. Things were quiet until Texas reopened in May.I remember when I lost my first Covid patient. He started to crash right in front of me. We started CPR and I ran the algorithms through my mind trying to think how we could bring him back, but kept ending up at the same conclusion: this is Covid and there’s nothing I can do.It’s like serving on the frontlines of a war. We initially struggled to find our own personal protective equipment while the hospitals worked to secure the supply chain. Although that situation has stabilized, a lot of patients who come in for non-Covid reasons wind up testing positive. Covid is everywhere.Our patient population is heavily Latino and Black, and for a time, our hospital had some of the highest numbers of Covid cases among the nearly two dozen hospitals in the Texas medical center network. It’s revealed the fault lines of a pre-existing issue in terms of inequities in healthcare.As area hospitals fill up, they reallocate additional floors to Covid patients. Who knows, if we don’t get this under control, maybe one day the whole hospital will be Covid.Firew: Now I’m just chronically angry. The negligence came from the top all the way down. Our leaders do not lead with evidence – we knew what was going to happen when states reopened so quickly.How are things in New York now?Firew: There have been several days where I’ve seen zero Covid cases. If I do see a case, it’s usually someone who has traveled from abroad or other states.People are coming in for non-Covid reasons. Recently, a woman in her early 40s came in with a massive lesion on her breast. She’d started experiencing some pain three months ago, during the peak of the pandemic, and was too frightened to come to the hospital. To make matters worse, she didn’t have insurance and couldn’t afford the telehealth that many had access to.By the time she made it to our hospital, the mass had metastasized to her spine and lungs. Even with aggressive treatment, she likely only has a few months to live. This is one of the many cases we’re seeing now that we are back to “normal”– complications of chronic illnesses and delayed diagnoses of cancer. The burden of the pandemic layered with a broken healthcare system.This conversation has been condensed and edited."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83768bfc411ce4daa3c2497111d9c28f5160f662/0_153_4563_2738/master/4563.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09202c8ff13dd00800cf8aba4d837fec","title":"we did the right thing sadness and uncertainty in auckland as covid returns","story":"Shoppers rush to stock up on essentials as new lockdown starts for New Zealand’s largest city following mystery Covid outbreakIt was the storm before the calm.In the hours immediately before Auckland went into level 3 lockdown at noon on Wednesday, the city’s roads were full, queues snaked outside supermarkets and toilet paper flew off the shelves once more.People hurried to stock up and carry out last-minute tasks in the knowledge that the luck for one of the very few countries that appeared to have contained coronavirus had changed.Mary Robson, 77, said having to remain indoors again was sad “but it’s a wise decision.

Robson handed a fish merchant $5 – all the cash she had with her – only to be given a bag of fillets and her money back.“Kiwi spirit,” said Robson, a widow of 45 years, “I love it.”She was shopping at Manukau City, the commercial hub of south Auckland, home to four people from the same family whose positive tests for Covid-19 prompted the new stage 3 lockdown.Among other shoppers, brothers Des and Dave Wilson wore masks that Dave said were made from “rags out of the bin” because he hadn’t had the chance to buy any. Going into lockdown again was a shock but had to be done, said Dave. “It was going to happen.”“And,” added his brother, “by the sound of it, there’s going to be a lot more than four cases.”News of four positive cases of community transmission – with no known recent overseas travel or contact with anyone in a quarantine facility – comes after 102 days without a fresh local case.Complicating the situation, two of the family to test positive work in other parts of Auckland, at companies with 130 and 160 employees, and a third visited Rotorua last weekend, where she visited family and tourist attractions.The mood in Auckland was more resignation than outrage, although a few of more than a dozen people who spoke to the  said New Zealand should have had locked the border without exception – hard luck for returning Kiwis and those wanting to come for compassionate reasons such as funerals.Jacqueline Pickering had told two of her children to stay put in Perth, Australia rather than return home because she thought that was safest for all.“We did the right thing and stayed in lockdown last time. We spoke to neighbours by yelling across the street. Now this.”Pickering said these new circumstances would be particularly hard for people who suffer anxiety and depression.Also in South Auckland, Debbie James said it was upsetting after the country had done so well. “It’s the uncertainty of it. I feel a bit more anxious.“There will be a lot of families that are going to find it really hard financially going into lockdown a second time. There will be depression and family violence. These are things that are affected by something like this.”Most expect the new lockdown (New Zealand locked down from March to early June) will be more than the three days initially indicated.“I’m not shocked but I am sad, given what we had,” said Peti Lamoni, a welder, who was doing his shopping across the city in Mt Albert where a child from the infected family reportedly goes to school.Lamoni, who wore a mask provided by his employer, thought the government had done an excellent job. “Look at our neighbours, Australia, look around the world. It’s not easy.”In nearby Mt Eden, shopper Joanna Mitchell said there was a sense of solidarity in the supermarket, where most shoppers were wearing masks.“There was a feeling of being in this together,” she said.Mitchell was there buying food supplies, but was staying away from some staple grocery items. “We’re actually quite low on toilet paper but I couldn’t face being seen buying any so we will just have to survive with what we’ve got.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55a83bd70151b0f8091b9444ed5a8e576bb7bb71/16_0_3799_2282/master/3799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9b74d6156fbd61980bf09b7bff695f2","title":"coronavirus live news lebanon sees record cases after blast as new zealands biggest city heads into lockdown","story":"Germans told to keep guard up against virus France cancels marathon as cases pick up four new cases in AucklandUzbekistan will lift its second lockdown starting from Saturday, the government said, promising to restore most services in the central Asian country within days in order to revive the economy.The government reintroduced a lockdown last month, after lifting restrictions in June led to a surge in new Covid-19 cases, leaving hospitals struggling to cope.On Saturday, people will be allowed to drive their cars again and hold ceremonies such as weddings for up to 30 guests at their homes.

Vaping may be associated with a five to seven times increased risk of Covid-19 among US teenagers and young adults, a study published on Tuesday suggests.Researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine analysed nationally representative survey data collected in May from 4,351 participants aged 13-24 years. The findings were published in the Journal of Adolescent Health.“Young people may believe their age protects them from contracting the virus or that they will not experience symptoms of Covid-19, but the data show this isn’t true among those who vape,” study leader Shivani Mathur Gaiha said.Participants were asked if they had ever used vaping devices or combustible cigarettes, whether they had vaped or smoked in the past 30 days, and if they had experienced Covid-19 symptoms, been tested for Covid-19 or been diagnosed with the infectious disease.Participants who had used both cigarettes and e-cigarettes in the previous 30 days were 4.7 times more likely to experience Covid-19 symptoms compared with those who never smoked or vaped.Among people tested for Covid-19, those who used just e-cigarettes were five times more likely to get a positive Covid-19 test result. Those who had ever used both e-cigarettes and cigarettes were seven times more likely to be diagnosed with Covid-19, the study found.The study cannot prove that vaping causes Covid-19. The researchers note, however, that vaping involves the repeated touching of hands to the mouth and face, which is associated with the spread of Covid-19. Further, exposure to nicotine and other chemicals in e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes causes lung damage.The researchers hope their findings will prompt the US Food and Drug Administration to effectively regulate e-cigarettes during the Covid-19 pandemic. Sicilian holidaymakers returning from Greece, Spain and Malta will be tested for coronavirus, regional authorities said on Wednesday. On Tuesday Sicily registered its highest number of new Covid-19 cases, 89, followed by Lombardy (68) and Veneto (65).“We have serious concerns about what is happening in Malta, Greece and Spain,” said Sicily’s president Nello Musumeci. Sicilians who return from these three countries will be placed under a ‘voluntary quarantine’ and at the end of which they will be tested for coronavirus. It is a sacrifice that we necessarily have to ask.Romanian prime minister Ludovic Orban has pledged schools will re-open in September under strict hygiene rules, as the country continues to fight a spike in the number of coronavirus cases.“Our decision is clear, schools will start on 14 September”, Orban said during a speech in parliament.He mentioned that students, teachers and other school staff will have to wear masks and that disinfectants should be available at all times.Romania closed schools, kindergartens and universities in March to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and subsequently decided to keep them shut for the rest of the academic year.Since then, Romania has faced a jump in the number of infections, which on Wednesday reached a new daily record with 1,415 cases reported in the last 24 hours.So far a total of 65,177 people have been infected in Romania and 2,807 have died, according to government data.Orban clarified that local authorities could decide to keep some schools shut if there were more then three new infections per 1,000 inhabitants in a particular area.In that scenario students would then have to attend lessons online from home.The government has promised to buy 250,000 tablets for students who can’t afford one and need it for online lessons, but according to NGOs several times that number would be needed in order to match demand.Meanwhile, the opposition Social Democrats (PSD) says they plan to bring a vote of no-confidence in Orban’s government next week over what it says are failures in the response to the pandemic.Germany’s government has urged citizens to keep their guard up and stick to public health guidelines, as new Covid-19 infections hit a three-month high and schools reopened in the country’s most populous state.Germany’s response so far has widely been seen as successful in slowing the spread of the virus efficiently and quickly, but the country’s disease control authority on Wednesday reported 1,226 new infections. That was the highest number since early May, although the figure has topped 1,000 on several days recently.Health minister Jens Spahn said smaller and mid-sized outbreaks have occurred in almost all regions, largely driven by travellers returning from abroad and people partying or having family gatherings.“This is worrying, without doubt,” Spahn told Deutschlandfunk radio. “And it can naturally lead to a new dynamic, if we don’t all now exercise caution.”In the early days of the pandemic the average age of people infected was 50 it is now 34.Germany has recorded 218,519 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 9,207 deaths, according to the Robert Koch Institute, the national disease control center. At the height of the pandemic in early April, there were about 6,000 new cases each day.Many of the current new infections were people who contracted the virus during visits to the western Balkans, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland and Spain, the Robert Koch Institute said.The uptick comes as students are returning to school across the country, adding to concerns.Some 2.5 million children were returning to school on Wednesday in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, which has the strictest rules in the country including that students above elementary school age must wear masks at all times, including in class.The eastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, which has seen the country’s lowest number of coronavirus infections, took a different approach when it became the first state to send children back to school on 3 August, with no mask regulations or social distancing rules. It was forced to temporarily close two schools four days later after a student from one and teacher from the other tested positive for Covid-19.In Brandenburg, where school resumed Monday, a child and a worker at an after-school programme tested positive on Wednesday and authorities were awaiting test results for 68 people who had been in contact with them.And in Schleswig-Holstein in the country’s north, where students also went back to class on Monday, a primary school was almost immediately shut down after a teacher tested positive, though it was expected to soon reopen. Two grades at a second school were also sent home on Wednesday as a precaution after a student’s sibling tested positive.Tourism giant TUI and the German government have agreed to a second massive aid package, in a sign of how the effects of the coronavirus pandemic are still battering the industry.The Hanover-based company agreed to a €1.2bn ($1.4bn) package with German public lender KfW, intended to bolster the firm through its winter 202021 season.The new funds add to the €1.8bn government loan that the company agreed to in April.The company previously announced that it would cut 8,000 jobs worldwide to reduce costs.TUI’s hotels, flights and cruise ships were empty at the height of worldwide lockdowns and have struggled to reopen as major destinations such as Spain have seen virus infections spike and been subjected to further quarantines.CEO Fritz Joussen said the group had already introduced “massive cost reductions in good time and implemented them quickly and consistently”.“However, no one knows at present when a vaccine or medication will be available and what effects the pandemic will have in inidual markets in the coming months,” Joussen added.“Therefore it is right and important to take further precautions together with the German government.”The grandmother of Brazil’s first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro, has reportedly died of Covid-19.Maria Aparecida Firmo Ferreira, 81, died in a hospital in the capital Brasília in the early hours of Wednesday, according to Brazilian media.“We’re all very shaken,” the first lady’s aunt told the news website Metrópoles.Ferreira was admitted to hospital at the start of July after collapsing in the street on the outskirts of the capital.Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has drawn international condemnation for his chaotic handling of the epidemic, which has now killed more than 103,000 Brazilians, as well as his wife’s grandmother.Despite the huge number of deaths - the second highest toll after the US - Bolsonaro has been criticised for failing to offer words of comfort to the families of victims.“We’re sorry about all the deaths but that’s everyone’s destiny,” Brazil’s far-right leader told reporters in June. School leaving exams were cancelled, postponed or adapted because of the coronavirus crisis in countries across Europe, but most have avoided the rows, recriminations and abrupt about-turns experienced in the UK.In 1977 Scott Halstead, a virologist at the University of Hawaii, was studying dengue fever when he noticed a now well-known but then unexpected feature of the disease.Animals that had already been exposed to one of the four closely-related viruses that cause dengue and produced antibodies to it, far from being protected against other versions became sicker when infected a second time, and it was the antibodies already produced by the first infection that were responsible, allowing the second infection to hitchhike into the body.The effect was called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The reason it matters today, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, is because unexpected glitches like ADE are the kind of problems vaccine developers look for in phase 3 testing of vaccines – testing which has yet to be carried out on Russia’s newly-approved Sputnik V vaccine.In recent weeks, as announcements on development of scores of vaccines around the world have come in rapid succession, the still poorly understood mechanisms of ADE have been thrust into the spotlight as scientists speculate whether vaccine-produced antibodies could trigger this effect.ADE “is a genuine concern”, virologist Kevin Gilligan, a senior consultant with Biologics Consulting, told Nature Biotechnology in June. “Because if the gun is jumped, and a vaccine is widely distributed that is disease enhancing, that would be worse than actually not doing any vaccination at all.”This week, following Russia’s announcement that it is pushing ahead with mass production of Sputnik V and mass inoculation, the fears expressed by the likes of Gilligan became a chorus, underlining the genuine concerns among scientists that Russian researchers had jumped the gun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/820b48532cfd4d2b39fac81c595ab7688beae402/0_57_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38886aaa2774717365c7bdccefaca320","title":"uk coronavirus live confusion a level grades england scotland covid 19 latest updates","story":"Last-minute inclusion of mock exam results in England follows U-turn over Scotland gradesBill Jacob’s, the local democracy reporter at the Lancashire , reports that a bar is being investigated over a social media video apparently showing large numbers of customers partying in its outdoor courtyard without regard to social distancing.The footage shows a crowd of people hugging, dancing closely together, chanting and singing in and around a tented area behind Harvey’s Bar on Cow Lane, Burnley.Now the borough council’s licensing department and police are investigating the video and whether any action needs to be taken for breach of strict coronavirus restrictions on people from more than one household gathering in force in the town.Burnley was included in strict new coronavirus restrictions on gatherings in East Lancashire following a spike in cases across the region on 30 July. While under the tight new rules, the government says people can meet in public outdoor spaces in groups of no more than six people from two households, and that social distancing should be observed at all times with people you do not live with.A Burnley Council spokesman told the paper: “We’re aware of the claims being made via social media and are working with partners to investigate further and identify any appropriate action.”Something to cheer you up: the Church of England’s longest serving priest has played an important role in his granddaughter’s wedding despite the coronavirus lockdown.The Rev Jim Cocke, 94, was the priest for the same parish in Oxford for 63 years until he retired in January and moved to a residential care home in Dorset.He had been due to give the address at the marriage ceremony of his granddaughter Lucy in April.But like many other weddings across the country the happy occasion had to be postponed because of Covid-19.When the service eventually went ahead on 18 July under physical distancing restrictions, only 15 people were allowed in the church and Cocke could not attend in person.Instead, staff at Colten Care’s Castle View care home in Poundbury ensured he was able to take part.After the ceremony, Castle View staff facilitated and hosted a Covid-safe visit which meant that Cocke could see the newlyweds face-to-face in their wedding attire.Cocke, who began his ministry in 1952 and became vicar of All Saints’ in Headington in 1957, said: “I felt very much included in the special day.

The health board’s data confirms that the cluster centres around younger people who are believed to have caught Covid-19 from a small number of bars, which reopened in Aberdeen over the last few weeks.The majority of those infected with Covid have either no symptoms ore relatively mild viral illnesses. We’re pleased no-one has been hospitalised.The major concern during an outbreak was that serious cases rose and led to wider community transmission. There was no evidence of wider community transmission in this Aberdeen cluster, he said.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, told the Scottish parliament on Wednesday the partial lockdown imposed on Aberdeen last week, which included the closure of all bars and restaurants in the city, would be extended for at least seven days.NHS Grampian said on Wednesday the latest total for the Aberdeen bars cluster was 177, up by 15 overnight. In addition, 940 close contacts had been identified, although that figure could include people identified multiple times, who were part of a family or other group.The Aberdeen data mirror evidence from other UK cities, including Trafford, Manchester, where many infections in a cluster in July were aged 25 or below, and then latterly aged 26 to 64.Another five people who tested positive for coronavirus in Wales have died, bringing the total number of deaths since the beginning of the pandemic to 1,586. Public Health Wales said the total number of cases in the country increased by eight, bringing the revised total of confirmed cases to 17,484.It may become necessary to relax the university numbers cap, according to the former Ucas chief executive, Mary Curnock Cook. She has told BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme:The problem for universities – leaving aside the kind of operational mess and everything being late – the problem for universities is that there’s been a number cap applied to students because early in the crisis everyone thought that demand for university would be down, whereas now all the indications are that aggregate demand for higher education will be up.The problem is that it sounds as if a lot of students won’t have their appeal grades confirmed for a number of weeks and that, of course, makes life very difficult for them, which is why I think it may be a good idea to relax this cap because if a university is up against the cap on recruitment then they’re going to have to make some very difficult decisions about potentially taking students who have got slightly lower grades, or waiting and hoping that the appeals come through.When Clare Marchant, the chief executive of Ucas, said blandly that sixth-formers issued with A-level results should “move on” and take university places that are available, she overlooked a brutal truth – that education and social mobility are inextricably linked.School isn’t just about memorising Shakespeare sonnets and the periodic table. For many of us, it’s about using talent, creativity and graft to ensure you don’t end up in the same place you started. To have the opportunities your parents never had and to end up in the same room as the people you once read about.To have your fate determined by factors outside of your control, such as the unconscious bias of teachers and your school’s league table performance, is not only unfair – it’s also deeply damaging.Ibuprofen does not increase risk of death from Covid-19, a study suggests.Early on in the pandemic, there was controversy over the use of ibuprofen after a French health minister advised against it.Scientists in the UK launched a review to assess ties to the drug and Covid-19. The Commission on Human Medicines’ expert working group concluded: “There is currently insufficient evidence to establish a link between use of ibuprofen and susceptibility to contracting Covid-19 or the worsening of its symptoms.”But a new study, which examined data from eight British hospitals at the height of the pandemic, found that the regular use of painkillers including ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac did not increase the risk of death from the disease.Their study, published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine, examined information on 1,200 patients and found no clear evidence that routine use of non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was associated with higher Covid-19 mortality.Researchers from the University of Aberdeen, Cardiff University and King’s College London found the death rate was similar compared to those who took NSAIDS and those who did not.Separate research is going on to determine whether the ibuprofen may actually prevent severe breathing problems associated with Covid-19. It is hoped a special formulation of the cheap anti-inflammatory drug, to be delivered at a certain point in illness among hospital patients, will reduce severe respiratory illness. A Highland community council is providing “toilet trowels” in up to 100 lay-bys across the north of Scotland as a last resort for tourists who have been caught out by the continued closure of public toilets.Lochbroom community council, which covers a chunk of the north-west around Ullapool, will also install signs directing visitors to where there are open public facilities and advice from Mountaineering Scotland on considerate camping behaviour, alongside making the trowels available for people to bury their own waste if they are in desperate straits.Communities across the Highlands have reported concerns about hygiene and littering following an influx of tourists since the easing of lockdown restrictions.Lockdown measures put in place in Aberdeen last week will remain, Sturgeon has said.The Scottish first minister said last week that the restrictions would be imposed to try to contain a local outbreak. Bars and restaurants were closed, as well as the return of the five-mile travel limit from homes.Sturgeon said there had now been 177 confirmed cases linked to the outbreak in Aberdeen, while 940 contacts had been identified. There had been no deaths in Scotland in the last 24 hours, she added. The first minister thanked the people in Aberdeen, after she said police had reported a high level of compliance with the additional lockdown measures.I know people in Aberdeen, who of course are today dealing with severe weather as well as Covid, will be disappointed with this decision, but I want to thank them for complying so well with the measures that we put in place last week.She also said that there was not yet a need to place extra restrictions on the county of Aberdeenshire as a whole.I want to stress that nobody wants these restrictions to be in place for longer than is necessary. They will be reviewed in one week’s time and as soon as we can relax any of them, then we will do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b487f6298ae93d44202b825f8a670866569fed/0_126_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f518095e322503bde96d36abf69c4f3b","title":"four young artists reveal how they express their unique voice in pictures","story":"As part of  Labs’ collaboration with Levi’s and young people with something to say, Gen Z illustrators and photographers discuss what informs their work‘We need a more erse understanding of the world’“I use my art to celebrate the lips, noses, hair and skin colour of women from black and mixed-race communities who have become stigmatised and criticised by society,” says illustrator Vicki Jones. “I believe everyone is beautiful and worthy of greater acceptance. I want other black and mixed-race people to see someone who looks like them, and for our white allies to see people who aren’t like them. It gives us all a more erse understanding of how the world is.”‘We have to question body image issues’“I had a problematic relationship with food and body image, and so did most of my friends,” says photographer Fanny Beckman. “Did you know that more lives are lost to eating disorders than any other mental health condition? Women of My Generation is a multimedia project which combines photography and a podcast to question beauty standards, and dismantle our body image issues. I want to prove that it is, beyond doubt, possible to feel confident regardless of body size, sexuality, ethnicity or socioeconomic background.”‘Look closer, and a new level opens up’“My illustration style is lowbrow, cartoony, so it might not strike you that there’s meaning beyond the skateboarding-style graphics,” says illustrator Chris Martin. “But I’m hoping to communicate bigger issues in my drawing. As with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there are unseen forces at work. Forces we don’t see straight away, but which create a deeper tension. There’s always another level to what we first think we see.”This is what confidence looks like“I use my voice to empower women and celebrate the ersity I see in my home city, London,” says photographer Milli Ahern. “I use bright saturated colours to project strength and confidence – a confidence that I didn’t feel myself, growing up. I was bullied about my appearance as a teenager. But that experience actually gave me strength as it led to me learning about photography, which allowed me to find my voice and highlight the beauty in ersity. Everyone needs to be seen and heard.”At the heart of the Your Voice. Your Way campaign is a zine, paid for by Levi’s, celebrating voices outside the mainstream. Created jointly by the four incredible artists showcased here and four talented writers, it proves the power of expressing yourself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8ef8771d704bcada862904664df8501847e82e/0_0_1335_801/master/1335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=227ac5f420b32dbae7c8172587057313","title":"a platform for the unheard the brand the zine and what it all means","story":"For the young creatives involved, deciding to apply to be part of a project to create a zine in collaboration with  Labs was easy. But why did Levi’s want to get involved?“Your Voice. Your Way is a celebration of imagination and identity,” says Yasmin Sinfield, brand marketing manager for Levi’s. But why does a brand best known for its denim care about amplifying unheard voices?“We believe we have a responsibility to support erse voices and make a stand against injustice – not just at this pivotal moment in history, but consistently,” she says.“As a brand Levi’s has a strong heritage of amplifying marginalised voices, and this zine has been in development for over a year. We’re committed to giving unheard voices a platform.”Levi’s, says Yasmin, has four core values: integrity, courage, empathy and originality. They serve as a reminder for the company to focus on what matters and to keep having important conversations. But what does that actually mean? And how does amplifying young voices contribute to those important conversations?“We’re doing our best to champion erse voices from the younger generation,” says Yasmin. This campaign wasn’t created to serve a financial purpose, but as a means to connect with, and rouse the voices of, this generation. Over the years, Levi’s has demonstrated its commitment to investing a portion of its annual earnings into communities. Take the Levi’s Music Project, for example, which connected global artists such as Alicia Keys and Skepta to young people to help them “champion their voice through music”.Levi’s also helped young LGBTQ+ photographers raise their voices, partnering with LGBTQ+ museum Queer Britain in celebration of Pride 2019 in the UK. The collaboration kicked off with a curated photography exhibition in London’s Covent Garden called Chosen Family. Levi’s truly believes that this zine is vital and authentic. From the company’s beginnings in 1853, it set out to enable people to express their iniduality. Now, Levi’s wants to work with us to empower our generation.Being courageous is about far more than building your own confidence. By raising your voice, you could inspire countless others. In this zine, Levi’s provides a platform for young voices because, says Yasmin: “Small changes spun together can create something much bigger that makes a real difference.”This zine isn’t the first Your Voice. Your Way project. Last year, the focus was on musicians from the Levi’s Music Project who had all faced barriers to achieving their dreams, but had transformed their lives by having courage in their own convictions.Musicians can make themselves heard when they perform, but there are so many people who don’t have a platform. “In a world where it seems like everyone’s talking over each other, it can be hard for young people to use their voices in their own way, because they don’t know where or how to do so,” says Yasmin.Levi’s thinks brands can provide a place to start, to platform emerging creatives and commit to listening to young voices. The partnership between Levi’s and  Labs has enabled us to set up and support a network of talented young creatives, bringing us together with mentors who will continue to encourage us.If you invented blue jeans, you have a good idea of what it means to be original. Levi’s had a practical purpose: its jeans were first created in 1873 to satisfy a need from workers who needed durable trousers those jeans evolved into one of the world’s most iconic fashion items. Now, our needs are more nuanced than durable workwear. Levi’s hopes Your Voice. Your Way will provide a “blank canvas for self expression”.When they told us we could create this zine our way, they meant it. We’ve had support but, ultimately, we called the shots. By giving us the opportunity to choose what stories to cover, we’ve had real creative freedom. We took the challenge to share our inidualism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects.

I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think.

Photograph:  Stephen CollinsCollins PhotossA new plan for the country’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic will see health officials and the Government strive to get Ireland into a “status blue” period where the virus is suppressed, it has emerged.The Government intends to move away from the current “phased” approach to reopening society and the economy to a new plan that will see different colour-coded statuses depending on the levels of Covid-19 in any given area.The Cabinet committee on Covid-19 met on Tuesday and Ministers discussed the new nine-month plan which will detail how the country can safely live alongside the virus in the future.The approach taken in New Zealand to try and fully quash the virus will not be adopted here, sources say.Officials are keen to move towards a colour-coded plan consisting of red, orange, yellow and blue statuses.However, the blue status will only come into effect when vaccinations are available or there is some other kind of medical breakthrough that suppresses the coronavirus.‘Instinctive ’ system“It would be useful if this was seen by the public as something akin to a weather warning, that people instinctively knew what they can do depending on the colour. The reason green is not included in there is because green almost says that everything is okay and things can go on as normal, which for now is not the case,” a source said.It is also understood that health officials are against the idea of local lockdowns, believing a national and regional response to be sufficient. Different sectors of the economy will have to detail their plans for outbreaks and public health risk assessments will become vital in local areas under the new framework.Ministers also discussed economic measures for the three midlands counties that are in lockdown.The Government’s package of economic supports for the region will be designed in a way that allows it to be applied to other parts of the country which go into lockdown in the future, sources said. With further localised outbreaks of the disease likely, the aim is to draw up something which can be repeated again.Speeded-up access to schemes or prioritising applications from affected areas may be considered in order to support businesses in the three counties.Pub survivalMeanwhile, publicans met with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath on Tuesday to discuss a range of extra support measures for the industry. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Varadkar told The  the “Government appreciates that many pubs’ survival is being threatened due to a closure order that is going on for longer than any of them expected”. He said the Government wanted to ensure pubs “survive long enough to reopen when that’s possible”. Mr Varadkar also said the Government would examine giving greater powers to the Health and Safety Authority to inspect workplaces. This followed calls to close a legal loophole which means meat plants and other employers have no obligation to report transmission of Covid-19 to the HSA. Separately, it emerged on Tuesday night that all 210 workers at Carroll Cuisine in Tullamore, Co Offaly, who were tested for Covid-19 on Sunday have received negative results.The staff were tested by Health Service Executive public health specialists at the weekend after nine staff at the facility had contracted the disease.A spokesman said operations at the facility, which ceased on Monday, would remain suspended until after consultations had taken place with HSE staff.The factory is one of four large meat processing plants in the Midlands which have been hit by outbreaks of Covid-19.The results come as the latest figures show there has been one new Covid-19-related death and 35 new cases reported to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre. This is the lowest number of daily cases since July 29th. Acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn warned the daily number of new cases was likely to “rise and fall” this week. Also on Tuesday, it emerged that a ward at Naas General Hospital in Co Kildare has been closed due to a suspected Covid-19 outbreak, with a number of staff currently self-isolating as a result.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe .Imposing two weeks of movement restrictions in Laois, Offaly and Kildare in response to a spike in Covid-19 cases was not “a blunt instrument” to deal with the issue, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has said. Mr Donnelly said that if this sort of measure had not been introduced for a period it was “entirely possible” that similar restrictions would have had to be imposed elsewhere in the State again. He said restrictions had been put in place to save lives, to protect vulnerable people and the local economy. If the Government had not reacted as quickly as it did, the virus could have spread “around the country” and “we would have been right back at the beginning”. The Minister told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that it was important to move as quickly and as locally as possible in response to the increase in confirmed cases, many of which related to people working in the meat processing sector.More than 300 additional cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in Co Kildare in the past fortnight, according to figures provided by the Department of Health earlier this week. The 14-day incidence of Covid-19 in Co Kildare stood at 138.4 cases per 100,000 of population on Monday, almost eight times the national average. The rates in Laois and Offaly were also multiples of the national average. SpectacularThe response of the Irish people in the pandemic to date has been “nothing short of spectacular”. The data showed that despite the clusters, the level of community transmission in the State has been very low, he said.“We could be looking at this for nine months to two years before a vaccine comes through so we need to be fully transparent with people.”Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said the Government’s intention was to announce economic supports for the Midlands counties that are under the localised lockdown this week, perhaps as soon as Thursday. He said businesses have told him they want funding for marketing campaigns to offset some of the reputational damage that has been done, with many in the three counties feeling retail, travel and hospitality sectors will be hurt as people will be slow to return to the areas. “We’re going to help to counteract that, perhaps through marketing funds and other things,” he said. “As they pointed out to me, that if we can impose local restrictions surely we can have some additional local investment and financial support for business.”More frequentWorld Health Organisation (WHO) representative David Nabarro said that localised lockdowns are going to be more frequent in the future and the public is going to have to learn to live with the constant threat of the virus.He told RTÉ radio’s Today with Sarah McInerney show that the question of how much of an area should be focused on to supress the spread of the virus would evolve over time. The authorities will go for a wider area at the beginning, but over time “as we get more sophisticated” the area will narrow, he said.The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) is to meet on Wednesday to review the latest trends on Covid-19. The meeting comes after 35 new cases were reported on Wednesday, the lowest number of daily cases in almost a fortnight.On the issue of localised lockdowns, Prof Mary Horgan, president of the Royal College of Physicians Ireland, said public health authorities would have to link in with businesses and the local community rather than “broad brush strokes” on a national or by county basis. She said the situation in the Midlands provides an opportunity to look at all the information gathered over the 14 days of restrictions, which will have “huge implications” for the people of the three counties.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Investigation \u0026lsquoable to withstand most robust and forensic examination by defence in this case\u0026rsquoFamily speak of sadness and relief after body of James Patterson discovered last monthGovernment intends to move away from the current \u0026lsquophased\u0026rsquo approach to reopening to a new planVaradkar indicates support package for sector, as demanded by vintners, being preparedCo Armagh man (29) faces mandatory 40 year prison term over 2013 death in Co LouthFamily man was the 87th member of the force to be killed on dutyVaradkar expects funding for businesses in Kildare, Laois and Offaly to be announced soonWarm weather on Wednesday will be followed by unsettled and humid conditionsScientists say the creature was 4m long, and related to the Tyrannosaurus rex\u0026lsquoIt is hard to understand why we are not using the capacity that is there for wider testing\u0026rsquoNearly half of parents will consider Covid-19 measures put in place before allowing children return to schoolRoyal Hospital Donnybrook says works to fix \u0026lsquodeficient systems\u0026rsquo will cost \u0026euro2.3mMinister urges employers to consider the \u0026lsquowin-win\u0026rsquo incentive schemeTesting extended to meat plant workers and asylum seekersEmployers not obliged to report diseases to the Health and Safety AuthorityLabels akin to weather warnings will apply to different regions with \u0026lsquoblue\u0026rsquo as virus-free goalDepartment of Justice estimates \u0026euro44m shortfall in funding for Garda payroll costsGroups looking into different approach to fevers and swabs to stop people avoiding testsFour neonatal units do not have adequate isolation facilities, according to reportStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4328262.1597219322!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sunny spells forecast with high temperatures of 26 degrees","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPortmarnock Beach, Co Dublin: Met Éireann has forecast high temperatures for Wednesday.

A new £650 million Brexit support and peace and reconciliation package for Northern Ireland was announced by British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove who was visiting the North on Friday.The funding comprises £300 million of support for the European Union’s Peace Plus programme and £355 million to assist traders in the North deal with the complications of Brexit. Of the £355 million the package involves £200 million towards a new free-to-use Trader Support Service that will assist with import, safety and security declarations on behalf of traders.The other £155 million, according to Mr Gove’s office, will fund the development of new technology to ensure the new processes can be fully digital and streamlined.Mr Gove’s department said the “new service will be available to businesses bringing in goods from Great Britain or the rest of the world, providing guidance as well as dealing with their requirements for moving goods into Northern Ireland”. The £300 million confirmed by Mr Gove for the Peace Plus programme will help “to support peace, prosperity and reconciliation projects on the island of Ireland”.Mr Gove who, accompanied by Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis, was visiting Northern Ireland on Friday, said the £650 million investment underlined the British government’s “absolute commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland as we move towards the end of the transition period”.“Our new free-to-use Trader Support Service will provide vital support and guidance to traders, while our £300 million investment in reconciliation projects will help to preserve the huge gains from the peace process and the Belfast Agreement,” he said. “As we continue to engage with businesses, and our discussions with the EU proceed, we will update these resources to ensure that traders are ready for the end of the transition period,” added Mr Gove.Mr Lewis said the Trader Support Service “will ensure that businesses of all sizes can have import processes dealt with on their behalf, at no cost”."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationNorth Korea subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over nuclear and ballistic missile programsAt least 29 killed in terror group\u0026rsquos assault on prison in eastern city of JalalabadPolice officers and government officials suspended following deaths in Punjab stateStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4328226.1597210437!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new zealand considers freight as possible source of new covid 19 cluster","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern speaks to media during a press conference at parliament on Wednesday in Wellington after Covid-19 restrictions were reintroduced across the country after four new cases were diagnosed in Auckland. Photograph:  Hagen HopkinsGetty Images.New Zealand officials are investigating the possibility that its first Covid-19 cases in more than three months were imported by freight, as the country plunged back into lockdown on Wednesday.The discovery of four infected family members in Auckland led prime minister Jacinda Ardern to swiftly reimpose tight restrictions on movement in the country’s biggest city and travel limitations across the entire country.The source of the outbreak has baffled health officials, who said they were confident there were no local transmission of the virus in New Zealand for 102 days and that the family had not travelled overseas.“We are working hard to put together pieces of the puzzle on how this family got infected,” said director general of health Ashley Bloomfield.Investigations were zeroing in on the potential the virus was imported by freight. Dr Bloomfield said surface testing was underway at an Auckland cool store where a man from the infected family worked.“We know the virus can survive within refrigerated environments for quite some time,” he said during a televised media conference.The NZ business of Atlanta, US-based, Americold, a refrigerated storage specialist with operations in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, identified itself as the owner of the cool store.Americold NZ managing director Richard Winnall told the NZ Herald the infected man had been on sick leave for several days and all employees had been sent home for tests.PackagingChina has reported instances of the coronavirus being detected on the packaging of imported frozen seafood.The World Health Organisation website states there is currently no confirmed case of Covid-19 transmitted through food or food packaging. However, it also notes that studies have shown that the virus can survive for up to 72 hours on plastic.Residents of Auckland, home to around 1.7 million people, were given just hours to prepare for the return to level 3 restrictions on Wednesday, requiring people to stay at home unless for essential trips.“Going hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,” Ms Ardern said. “Our response to the virus so far has worked ... we know how to beat this.”The rest of the country was placed back into slightly looser level 2 restrictions. The restrictions will initially remain in place until Friday.Police set up roadblocks around Auckland to discourage a mass exodus from the city, while supermarkets began rationing the sale of some staple products amid a rush to the shelves. Long queues formed at Covid-19 testing centres in the city.Ms Ardern said her cabinet will decide on Friday on the next steps with regards to restrictions.Two members of the infected family had visited tourist sites in the town of Rotorua, about three hours drive south of Auckland, while symptomatic, and a third had gone to work at a finance company in Auckland, also while symptomatic.Dr Bloomfield said four people who had contact with the family were considered likely cases. More than 200 people have been identified as close or casual contacts of the family and health officials were prepared to test tens of thousands of people in the coming days, he added.Possible election delayMs Ardern also delayed a key step toward a September 19th general election, suspending the dissolution of parliament, that usually kicks off campaigning, until Monday.A decision on whether the actual poll would be delayed would be announced before Monday, Ms Ardern said, as the country’s major opposition party cancelled its weekend campaign launch and called for the election to be pushed back to November.National Party leader Judith Collins also demanded more transparency around the outbreak and the decision to resume lockdown measures, citing the scale of the economic impact.In a scheduled announcement that coincided with the return to lockdown, the central bank surprised markets by expanding its bond buying programme and held out the prospect of negative interest rates in a bid to revive the virus-battered economy.“Given the ongoing health uncertainty, there remains a downside risk to our baseline economic scenario,” the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said. - ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Names of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersTwenty-five years after the Balkan conflict\u0026rsquos worst atrocity the Bosnian town remains idedDemonstrations stretch far beyond prime minister\u0026rsquos official residence in Jerusalem\u0026lsquoWe have no trust in our government . . .

He agreed to negotiations with Athens but then pulled back, angered at Greece\u0027s decision to  secretly sign a maritime deal with Egypt last week, limiting Ankara’s influence in the oil-and-mineral rich region even further.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"kamala harris smart pick vp","story":"Kamala Harris was the smart pick as Joe Biden’s running mate, and I’m sure he agreed when his team explained why. Over the summer, as the cities went up in smoke and Biden pulled ahead in the polls, Donald Trump fell back on the “silent majority”.The Democrats were captivated by arson, activism and identity politics, or fawning before the visibly senescent “Sleepy Joe”. Trump, his supporters explained, would sweep the overlooked, commonsensical moderate voters in November’s elections. But that was before Harris entered the race to the White House.First detected and cultivated by Richard Nixon in 1968, the “silent majority” was hunted to near-extinction in the Reagan and Clinton years. This psephological species is reclusive, but it breeds well in the captivity of the suburbs and the small towns. Like its transatlantic cousin, the shy Tory, the silent majority camouflages its vote for polarising candidates by lying to pollsters in both phone polls and exit polls.   The Democratic machine is already trading on the trivia of tokenism for years, it has been programmed to emit nothing but confections of ethnic and racial affiliation. Although Harris has previously identified only as African American, new hyphenations of her identity are now being hyped to voters sensitive to niche variations on the familiar symbolism: the first Indian American on a presidential ticket, as well as the first Asian American and the first black woman.Yet little in Harris’s record suggests sensitivity towards any of these identity groups, or advocacy on their behalf. Much in her record as district attorney in California suggests a belligerent insensitivity to racial issues.The Democratic Left, which you’d think would be in a frenzy of ethno-racial-sexual piety about Harris’s breaking of yet more glass ceilings, despises her on both counts. They even mock her as a cop for her ambitious and at times have criticised her for her unethical pursuit of convictions when she was district attorney in California. But the Democratic Left has no one else to vote for.Meanwhile in the real world, a vice-presidential nominee with a strong record in what Trump tweets as “LAW AND ORDER” is a serious contender. And the symbolism of Harris’s skin will do her no harm either.Americans are sick of identity politics and racial politics, but Americans seem unable to imagine their politics in any other terms. Americans are violent and lawless, but Americans are terrified of violence and lawlessness. Even before the Covid-19 epidemic and the demonstrations and riots, the desire for a return to normal was one of the few bipartisan sentiments among the voters.Harris symbolises that desire to escape the demented reality of modern America, and return to the American normal. This is to have your cake and eat it: to pursue one policy while voting for the symbols of another.With Harris, suburban centrists can vote for law and order without the collateral risks of voting for Trump: the social stigma, the taint of racism, the sheer embarrassment, the demonstrable abnormality of the collapse of the partition between the dreamland of reality television and what used to be the orderly technocracy of government.Harris is as close to normal as politics can get. Barack Obama\u0027s background was genuinely exotic for a politician. He passed part of his childhood outside the US, and he spent his youth in Hawaii, which is hardly America at all. Harris, the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, is consummately Californian, proof that America still makes Americans.Hillary Clinton carried a whiff of insider-dealing, which is one kind of sophistication, and Beltway arrogance, which is another. So far, none of the muck through which Harris has waded has stuck to her: the entry into politics via her then-boyfriend, San Francisco’s mayor Willie Brown the overturned convictions in California the unfortunate episode in which she withheld exculpatory evidence about a convict on death row the zigzagging in the primaries between cynical race-politicking and Obamanite kumbaya.The Republicans will attack her on all this, but it may well backfire. Nothing in Harris’s public record is as lurid as Donald Trump’s private past. Nothing she can say is as erratic as his Twitter feed. The more the Republicans claim she is an extremist, a panderer to the anti-American crusade of the woke Left, the more her measured manner and warm-toned pantsuits will deflect that charge back on Trump, the master of misrule.It might not reflect too well on Harris’s senior partner, either. On Tuesday, Biden’s handlers released a photo of Harris and Biden exchanging what the cool kids call a high-five. Biden looks like a waxwork, and Harris like she is pulling her punch in case she knocks off his hand. Another photograph shows Biden making a Zoom call to Harris on Tuesday afternoon. Biden, to keep it spontaneous, is reading from a script. This suggests that his own team don’t trust him to stay on-message.Biden seems to be unable to remember his lines. Trump is the great extemporiser. Mike Pence, Trump’s impressively passive vice-president, couldn’t quip his way out of a paper bag. Harris is a cool performer. She won’t forget the script.If Biden fails to talk his way past Trump this time, Harris may still swing it for him – and for herself. This nomination makes Harris the default Democratic nominee for 2024. Given that Biden doesn’t look like he has the stamina to see out a four-year term, she might be president even sooner.Dominic Green is Life \u0026amp Arts editor of The Spectator USA.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"met deputy commissioner condemns trial social media following","story":"The police must be allowed to carry out their job without being subjected to “trial by social media”, one of Scotland Yard’s most senior officers has said, as he defended officers who stopped a black politician as she was driving through London.Dawn Butler, the Labour MP for Brent Central, accused the politan Police of institutional racism, after a car she was travelling in was pulled over in east London on Sunday.Ms Butler filmed the exchange and uploaded the footage to social media, prompting a fierce debate over the policing of the black community in Britain.But Deputy Commissioner Sir Steve House said subjecting officers to “trial by social media” was making it difficult for them to do their job of keeping people safe.Mr House said the officers had not been aware of the colour or ethnicity of the occupants of the vehicle because it had tinted window and he insisted they had acted in an entirely professional and polite way.In a statement, Mr House said: “The officers who undertook the stop were from the Violent Crime Task Force and were in the area as part of our proactive work to protect communities from violence.“Criminals often use vehicles to travel in and to commit crime, therefore officers will often check cars to see if there is anything that requires them to stop it and do further checks. “The officers ran a number plate check on the vehicle. At this stage, the officers still didn’t know who the occupants of the car were, including their ethnicity because the car windows were tinted.“As a result of an officer making a human error as he inputted the car registration, the Police National Computer returned details of a car from another part of the UK.“The officers were not initially aware of this problem and as a result felt, with good reason, that they should do further checks on the car by stopping it and engaging with the occupants. I expect officers to have professional curiosity and I would have done the same.“I have viewed all the available video material of that interaction and I have read their statements - the officers acted professionally and politely, explaining why the stop was made and, when realising there was a mistake, explaining this and continuing to answer the occupants’ questions. “Ms Butler has said that she has no complaint about \u0027how\u0027 the stop was conducted, rather her concerns lie in why the stop was initiated and I have discussed these concerns with her. “The officers in this case came into work on Sunday to keep Londoners safe.“Officers expect to be scrutinised and there are existing, appropriate and proportionate processes for making complaints and for facts to be established, and on the occasions where there is fault - unlike this case - for consequences to follow.The increasingly routine trial by social media is unfair and damaging to inidual officers and has the potential to undermine the role our communities need us to do to protect them and keep them safe from violence.“I am grateful to these officers, as I am to all our officers who act professionally, humanely and in the service of the public.“I would also like to condemn the abuse that some on social media have directed at Ms Butler. It is unwarranted and unacceptable and we are working to support her.”Earlier this week, Ken Marsh, the chairman of the politan Police Federation, said it was getting to the stage that officers were going to stop doing their jobs because of the fear of the recriminations.The incident also comes weeks after the Team GB sprinter, Bianca Williams, complained after she and her boyfriend were stopped by police in west London.Dame Cressida Dick, the Met Commissioner, subsequently apologised for any distress caused to the athlete and the matter has been referred to the police watchdog.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"moment kamala harris turned joe biden sealed us vice presidential","story":"Fourteen months on, it remains the most electrifying moment thus far in the long race to become President of the United States come November: when Kamala Harris wrong-footed Joe Biden over race, specifically over his opposition to busing, a controversial policy aimed at giving black and ethnic minority children the chance to attend better schools in predominantly white areas.A highly personal, calculated moment, it got her noticed. Suddenly, everyone in political circles was talking about Harris, California senator and clearly a wily operator.  The cut-though then brought her to last night\u0027s announcement, when she became the first woman of colour to be adopted as a vice-presidential candidate.It also marked the start of an apparently unstoppable precipitous slide for Biden, before somehow he mounted the most astonishing comeback. No wonder, then, that the video clip top-ranked on Google searches for days.Back last June, Harris, the daughter of a Jamaican economist and an Indian-born cancer researcher, was itching to get at Biden, a long-standing family friend through his son, Beau, whose death from a brain tumour at 46 in 2015 had shattered Biden. He was, of course, no stranger to tragedy: his wife and daughter had died in car crash more than 30 years earlier. What could prove her credentials more than to surprise and criticise some she knew so well?  There were 10 wanna-be presidents on the stage in Miami on June 27 last year. Indeed, so many Democrats fancied their chances of a tilt at the White House that they had to run the first debate of the candidates over two nights, with another ten clashing the previous evening. Biden was then the perceived front-runner, but his lead was fragile, and what Harris did could well have buried him.As Harris, pained expression set on her face, turned to her right, only Bernie Sanders, who had pushed Hillary Clinton so close for the nomination last time round, stood between the senator and her target, the former US vice-president. Sanders seemed to sense what was coming, and, imperceptibly, took a step back out of the firing line to allow her a better shot.Biden had been in trouble in liberal circles for more than a week. He had tried to make a point at a fund-raiser at the Carlyle Hotel in New York about the increasing polarisation of politics. But, as it sometimes does with him, especially on race issues, he missed the mark.  He said that, early on in his long career, he had served with senators James O Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia, both Democrats who were staunch opponents of desegregation. Eastland was to give the young Delaware Senator a leg-up. Talmadge, Biden told his audience, was “one of the meanest guys I ever knew”.“Well guess what?” Biden continued. “At least there was some civility. We got things done. We didn’t agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished. But today you look at the other side and you’re the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don’t talk to each other anymore.” While Biden’s liberal credentials were always strong, he had been an opponent of busing, at least as ordered by the Department of Education. As black kids were taken in one direction to the good schools, the policy meant white children went the other way, to under-performing often inner-city establishments. White parents were often furiously opposed. Biden preferred other ways of tackling the problem. Harris, an outside bet at the time, but one who had realistic hopes she could build momentum, was waiting to pounce.  And, one hour in, as Sanders backed out of range, she did, turning the debate to race, and, specifically, to Mr Biden.She said: “Growing up, my sister and I had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents couldn’t play with us because because we were black. “And I will say also that — that, in this campaign, we have also heard — and I’m going to now direct this at Vice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist, and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground.“But I also believe, and it’s personal, and it was actually very hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing.And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. “And that little girl was me.”Public prosecutor Harris delivered her lines - especially the punchline - with aplomb, more in sorrow than the coolly controlled anger she also let viewers glimpse, and Biden, who sometimes does get caught on the hop, looked stunned. He was to confess to others later he was upset even that he felt betrayed. There were incidental debates afterwards about whether the pair were that far apart on busing. Biden said he did not oppose local authorities making such decisions, and pointed out that was what had happened with Harris. He rejected her inference - that he would have prevented her from benefitting.

Harris explained her approach in the debate simply. “It was politics,” she is reported to have said.

This is freaking HALO! You don’t come out half cocked with a gun this big.”Many people shared the famous quote from Nintendo mastermind Shigeru Miyamoto, wherein he said that a “delayed game is eventually good”, whereas “a rushed game is forever bad”.However, many others also bemoaned the delay, and noted Xbox’s lack of first-party properties to encourage sales when the new console launches.With Sony’s own next-generation console, the PS5, arriving around the end of the year too, some people are speculating that the superior line-up of exclusive games, including Spider-man: Miles Morales, would leave the Series X some way behind, in terms of sales.“No Halo Infinite this holiday season,” wrote one commentor. “Spider-man and PS5 will dominate.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Leading health experts from around the world have continued to raise doubts about Russia\u0027s claim that it has developed a vaccine for the coronavirus.Following Vladimir Putin\u0027s claim on Tuesday that Russia had approved the world\u0027s first Covid-19 vaccine after less than two months of testing, Dr Anthony Fauci, America\u0027s leading infectious disease expert, expressed serious doubt about the validity of the vaccine trial. I hope that the Russians have actually, definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective. I seriously doubt that they\u0027ve done that,” Dr Fauci said in a panel discussion with National Geographic.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGermany\u0027s health minister Jens Spahn also said on Wednesday that he was very sceptical about what\u0027s going on in Russia.“I would be pleased if we had an initial, good vaccine but based on everything we know - and that\u0027s the fundamental problem, namely that the Russians aren\u0027t telling us much - this has not been sufficiently tested,” he added.Are politics trumping science in the race for a coronavirus vaccine?Also expressing concerns about the validity of the trial was former chief of the US Food and Drug Administration Scott Gottlieb, who said: It appears that it’s only been tested in several hundred patients at most.“I wouldn’t take it, certainly not outside a clinical trial right now.”Russia has not made any further information about the vaccine public, leading experts to question why it has not followed the precedent for transparency set by other countries trialling vaccines.The results of Oxford University\u0027s vaccine trial were published in The Lancet medical journal, for example, and mid-stage data from China\u0027s SinoVac trial were released on Monday.Danny Altman, professor of Immunology at Imperial College London, said: “While information on the vast majority of the vaccines and trial protocols in the world have been made available, there seems to be rather little detail thus far on the Russian candidates.Duterte offers to be \u0027injected in public\u0027 with Russian Covid vaccineNew Zealand says imported freight could be source of new outbreakThe coronavirus vaccine shows the UK can be productiveNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Kazakhstan has said it will send officials to Moscow later this month to discuss possible deliveries of the drug.Meanwhile, Brazil\u0027s Parana state is in talks with Russia to produce the vaccine and Philippine scientists were set to meet representatives of the research facility that developed the vaccine on Wednesday to discuss possible participation in clinical trials and access to its research data.Additional reporting by ReutersShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Other cast members would include Stanley’s nephew, who is a widower with two small children.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week (11 August), Baker revealed that he had been targeted by a racist Instagram account in the wake of the Kickstarter campaign.

Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Researchers have questioned the effectiveness of the government using behavioural science techniques to “nudge” the public into changes during the coronavirus outbreak.Scientists from King’s College London found that, when used in the context of the pandemic, nudges previously shown to encourage people to act in desired ways did not have the expected effects.The Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) – known as the “nudge unit” – has helped develop strategy for dealing with the pandemic at the Cabinet Office.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDr Michael Sanders, reader in public policy at the Policy Institute, King’s College London, said it was “no surprise” governments have turned to behavioural scientists for insights since “controlling the spread of the coronavirus pandemic is as much about human behaviour”.Urging caution, he added: “Across two papers and six studies, our new findings cast doubt on the actual impacts of some of the most commonly used tools in the context of this crisis.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyIn the first study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Economic Letters, researchers tested so-called “loss aversion” messages – the idea that people value losses more than they do gains of equivalent size.A group of 500 people were randomly assigned to be shown one of two messages, presented as government information posters. Contrary to loss aversion theory, the researchers found highlighting potential lives lost did not make people more cautious about ending lockdown measures.They said this may be because the participants were already familiar with the large death toll for Covid-19, with and without lockdown measures.In a second study, currently under peer review, the researchers carried out a series of experiments testing a different set of nudges in April, May and June.Inside the UK government’s influential behavioural ‘nudge unit’According to the research, while nudges increased respondents’ intention to comply with a series of health guidelines to tackle Covid-19, they did not have the expected result of actually changing their behaviour.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Experts have criticised an apparent guess made by No 10’s closest advisers in the early weeks of March that the public would not stick with lockdown rules for a long period of time.On 9 March, chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said: “There is a risk if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued and it will be difficult to sustain this over time.”Professor Robert West, member of the government’s Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), has denied the idea of “lockdown fatigue” came from his group.Officials at the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) – the so-called “nudge unit” – have also denied the idea of “fatigue” came from them.A BIT spokesperson said the team had “categorically never proposed or suggested behavioural fatigue with respect to Covid-19”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In Minsk, which saw the worst violence, water cannon, stun grenades and rounds of rubber bullets were deployed against protesters. In two instances, a police van drove into crowds. At least four people ended up in intensive care, with one man reportedly in critical condition. In other cities across the country, officers reportedly laid down arms and crossed to the side of protesters. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe unity opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who claimed victory in the face of the scarcely credible 9.9 per cent assigned to her by the official preliminary results, called on police and army officers to stop the violence. “I want to ask them to remember that they are part of the nation too,” she said. Hours before voting ended, Belarus had all but declared a state of emergency. Footage of soldiers and military equipment entering the capital was widely shared by locals.By 6pm local time (3pm GMT), most of the capital’s central squares and government buildings had been cordoned off. Transport systems were shut down. Roads in and out of the capital were also closed. The regime’s obvious nervousness extended to widespread efforts to control the internet. Major disruptions to mobile networks were reported from the morning, with connections practically grinding to a halt at around 10pm local time. Proxy servers, used widely in these parts to get around censorship, became unreliable.Belarus’s upcoming election spells out two very different futuresUnidentified forces want ‘massacre’ in Belarus, says LukashenkoBelarus charges opposition politicians with assisting Russian plotJournalists and other independent observers appeared to be a target. At around 2pm local time, three reporters from the Russian liberal outlet TV Dozhd were handcuffed, held to the ground, and arrested. Just before midnight, AP photographer Mstyslav Chernov was admitted to hospital with suspected concussion after being beaten by riot police while in their custody. Sunday’s events came at the end of an unexpectedly panicked campaign for Belarus’s longtime leader – one that saw opposition candidates jailed, protesters snatched from the streets, the president claim a scarcely believable Russian-backed plot, and where the opposition candidate was forced into hiding on the eve of voting.Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, 37, was never supposed to mount a serious challenge, only entering the race after President Lukashenko jailed her husband, and presidential hopeful, Sergei Tikhanovsky. Famously dismissive of women in politics, Mr Lukashenko seemed to believe the housewife and former translator didn’t have a chance.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBut her invigorating, earnest campaign surprised Belarus and it wrong-footed Mr Lukashenko. Few expected Ms Tikhanovskaya to reach an agreement with the campaign teams of other banned opposition candidates – but she managed to do so in just 15 minutes. Few believed she could lead a clear campaign – but she did so with simple promises to deliver fresh elections, walk back authoritarian changes to the constitution, and free political prisoners.Flanked by Veronika Tsepkalo, the wife of Valery Tsepkalo, another barred candidate, and Maria Kolesnikova, campaign manager for jailed Viktor Barbariko, Ms Tikhanovskaya’s opposition campaign took on unmistakably feminist, modern slant. It also brought over 200,000 people to the streets in support – an astonishing achievement in Belarus, a police state of just 9 million people, and where dissent often leads to jail.Underestimating Ms Tikhanovskaya was not the only mistake the usually clever and adroit Mr Lukashenko made in the run-up to the elections. His electoral rating was hit hard by a perceived cavalier approach to the Covid-19 epidemic: he claimed the virus was avoidable with vodka, trips to the sauna and work in the potato fields. His management of the country’s increasingly desperate economic position – and its rapidly unwinding model of Soviet planning with Russian subsidies – also provoked much anger. The extraordinary campaign to unseat Belarusian ‘dictator’ LukashenkoGiven the fact independent polling is illegal in Belarus, it was never entirely clear quite how vulnerable “Europe’s last dictator” actually became to Ms Tikhanovskaya’s challenge. But results from a handful of more reliable Minsk polling stations appeared to support the opposition claim that Ms Tikhanovskaya had, in fact, won — and convincingly.Unprecedented numbers of voters appeared to answer Ms Tikhanovskaya’s call to turn out late on Sunday — and the logic this would make falsifications more difficult. But Lidia Yermoshina, a key Lukashenko ally and chief vote counter as the head of Belarus\u0027s election committee, described the huge queues as “provocations” by the opposition. In an earlier interview on state TV, she described the opposition as a “totalitarian sect”.Independent exit polls conducted outside polling stations in foreign embassies also painted a starkly contrasting picture to the official figures. According to these surveys, Mr Lukashenko received just 6.25 per cent, compared to Ms Tikhanovskaya with 79.69 per cent. Ahead of the end of voting, Mr Lukashenko dismissed his rivals as being “unworthy of repression”. But he also seemed to make ominous warnings for those intending to protest. “All our structures and special services are ready and waiting,” he said. “There is no reason for our country to be plunged into chaos or civil war. I guarantee you that.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a particularly cold June morning in northern Kenya when rangers working in Loisaba Nature Conservancy first spotted a large male elephant limping near a watering hole. The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular. The Independent\u0027s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals.Funds raised will to pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animals.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHowever the impact of Covid-19 means help is urgently needed to protect elephants against an increased threat of slaughter.In 2015 Space for Giants worked with international conservation organisation The Nature Conservancy to establish Loisaba as a conservation trust in perpetuity, protecting a critical habitat for a ersity of endangered species.Covering an area of 57,000 acres in the county of Laikipia, Loisaba has an increasing resident population of elephants, estimated at around 800, as well as an abundance of other fauna, including more than 260 bird species and 57 mammals, such as lions, leopards and cheetahs.Space for Giants supports wildlife monitoring, security and conservancy management in Loisaba, financed by The Nature Conservancy and other donors, including San Diego Zoo. The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

But also because he was only  years old and had been married to his beautul we Lissie for just a month.It was heartbreaking to see the photos of the pair overflowing with love and happiness at their wedding — while knowing his le had been needlessly ended.Our hearts went out to Lissie, who no doubt is still trying to make sense of the tragedy. So too his mother and father. For any parent, such a loss is unthinkable. Nobody should have to bury their child.It is against the natural order of things, especially when your beloved son or daughter has been murdered.That kind of pain will never go away. It becomes the defining moment of a parent’s le.Who would blame someone in that position for opting out of le ­altogether and sinking into inertia and depression  To me, that even seems the most likely response.Instead, his mum Debbie Adlam has hit the campaign trail, arguing for longer sentences for anyone who kills a policeman.PC Harper’s killers were convicted of manslaughter but cleared of ­murder.Henry Long, , who drove the getaway car, was jailed for  years. His accomplices Albert ­Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , were each given  years.Unduly lenient sentences, to my mind — and probably yours too.On Wednesday, Lissie began a campaign to bring in “Andrew’s Law”, in memory of her late husband. She wants anyone who kills a police officer, firefighter, nurse, doctor or paramedic to be jailed for le — meaning a minimum of  years.Mrs Adlam, who has been robbed of growing old happily with her beloved son in her le, has joined the campaign.“We got to the end of our trial and we didn’t feel like justice had been done,” she said. “We felt like we had been punched.“We didn’t walk away feeling that we had done Andrew proud.”That is the nub of the matter. She wants to do right by her late son. And I imagine she will not rest until she feels she has done that.It is only when tragedy strikes that many people realise how strong and determined they can be.Nothing can bring back PC Harper. ButAndrew’s Law comes to pass, acting as a deterrent to other criminals, at least one positive will have come from an otherwise senseless death.The need for justice is a stronger force than most of us can comprehend. I think of Stephen Lawrence’s mother Doreen, whose le changed overnight when her son was ­murdered in a racist attack in .She campaigned tirelessly for reforms to the police service and founded the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust.She forged positive change from the tragic murder of her son, ­showing the strength of her feeling and the scale of her loss.I think also of Michael and Sara Payne who also campaigned with great determination after the murder of their eight-year-old daughter Sarah.As a result, parents and ­carers can now formally ask the police for information about a person who has contact with a childthey fear that person poses a threat.Then there is the Jodie Chesney Foundation, set up by Peter Chesney to tackle kne crime after his daughter was murdered last year.When faced with unimaginable loss, some people respond by taking action to change things.They are gripped with the strength to move mountains — and get the law changed.We salute their courage and their determination to find light amid the terrible darkness of their loss.How sad it is seeing footage of Keeley Bunker dancing with her trusted friend Wesley Streete, who walked her home that evening . . . then went on to murder her.Keeley was a beautul young woman, just  when she died and with her whole le ahead of her.But her “friend” chose to end that le.It is tragic seeing any le wasted – and for what  Streete’s own gratication.Let us hope he is haunted by his actions and choices for the rest of his le.Wonderful news this week as the parents of poor Charlie Gard – who died of a rare genetic condition three years ago – gave birth to a healthy baby boy.As Connie Yates said: “The world feels a whole lot more beautul this morning”.I am so happy for them after the tragedy of losing Charlie, and what a beautul baby.Congratulations.WARNINGS this week that menopausal women could be unfairly denied entry to pubs and restaurantstheir hot flushes are confused in temperature checks for Covid symptoms.Take note: No one in their right mind should keep a menopausal woman from her chilled white wine . . .It feels a bit like a sword of Damocles is hanging over the nation at the moment, with yet more job cuts announced this week – at LGH Hotels, Pizza Express and Wetherspoons.Thousands more workers are living in fear of redundancy. It is a scary prospect. But don’t panic.The best defence is preparation. Find ways to be positive. That means not taking it personally.The ROLE is redundant, not you. So don’t view redundancy as a reflection of your ability or your worth.Know your rights and get the best settlement you can. A proper redundancy process comes with a consultation period, which will give you time to weigh up your options.My advice is to engage in that process. Ask for written clarication of any offer andyou are unhappy in any way, there are plenty of employment lawyers you can talk to. Or free help is available from Acas.Sort out your finances.

Labour councillors and MPs shake their heads about the dangers of opening while never reflecting on the risk of keeping schools closed.Even Labour’s new leader Sir Keir Starmer is worried about safety . . .  and his own children attended school during lockdown.The risks to children from Covid- are next to non-existent. Teachers are more likely to be hit by a bus than contract coronavirus from kids.Butthe risks of the schools opening in September are minimal, the cost of schools staying shut is beyond measure.Already, a generation of kids have seen their education become another victim of coronavirus.Some , of them could not sit their GCSEs in spring. And , could not sit their A levels.The years below them, due to sit those le-changing exams next spring, have lost six months of their education they will never recover.A report by the National Foundation for Educational Research said  per cent of state-school children had between none and one online lesson a day during the long months of lockdown.The most disadvantaged children have suffered the most.The schools are due to open in just  days and the vast majority of parents — almost  per cent — want them to start as planned.But even as Gavin Williamson was making his bold promise to throw open the school gates, Business ­Secretary Alok Sharma was mewing that school closures would be ­considered on a “case by case” basis, while Schools minister Nick Gibb bleats he can’t “decree” that every pupil will be back at their desk in September. These timid Tories must start showing some spine.With the schools closed, parents cannotto work. Already unemployment is soaring. Already there are hard times ahead.If parents and their children stay at home during the autumn months, this country will be on its knees for years.The A-level results will be announced this Thursday and the class of  will finally discover the damage that Covid- has done to their dreams.For the first time ever, A-level grades will be estimated, and there are countless families across the country holding their breath, me included.But for the millions of children meant to be in school, the future is even more uncertain.If their schools do not open in September it will be a craven act of surrender to extremist teaching unions.And a national tragedy that ­effectively chucks an entire generation on the scrapheap.IT is  years since Cameron Diaz made her movie debut opposite Jim Carrey in The Mask and six years since her last film.Cameron says retiring from the movies has brought her the peace she has always craved.And, of course, having an estimated £million in the bank usually has a calming effect.The thieving simpletons responsible for his death will all be free before they turn .The police get endless stick these days.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister hit the road to inspect the measures schools have put in place.He said: “It’s not right that kids should spend more time out of school. It’s much better for their health and mental wellbeing, and obviously their educational prospects,everybody comes back full-time in September. It’s our moral duty as a country to make sure that happens.”Thanks to social distancing and hygiene measures, St Paul’s Church of England Primary School in Swanley, Kent, fully reopened in June.Here, its head teacher blasts the unions for failing children with their “can’t do” attitude. AS a country, we are trying to get back to some sort of normality — and schools have a big part to play in that.Getting children back into the classroom is vital so parents can get back to work.Yet this is proving anything but child’s play.Unions have hit schools with a checklist of  demands before opening next month. This exhaustive list includes assurances that schools will take specic measures to stop children drinking hand sanitiser, extra support for the wellbeing of staff suffering from workload worries, anxiety or the effects of trauma and insisting classes be held “one week on, one week off”.Union members have been urged to present this checklist to headteachers and to expect its completion.It is not helpful. Unions should be working with schools to ensure there is a safe , not creating ision — which is what this will do. If we keep looking at checklists of things that need to be ticked off, we will never get schools reopened.It will never be perfect for everyone. Nothing is. There are always dfering opinions.When askedthe checklist raised the bar too high, NEU president Amanda Martin responded: “This is people’s safety. What cost is safety ”Of course safety is important. But unions should be pulling together and supporting schools, rather than making it very dficult for them to come back.Before my school reopened, I was stunned to hear some unions were encouraging teachers not to engage in conversation with head-teachers. How is that helpful to anyone We have a responsibility to children to be back. If we don’t come back now, when We can’t keep putting it off. We must come back at some point and September is as good a time as any.It is about common sense and making sure the school community is as safe as it can be. Get the basics done from the off and tweak it as we go. That is how it should work.And I know — because I made it work.When we reopened our school in June we followed the guidance the Government set out to the letter.We didn’t have any cases of staff or students falling ill with the virus.We installed a marquee in our playing field to create extra space, as well as supplying portaloos and mobile handwashing facilities to keep pupils and staff safe.Classes were kept apart with inidual entrances and exits. Yes, we are a smaller school with fewer children.But I have fewer staff and less space to play with.As a community, the school came together, did the right thing and got the children back. That’s what it is about: Working with your community — the pupils, parents and staff.Inevitably, there was going to be some sort of drop in pupils’ learning. But children are really resilient. We saw that when they came back.They were straight back into six-hour days, with a full timetable of learning.They dealt with it really well. Actually, they loved coming back to the stability and routine of what they knew.As much as you try to put in a timetable at home, you don’t follow it because the environment is very dferent.I have two children myself and know how hard it was during that time . . . and I’m a teacher.My we and I were both working full-time from home. To get my six-year-old to do more than an hour’s work was incredibly dficult.You don’t get the same experience sitting in front of a screen watching a teacher online as you do being in a classroom interacting with other people.I strongly feel schools have a responsibility to give parents the opportunity to get back into some sort of normality with work.Because we brought all our children back, parents were able to work better from home and do the things they needed to do.We had a number of parents who were made redundant during lockdown.With not having the children at home, they had the chance to look for other work. Meanwhile, their kids were safe.Just this week, Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the “very low” risk to children from Covid- meant the reopening of schools is safe.Research carried out in  institutions across the UK will confirm “there is very little evidence” of coronavirus transmission where pupils have ed.I hope this will help reassure parents, as the negative impact of keeping children away from classrooms runs deeper than their education.The effect on the mental health of our nation’s youngsters could be catastrophic. The social impact of schools is vital.We were back for a month before the summer holidays and that was one of the overriding factors parents talked about. Lots of children were sad, very quiet and not their normal selves during lockdown.But coming back to school really changed them. That was evident from day one.Parents had been concerned about their children’s mental health and could see how happy they were to be back at school, where they were able to interact with their friends and peers and reignite those friendships.It was wonderful to hear children laughing and enjoy- ing each other’s company.That is something you can’t get in lockdown — the social aspect of school le.Schools are at the heart of most communities.Andschools can get back safely, the rest of the community will hopefully follow back into some normality.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Right in the head, I never miss...I am Eagle One. I follow every order. I am happy to be part of the Sinaloa Cartel. Indeed, El Mayos power is felt through every level of authority, with Victor Gerardo Garay Cadena, who was formerly in charge of the federal police anti-drug unit, saying: He is the mastermind of the drug business here in Mexico. Meanwhile a Mexican journalist adds on camera: Mayo is well known that when hes angry, its better for you to hide wherever you can...If they want you dead, youre going to be dead.David Lorino, an ex special agent in Chicagos DEA, managed the agents that put the case against El Mayo together. He explained they began their hunt for him by buying drugs on street corners, before listening into phone calls and tracking the chain back up to Mayo and Chapo.Meanwhile former special agent Jack Riley, who was part of the hunt for him, revealed that their main tactic was to focus on his son and brother - who are less cautious when using phones.They started monitoring his brother Jesus El Rey Zambadas house in Mexico City on October , , before a huge shootout and raid resulted in his arrest. Desperate, Zambada called the chief research officer of the federal police anti-drug unit - who it turned out had been working for the cartel in secret.Zambada was very well protected. Today we understand why - he was surrounded by policemen, Cadena reveals.Because he paid them, as the saying goes, money talks. The police is state-funded but drug dealers pay more.In most of my career, in some areas Ive been, I noticed half of the officers were involved with them.It snowballed from there and El Mayos son, El Vicentillo, was also later arrested.After holding him for two years in complete isolation, agents finally persuaded him that hed only ever be freedhe gave information on the cartel and their enemies.If we can take information from one bad guy, and take another bad guy out of business, is that a bad thing  Lorino says on camera.We told him, youre going to have to tell us about your dad and your dads activities. Thats your only option for probably ever seeing the outside of a jail cell again.Eventually, Mayo himself spoke to his son on the phone and apparently told him: You do what you have to do son, to help yourself and your family.Sure enough, Vicente spoke to officers and Riley explains: He led to probably hundreds of arrests. He showed us how they operate.Chapo, seeing the net closing in, reportedly began to make more public appearances.Towards the end, Chapo became stupid. He started going places he shouldnt and doing public things. Mayo was concerned that Chapo was going to lead to more heat for the organisation, Riley adds.Eladio agrees on camera, saying: He felt over-confident about his safety.Its now widely believed that El Mayo continues to run the cartel in his former partners absense - but with claims hes suffering health issues including diabetes, its unclear for how long.We still think Mayo may be the number one bag guy in the world, Riley admits.Worlds Most Wanted also uncovers the stories of four other wanted fugitives.They include Félicien Kabuga, who is suspected to have been involved in the Rwandan genocide, Samantha Lewthwaite , Sacilian Mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro and Ukrainian-born Russian organised crime boss Semion Mogilevich.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was proud then, and Im proud now to have her as my partner in this campaign.Former President Barak Obama also issued his congratulations to Harris via a Twitter statement.I’ve known Senator [Kamala Harris] for a long time, he captioned a ier statement.She is more than prepared for the job. She’s spent her career defending our Constitution and fighting for folks who need a fair shake.This is a good day for our country. Now let’s go win this thing.In his longer commentary on Bidens VP pick, Obama said he nailed it by selecting Harris.The former US leader described her as the ideal partner to help him [Biden] tackle the very real challenges America faces right now.The announcement comes even after Biden and Harris clashed over racial issues during one of the Democratic presidential debates last year.Harris endorsed Biden in March and this August he told reporters that he had moved on from the tension at the debate, saying I dont hold grudges.However, President Donald Trumps GOP campaign also gave their two cents on Bidens decision on Tuesday.They said his VP selection was proof Bidens an empty shell being filled with the extreme agenda of the radicals on the left in a scathing statement.Biden is no moderate, and with Harris as his ‘political living will,’ he is surrendering control of our nation to the radical mob with promises to raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators, wrote Katrina Pierson, a Trump  senior advisor.At the ballot box, Americans will resoundingly reject the abysmal failures of Biden-Harris in favor of the America First strength of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.Meanwhile, Trump himself confessed that he was surprised Biden picked Harris, claiming shes told many many stories that werent true, and adding, shes very big into raising taxes.Trump cited Harris stance against fracking and petroleum products and her support of socialized medicine.I cant tell you what shes voting for, I think she doesnt know what, Trump told reporters during his Tuesday press briefing.

And I would think that he wouldnt have picked [her].During the Dem debate, Harris had decried Biden working with senators who supported segregation and worked with them to oppose busing [of black students into white school districts].Although Harris said she did not believe you are a racist beforehand, her pointed comments prompted Biden to insist that he “did not praise racists.Harris, , was a presidential candidate last year, the former district attorney of San Francisco and is a current Senator for Calornia.Harris has been married to her husband Douglas Emhoff, a lawyer, for the past six years and has two step-children, Ella and Cole.According to CNN, the presidential and vice presidential candidates will appear together tomorrow at an event in Wilmington, Delaware.Amb.

It would mean teachers have the right to stop workingthey say they feel unsafe because of Covid- risks in the classroom.If the unions exploit this loophole, it jeopardises Boris Johnson’s promises to get schools up and running from September.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was last night under pressure to distance himself from Hendy’s wrecking bid.A Government source said: “Sir Keir Starmer needs to stop dancing to the unions’ tune and start helping to get children back into the classroom safely.”The Sun understands the NEU, the UK’s largest teaching union, attended Hendy’s briefing on his plan. So did the PCS public sector union and the RMT union.The meeting was organised by the Trade Union Coordinating Group in June and his advice has been widely circulated in union circles. Hendy had not last night responded to repeated requests for comment.The leak reveals his plan involves using the  Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations as a loophole.At the virtual meeting, Hendy said the laws “require that the employer shall ensure that the exposure of his employees to ­substances hazardous to health is prevented”.He said: “Substances hazardous to health clearly include the virus Covid-.”He added employees, including teachers in his view, have the right to stop work in “circumstances of danger, which the employee reasonably believed to be serious and imminent and which he could not ­reasonably have been expected to avert”.He added: “Nobody could doubt that ­coronavirus is serious. The imminence of the threat depends on the circumstances of the workplace: The lone tractor driver ploughing a field is not likely to be in such circumstances, school teachers in a small classroom with  kids in them might be in a very dferent situation. So, workers do have rights to refuse work.”Just take their position on Brexit, which has always been as clear as mud.In the coming days though, the electorate will finally get to see what they’re made of.If they stick to Labour’s promise to get kids back in school, they’ll earn the respect of Brits everywhere.If they stay silent while a Labour peer plots to conspire with teaching unions to deprive children of an education, they’ll be shown up as pathetic cowards.Of course we want children and teachers to stay healthy.But given the peak of infection was back in early spring, the robust safety measures schools have put in place for the autumn term look more than adequate to us.Teachers have a moral and civil duty to educate our children, especially when the harm that the enforced absence is having on young minds is becoming painfully clear. And most are itching to get back to work.Sir Keir must stop watching from the sidelines, be vocal, and help the Government get our kids back to school.He can start by seeing off this shameless wrecking bid.The NEU yesterday said: “The NEU is not being advised by Lord Hendy on Covid-. We want schools to open as a priority and to remain open as a priority.”Tory Party chairman Amanda Milling said: “At a time when everyone should be working together to get children back to school, it beggars belief a key Labour figure is actively working to hinder the education of children. It’s time for Sir Keir to come off the fence and unequivocally back efforts to get children back into schools.”A Labour source said: “It’s a matter of record Keir wants schools open in September and making it happen is a priority.

He was denied shelter, clothing, food, not to talk of health care.“He was maltreated by these same people like an animal to the extent that he was feeding on the remnant food of the animals he was tied with and even ate his faeces, until he was rescued by some Human Right activists.“As a result of monstrous and nefarious treatment he was subjected to, he entire lost his senses and behaves exactly like an animal.“What is most surprising is the fact that his father was living in the same house with them while he undergoes this inhumane and savagely cruel treatment.His two evil step mothers, together with his father are currently in police custody, while the  year old Jibril is undergoing treatment and rehabilitation at the Federal Medical Center Birnin Kebbi. What happened to Jibril is the highest level of barbarity and extreme cruelty.I therefore call on the Kebbi State Government to ensure that the culprits face the full wrath of the law.

I pray that the villainous culprits will pay dearly for their atrocity!One person responded: “Just when I thought humanity could never be any more cruel than it is…then along came this thread. Beyond words.Another said it was just pure undiluted evil.One of Jibrils older brothers reportedly told journalists his sibling suffered from epilepsy.He said his family chained the boy to the shed post outside, to stop him from wandering away.The Sun Nigeria reported that his brother also claimed that Jibril was chained up during daylight hours only.The publication was told that a house and car had been sold to fund the boys epilepsy treatment.The rescue teams spokesman DSP Nafiu Abubakar, confirmed: Yes our men have arrested a father and three wives for allegedly chaining the boy for over two years.Our men arrested the suspects on Sunday in Badariya area of Birnin Kebbi Local Government.The boy is at Sir Yahaya Memorial Hospital as the investigation is still ongoing to unravel the circumstances behind chaining the boy in an animal stall for that period.Writing for the BBC about the shocking case, Umaymah Sani Abdulmumin said the “abuse of a son or a daughter and the contempt of a father-in-law have become commonplace in many parts of Nigeria and Africa.“Research shows that many women are jealous of their husbands children and therefore tie them up with hatred, abuse and abuse.“There is no estimate or amount of such domestic violence in Nigeria, but it is usually not uncommon and is often talked about.“However, the re-emergence of the issue at this time came after the unbelief in the negligence of a child, a boy named Jibril Aliyu.“[The story has] provoked outrage and people have reacted angrily to Jibrils mothers rivals.“Severe jealousy is associated with increased ignorance especially in areas where polygamy is practised.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It gobbles down the food straight out of the palm from the brave man who presents it, as the rest of the group remains seemingly unbothered by their guest. Nesbitt, a -year-old bridal store manager, says she captured the moment on Thursday in Deep Creek where her family are staying in a cabin.She told Caters: This was a friends cabin and they said that the bear is always around and never really bothers them.Some of our group are used to being out in the wild so we were all told to not make sudden movements and stay where we were.Most of us were scared to death and filmed from the deck but the brave tested their luck.The group had been enjoying an afternoon filled with beer and food when the black bear sidled up to them.It joined four men and a woman at one of the tables. One of the men in the group grabs a loaf of bread and points his finger at the bear, seemingly telling it to wait for the sandwich to be ready.The man then holds the sandwich in front of the bear and it slowly takes it from his hand as another person starts to prepare a second sandwich to get in on the fun. One of the men sitting at the far side of the table can be seen taking down the stack of beers - just in case. This is a f***ing joke, right  one person can be heard laughing.

Mr Barton told the BBC: The idea of introducing at the eleventh hour a system win which mock exam results trump calculated grades beggars belief.The Government doesnt appear to understand how mock exams work. They arent a set of exams which all conform to the same standards. The clue is in the name mock.Not only are mock exams not standardised but some kids might not have sat them before schools were forced to close in March, Mr Barton warned. In a dramatic U-turn yesterday, Scotland’s education chief John Swinney was forced to allow pupils to be given higher grades based solely on their teacher assessment.Mr Barton said today: If the Government wanted to change the system it should have spent at least a few days discussing the options rather than rushing out a panicked and chaotic response. I think perhaps in response to whats happened in Scotland, what the Government is saying is we need to give another form of appeal to young people. Andwhat that means is they can say point to my mock results, that shows I am better than my final results.So long as thats not automatically guaranteeing that theyre going to get that result, which I think just adds another inequality, then I can understand the thinking there – and I suspect its a Government wanting to show that it too, like the Government in Scotland, is being sympathetic to children and young people in unprecedented times.Research by University College London showed that up to  per cent of predicted grades are an overestimate of exam performance.It also show  per cent of teacher predictions of A-level outcomes from a previous year were inaccurate. Schools minister Nick Gibb told LBC this morning that % of grades will have been adjusted tomorrow but mostly by, the vast majority by just one grade.It could mean that thousands will get lower grades than their teachers thought they should get - and potentially causing fresh confusion for universities and schools across the country.Experts have warned it will likely be the kids in the middle of the class who will lose out.Director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham Professor Alan Smithers said: While teachers will generally have a clear idea of the top performers and those who struggle the most, they will be hard-pressed to distinguish those in the middle.Mr Williamson said every kids wants to know they will be treated fairly. He added that the new system would give students a safety net by letting them rely on their mock results for grades. He said: We are creating a triple process to ensure they can have the confidence to take the next steps forward in work or education.“No one wanted to cancel exams – they are the best and fairest form of assessment, but the disruption caused by Covid- meant they were not possible.“This triple lock system will help make sure that we award the fairest results possible and reassure our young people and help them get on with the next stage of their lives.”The Labour party jumped at the opportunity to urge No to change its position after the chaos in Scotland. Leader Sir Keir Starmer warned that the lives of hundreds of thousands of youngsters could be blighted because “the computer says no”.He said: The SNP have been forced into a humiliating U-turn after a shambolic few days.“With  hours before results are released, I would urge the Prime Minister to change course, or he risks robbing a generation of their future.”Whitehall sources insisted computer moderation would not be scrapped but allowing mock gradeshigher would give pupils extra protection.An extra £million will be handed to schools to fund resit exams in September for pupils unhappy with their marks.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to striking a deal - a prospect long prized by Brexiteers, who see the UKaposs ability to negotiate its own deals as one of the benefits of leaving the EU. “In terms of the timeline of negotiations, it was agreed that they should continue at pace throughout the Autumn, the Department for International Trade said.

Tomorrow, -year-olds up and down the country will get their grades, despite not being able to sit their exams due to coronavirus. And many will be disappointed - because % of those grades are being revised from what teachers first said they should get. The majority of those revised grades are set to be lower than what teachers said students should get. That will prompt chaos as students whoaposd miss out on uni places or jobs launch an avalanche of appeals. And thereaposll be more turmoil next week as GCSE grades arrive, having been working out under the same system. To head off fears about the system, the government last night introduced a last-minute triple lock. The new system will let pupils use their mock exam results from earlier this year to mount an appeal. But the change could raise more problems than it solves - as universities werenapost consulted and school leaders say it beggars belief. Tory ministers have refused to apologise for the last-minute confusion, even giving themselves an aposA-minusapos. So what exactly has happened and how will tomorrowaposs results work under the new system  Hereaposs what you need to know. Are you getting your A-level results tomorrow  What do you think  Join the debate in our comments below. Whataposs the problem   Coronavirus forced schools to shut and meant GCSE and A-level exams were cancelled this summer. But students still need results to leave school with - which have been worked out without those exams. Studentsapos grades in England are based on predicted grades, submitted by their teachers. But those predictions have been moderated by exam boards first, before they get turned into a final grade. This standardisation is supposed to make sure the same standard is applied for all students, whichever school, college or part of the country they come from. But many will see their grades cut as a result. How many students will get lower grades   % of all A-level grades tomorrow have been revised in England. Itaposs safe to say the majority of those have been lowered. Without the standardisation process, grades would have been inflated by % this year. Schools Minister Nick Gibb insisted the vast majority of changes are only by one grade. What is the governmentaposs new announcement   The government announced a new approach on Tuesday night to ensure pupils donapost fall through the cracks. GCSE and A-level students will now get a triple lock, meaning they can effectively take the best result from three options. The first option is to use the standardised grade that all students are getting today. The second option is to appeal using a grade from mock exams earlier in the year. The third option is to re-sit exams in October. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it will provide reassurance to students and ensure they are able to progress with the next stage of their lives. Are there other types of appeal  Yes. Schools can also appeal on the basis of a technical error with the results. And they can appeal by arguing historic data on their performance - used to calculate results - is wrong. This could includethere are specic talented students or a rapid improvement in the school. Why the last-minute change   UK ministers saw the chaos unfolding in Scotland, where more than , students had their grades downgraded under a similar system. Nicola Sturgeonaposs government faces fury after pupils from deprived areas were said to be worst-hit. Schools Minister Nick Gibb said it’s not a coincidence that Englandaposs changes were announced now, as we looked very carefully at what was happening in Scotland. He added: We apologise to nobody for finding solutions, even at the th hour, to stop any student being disadvantaged by this system. Can I just use my mock results automatically   No. Students who want to use a mock exam result can only do so through a formal appeal. The mock exam will have to meet a definition of a valid mock, which is to be set by exams regulator Ofqual. The studentaposs school will be required to submit evidence to their exam board to show the mock was a valid one. This includes it being held under exam conditions. How long will an appeal take  If a studentaposs university place is dependent on an appeal, exam boards will do all that is possible to resolve appeals by September . In all other cases exam boards aim to complete initial reviews within  days of the receipt of an application.Entries for AS  A level re-sits in the autumn have to be made by September . If a student is still awaiting an appeal result, they can enter for a re-sit and then withdraw later onthey donapost need to sit it any more. Could I miss out on my place at uni   In theory, yes. The government has asked universities to be flexible and wait until students have gone through an appeal. Some universities will also offer late starts in January to students who take re-sits in October. But neither of these are compulsory. Mr Gibb admitted not all of them will offer a late start in January, but claimed most will. Does my school have to hold a re-sit for meI want one  Yes, according to minister Nick Gibb. An extra £m has been set aside to help schools with the cost of resits. This includes booking venues, sourcing invigilators, and meeting the cost of autumn exam fees where needed. It could also include booking exam venues outside school grounds. Is everyone happy now  No. Universities were not consulted on the last-minute moving of the goalposts. And the Association of School and College Leaders said using mock results beggars belief. General secretary Geoff Barton said the plan creates the risk of massive inconsistency from school to school, as mock exams are not standardised across the country. Some schools make mocks tougher to push students, while others make them easier to encourage them.  Many students will also not have taken mocks as seriously as they would have taken a real exam. Some students wonapost have a valid mock to judge. Others may not even have taken a mock at all before schools closed in March, leaving their fate to teacher prediction. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to change course or risk robbing a generation of their future.

The Tory Chancellor admitted hard times are here after the economy plunged by a record .% between April and June - the largest recession since records began. He confessed hundreds of thousands face job losses - and said he didnapost have a crystal ball for whataposs next. Mr Sunak told Sky News: “A few months ago I said hard times were coming and today’s numbers show that hard times are here. “Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their job and many more will. Dficult decisions do lie ahead for all of us. He refused to rule out future lockdown measures that could cripple the economy once more to save le. We will take the action that’s required to suppress the spread of the virus, the Chancellor said. [But] I can’t pretend that I have a crystal ball given that we’re dealing with an unprecedented situation.  Todayaposs announcement by the Office for National Statisticsconfirmed what economists already knew. A recession is defined as two successive quarters of decline in gross domestic product , which has not been seen in the UK since  and  during the financial crisis. June did see an .% bounce-back in GDP, meaning the economy could emerge from its recession later this year. But it was not enough to reverse Marchaposs collapse in the V-shaped recovery Boris Johnson hoped for.It comes just a day after ONS data showed , UK workers have been removed from the payrolls of British companies since March.The stark announcement has been declared a tragedy for Britain by Labour. More uncertainty lies ahead as the furlough scheme winds down this month, ending on October . Labour has warned of a tidal wave of redundancies, amid data that shows furlough is still being used for millions of workers to the tune of £bn a week. It pays for % of dormant workersapos wages up to £, a month. Shadow Chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: We’ve already got the worst excess death rate in Europe – now we’re on course for the worst recession too.  That’s a tragedy for the British people and it’s happened on Boris Johnson’s watch. The Prime Minister will say there’s only so much he could do during a global pandemic, but that doesn’t explain why our economy is tanking so badly compared to other countries. It was his government that snatched away wage support for businesses that hadn’t even reopened yet. And his government that failed to get test, trace and isolate working despite claiming it’s a aposworld-beatingapos system. “A downturn was inevitable after lockdown – but Johnson’s jobs crisis wasn’t. Now he must take responsibility, scrap the one-size-fits-all withdrawal of wage support and bring the health crisis properly under control.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tories embroiled unlikely spat ben","story":"NewsTories embroiled in unlikely spat with Ben  Jerrys over treatment of migrantsThe ice cream giant enraged ministers by accusing the Government of a lack of humanity towards the influx of people making the perilous Channel crossingShareCommentsByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  AUG NewsHome Secretary Priti Patel has stepped up efforts to prevent migrant crossings in the Channel amid criticism of the Governments hardline approach \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"What is really going on in politics  Get our daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It also covers in great depth the fallout between Harry and his brother Prince William, tensions with the Duchess of Cambridge and other frustrations at le behind palace walls. Ahead of publication the Sussexesapos team released a statement saying they were not interviewed for the book, but Scobie and Durand have now said they spoke to the couple when appropriate. The Sussexes wrote: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to Finding Freedom. This book is based on the authorsapos own experiences as members of the royal press corps and their own independent reporting. Writing in the authorsapos section of the book, Scobie and Durand say: We have spoken with close friends of Harry and Meghan, royal aides and palace staff , the charities and organisations they have built long-lasting relationships with and, when appropriate, the couple themselves. In many instances, we have granted sources anonymity to allow freedom to candidly provide direct quotes without their names being attributed .  Many iniduals have also spoken to us on what is known as on-background, meaning the information from conversations can be used as guidance but no quotes repeated. In a few cases, conversations have been strictly off-the-record. Some of the scenes in this book have been witnessed personally while for others we have relied on the consistency of accounts provided by sources we have been given access to and come to trust. Conversational dialogue in scenes featured in the book has been drawn directly from accounts shared by multiple sources who have corroborated the same information. Royal experts have continuously questioned claims that Meghan and Harry were not involved in the book, which went on sale yesterday. Well placed sources told the Mirror how the book paints a “very one sided account” that “will leave lasting scars” on the couple’s relationships with senior royals.  A palace source said: One may indeed wonder who those two sources are. It’s fair to say there is a great deal of skepticism over the involvement of the book’s two primary subjects. It’s sadly hard to imagine a world where this won’t do lasting damage to many of the personal relationships explored in this very one sided account.

But a routine scan just one month after he was given the all-clear revealed the tumours had spread to his lungs and liver – before nurses told his heartbroken mum Eni they could only offer a short-term solution. Eni, , now fears the delay in getting a diagnosis meant the treatment was too little, too late – and believes Erikaposs only hope is a place on a £, clinical trial in New York. Speaking from the family home in Uxbridge, London, she told the Mirror how three GPs dismissed Erikaposs excruciating back pain as a pulled muscle – before a fourth doc gave in and sent him for a scan after she refused to leave hospital without an explanation. She wept: For the rest of my le Iaposll wonder what would have happenedthose first doctors had sent him for X-ray. They said it was a pulled muscle or growing pains, but it was hurting Erik so much he couldnapost go to school for two weeks. I knew it was something more serious – I think it was my motheraposs instinct. We went to hospital and begged a fourth doctor to examine him, and she agreed to send him for an X-ray.  The X-ray revealed that the boy had a cm tumour on one of his ribs, which was already spreading to his lungs. Eni continued: He was so brave going through all that chemo and radiation treatment, and we really thought he was through the worst of it when he rang the bell after his last round of therapy. But the CT scan a month later shattered us into pieces. It showed it had come back and spread to his lungs and liver.  The nurses said they could only add months with short-term treatment.

Undercover footage shared with the Mirror shows animals trapped in tiny cages at one market on the Thai island of Phuket. Some of the pooches appear to be happy but this is just a ploy by traders, who keep them deprived of water to encourage aposcuteapos behaviour, experts say. The markets sell aposfashionableapos fluffy breeds, such as Pomeranians, which are unsuitable for the Thai climate, an animal rights group claims. The animals allegedly come from rural puppy farms, where they are kept in horric conditions and suffer from starvation, skin diseases and more. Sam McElroy, campaign manager at the animal rights group Soi Dog Foundation, said: Some British expats will be buying at these markets. Have you been a victim of dogfishing  Email webnews@mirror To them, I would say... donapost kid yourself as to where these puppies came from. There is no kennel club in Thailand. There is no reputable breeder scheme. They came from puppy mills. And these places are completely unregulated and the conditions y from poor to despicable. He said undercover footage from a puppy market in Phuket showed a mix of Thai and foreign customers. In the footage, some dogs can be seen hyperventilating, while others simply appear exhausted.  What do you think about puppy farms  Join the debate in the comments below He added: The undercover clips show a iety of puppies for sale, some older than others. They are kept in cramped cages and, as you can see, bowls are upturned and not refilled, meaning they can go for hours without water in humid conditions. A lot of the puppies you see in the clips are lethargic and sad looking. If you go up to the cages, the puppies either come straight to you asyou are their best friend ever, or they lie there, looking sad.  It’s a  impression. Unscrupulous puppy vendors know that pups that react in this way are more appealing, and therefore more likely to be bought. So they give the puppies no food or water. The aposhappyapos puppies are desperately thirsty. The apossadapos ones are simply exhausted. Mr McElroy claims some foreigners buy pooches from the markets and then dump them when they leave the island.  The puppy farms supplying these shops specialise in aposcuteapos breeds, such as huskies, which often have heavy coats. The dogs are usually sickly with poor immune systems by the time they reach the market because they have been ripped away from their mothers at such a young age, Mr McElroy said. He added that any pooches that cannot be sold by the traders are often dumped on the side of the road or at temples."},{"url":null,"title":"can you put hot water","story":"NewsCan you put hot water bottles in the freezer  Why you must be careful with cooling hackPeople have been trying to keep cool at night during the heatwave.

The summer heatwave has seen daytime temperatures go as high at C, while at night people have been trying all sorts of tricks to try and cool down enough to get some shut eye. One hack is to fill up a hot water bottle before bed and put it in the freezer. The woman who tried it shared it on the group Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK, saying: “If youaposre feeling the heat, fill a hot water bottle no more than   full of cold water and pop it in the freezer for a few hours. It stays cold for hours especially at night. Bliss! Good Morning Britain’s Kate Garraway admitted to trying the hack herself, telling viewers: It does work, it does help definitely. While some, including Kate Garraway, have been impressed with the idea, others have expressed caution. GMB’s doctor, Sarah Jarvis, said people should not forget to “never put ice directly onto your skin because that can cause ice burns”. Placing it in a pillow case or wrapping it up would help avoid that problem, though water is likely to still seep through and leave a wet mark on the bed sheets. Others have also advised using dferent hot water bottles for winter and summer, as the cold water and freezing could damage the seal.This can potentially lead to boiling hot water spilling out when using it to keep warm and causing burns.

Andyou ever wanted to know what scrubbing off a hundred tags in  degree heat for over  hours looks like, well the last photo says it all .

She said: I feel awful because of this horric event in my le and I wish to express my deep regret for the damage by my name written on the Jurassic Coast.  I have learned a huge lesson, one which will forever mark me. I reached back to the community to meet all the people who sacriced their precious time to fix this disaster.

I am disappointed that I didnapost understand it at the time and I donapost want anyone  making the same mistake.  Maybe nothing will undo the damage the writing caused but I will try to make things better and I hope people will give me the chance. James Weld, owner of the Lulworth Estate which owns Durdle Door, described scenes over the weekend as aposhorrendousapos. He said: We have a support team that are litter picking day and night and there are some fantastic volunteers as well. They donapost just clean up after people, they offer advice and hand out rubbish bags to people on the beach. We try and educate people but we canapost speak to every person.  Itaposs constant. On Sunday morning we took about  bags and there was about  from Friday. Itaposs horrendous. It is a natural environment and managing it is a complete nightmare. Itaposs extraordinary how some people are behaving.

A-level results day this year is on Thursday August , and will be a time when students find outthey’ve got the grades they were hoping for andthey’ve been accepted into their first choice universities. It can be an anxious wait, but this year even more so with summer exams cancelled due to the coronavirus lockdown, meaning results will be calculated dferently this year. Schools and colleges have sent exam boards the grade they believed each student was most likely to achieve, and, within each subject, students ranked in performance order for each grade. This will take classwork, homework, assignments, mock exams non-exam assessments and coursework completed during the last two years and combined with past performance of their schools to help standardise the results.However, with up to % of results expected to be revised, students will have the ability to use a triple lock to essentially take the best result from three options. Either:Use the standardised grade that all students are getting Appeal using their mock grade Re-sit exams in OctoberWhen it comes to learning their grades, students can still find out in the usual manner. For more than a decade now A-level results have been published online, enabling students to log on from home and The Universities and Colleges Admissions Servicepublishes all results on its Track  from am on Thursday. Students will need their personal Track IDs and passwords to access their grades and find outthey’ve been accepted onto their preferred course at their first choice university.

Kusi Kimani, , from East Sussex, was shocked when she discovered a brown bra on the retaileraposs website was called tobacco. The lighter colours of the £ Marks  Spencer Collection padded bras are described as cinnamon and fudge. Ms Kimani complained about the bra for her skin tone carrying negative connotations, while more positive words were used for lighter colours. Yet two months on from her initial complaint, the bra is still being sold in a tobacco colour on the Marks  Spencer website. However, the retailer pledged to drop the name when approached by the Mirror and apologised for not acting sooner. Ms Kimani told : I saw it about two weeks after George Floydaposs death and it was particularly raw to see at that time. Why not call it cocoa, caramel or chocolate - sweet dessert items  But they used tobacco. I was shocked when I saw it. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror Itaposs hurtful to me and my friends. If a young girl who is already uncomfortable with the colour of her skinshe will be feeling even more alienated. Each week that website is showing that racism is another week a young girl may come across it and feel bad for the rest of her le. To see that apostobaccoapos is for their skin tone will make them feel unwanted by society. Tobacco is referred to in society as bad, unhealthy, and highly likely to kill - ‘smoking kills’.  This is an example of how bias is ingrained into society and only helps fuel racism, be it overt or covert, however in this instance this is a form of covert racism. The pharmaceutical clinical trials manager said she just wanted Marks  Spencer to change the name online - and to explain its reasons for the delay. The companyaposs customer service team previously told her that its colour names were not supposed to carry negative connotations.  In an email on June , the retailer said it was reviewing its naming convention and also looking at its product range with BAME staff. The message said: The names we use are taken from those on a colour palette and were never designed to match to a skin tone - I would like to assure you the choice of names is absolutely not intended to carry any negative connotations. We review design trends in the market each year to ensure we are offering a fashionable palette to all our customers, and we are actively reviewing our naming convention in the light of the feedback we are receiving.  We liaise with our store colleagues on a regular basis to determine which colours we need to offer our customer and we are also working with our BAME colleague network to receive their input too. The customer service representative said the company knows it had to have a better, wider skin colour offer, particularly for black and dark skin tones. They added that the range is currently under review so improvements can be made. Ms Kimani told : I approached Marks  Spencer as I thought it could have been an oversight. It shouldnapost be a matter of having to fight to be taken seriously. They are willing to stand with the Black Lives Matter movement but they are not willing to put in the work to make changes. In the past I would have been upset about it and buried it away. But this BLM movement has given me courage.

The apparent dig at Kate and Williamaposs home setup is one of a number of claims in a new biography about the Sussexes, Finding Freedom. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand detail how Meghan and Harry originally didnapost want a nanny to help with their childcare, but quickly changed their minds and have had three dferent employees since. They also claim the couple were forced to sack one on her second night due to irresponsible behaviour, leaving them extremely nervous. However, unlike the Cambridges, Meghan and Harryaposs staff donapost live with them, instead just coming to the house to work then going home. Maria Borrallo, the Norland nanny who looks after George, Charlotte and Louis, lives in Kensington Palace with the family ensuring sheaposs always on hand to help when needed. Scobie and Durand write: Harry and Meghan had agreed that they didnapost want their home filled with staff. Harry had seen that situation at Williamaposs home and didnapost want the same for his family.  He and Meghan liked the idea that when they went to bed at night, it was just the three of them in the house. Cozy and private. When they first decided to employ a nanny they looked for a night nurse to help them sort out Archieaposs sleeping pattern. However, their first hire ended badly when they were forced to sack her as they were unhappy with her behaviour. Speaking about what they describe as an incident with the first, they write: They decided to hire a night nurse to establish a sleep schedule and be an extra pair of helping hands. But their time with the couple brief. Meghan and Harry were forced to let the nurse go in the middle of her second night for being unprofessional and irresponsible. Despite the bad experience, Meghan and Harry decided to try another nanny.

It is understood that the locomotive and three carriages derailed, and slid down an embankment, with  people thought to have been on the train at the time.

To make matters worse, school careers lasting  years ended not with a raucous graduation blow-out, but - at best - socially distanced whimpers. And now millions of school leavers are left having to decide whether to go to a stripped down version of university in September, defer or make new plans. Despite widespread predictions that higher education would be rendered a ghost town next year, the trend has not borne out. Can students afford gap years  Rather than mass-deferrals to , current data suggest thats there has been a % increase in people un-deffering. As much as the prospect of socially distanced freshers weeks, virtual drinking games and toga-parties for one may not fill the young student heart with excitement, heading to university this year may not be a bad idea. Not only will the cut back social le leave studying front and centre of the undergradaposs le, getting to work may be a smart move as a deep recession hits.  The pace at which the economy is slowing down may also be enough to put young people off having a gap year for fear trips away may be more dficult to finance. For those coming to the end of their undergraduate degrees, holding off from plunging into the world of work may seem wise, whether via a post-graduate degree or trip away. A study by Prospects showed % of final-year students have had job offers cancelled or deferred since the crisis.  Will universities allow students to defer  Another aspect wannabe students may want to consider is whether universities will allow them to defer. Many institutions have said that they cannot guarantee places for a year from now, such is the turmoil and chaos caused by the virus. Jude Tyrrell from Saltdean wants to defer the year but Cambridge, where he has a place to study computer science, but has been told by the university that offers cannot be guaranteed for . Despite that, the prospect of embarking on a whittled-back university experience is not filling the -year-old full of joy.“It just feels like my experience is going to be vastly dferent to everyone  I know,” he told The .  How easy is foreign travel for a gap year  For students like Jude who may not want to take up their place this year, there are many other choices - evendeferring is not on the cards. One of the obvious options is going abroad. While international travel has been made more dficult by the virus, there are still a lot of opportunities for young people abroad, albeit some requiring a period of quarantine onto the UK. Fluent English speakers are still sought after as foreign languages teachers, or via online language schools such as Go Overseas. Equally the holiday market is favouring the brave buyer at the moment. Cut price deals on flights are there to be found for those willing to run the risk of contracting the coronavirus on a long haul flight or get stuck in a far-flung country.  What to do on a gap year at home For those wanting to stay at home there may well be a surplus of volunteering oppirtunities.

The figures, taken from the American Academy of Pediatrics from July  to , come as the country tops five million cases - , of which are children - and over , deaths. As some schools re-open for face-to-face classes this month, Dr Tina Hartert, of Vanderbilt University, said increased testing of kids is key to understanding their role in transmitting the killer bug. The doctor is leading a government-funded study which has seen , families receive DIY testing kits. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE    The kits are shipped to the families, they are taught how to collect these samples, and then the samples are sent back by the families to a central repository, she told CBS News. It was initially believed children were less susceptible to the virus - however, at least  kids have died in the US in July from Covid-. Itaposs left teachers and school bosses desperately looking for solutions on how to follow restrictions while educating pupils.Some universities are also grappling with safely reopening campuses, with new restrictions including banning parties, road trips and outside visitors. A photo at North Paulding High School, Georgia, where schools have already re-opened, went viral last week showing pupils not wearing masks. It comes after Facebook deleted a post by US president Donald Trump  for the first time after he shared a clip in which he claimed children are almost immune. The social media  deemed this a violation of its rules against sharing misinformation about the  coronavirus. The clip came from an interview with Fox  Friends earlier that day. The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionhas said that while adults make up most of the known Covid- cases to date, some children and infants have been sick with the disease and they can also transmit it to others. During a briefing at the White House on the same day, Trump repeated his claim that the virus had little impact on children. Children handle it very well, he told reporters. If you look at the numbers, in terms of mortality, fatalities ... for children under a certain age ... their immune systems are very very strong and very powerful.

The homemade camera trap was programmed to detect movement and when it was triggered, the camera and flash would spring into action and take a series of photos. Returning to the site each week to check the footage he had obtained, Jeff was left disappointed until he came across a sequence of images left by an unexpected visitor. It captured a man in a hi-vis vest who had stumbled across the camera and seized the opportunity to pose for a series of photos lying playfully on a fallen tree trunk. Jeff had ed to the site on a regular basis to change the batteries in the camera and said: I got a few images of critters including raccoons, weasels, a few bobcat photos, and a number of birds, but nothing I was super happy with so I left the camera there.

The -year-old woman, who had the illness for the first time in February before recovering a few months later, tested positive again on August . She is now under quarantine and treatment in Jingzhou, a city in central China,  with officials urging people not to panic. Local Government said all those she has been in contact with have tested negative for the disease. There is no evidence of a risk of transmission from relapsed cases, it added.There have been previous reports of people catching coronavirus twice, although scientists have been sceptical and instead believe these anomalies were caused by testing errors.The Jingzhou womanaposs case comes after scientists at the University of Amsterdam discovered that immunity to coronavirus may only last for six months. Researchers tested  men for four coronaviruses, which cause the common cold, regularly over the course of  year and found that there was aposan alarmingly short duration of protective immunityapos.They found that after six months the levels of antibodies had substantially reduced and by  months people were frequently reinfected with the virus,  The Times reported.  Professor Lia van der Hoek, one of the researchers involved in the study, previously told The Times: Herd immunity is an issue, even with vaccination, as it may be that people can get an infection again within six to  months. It is, however, uncertain what kind of disease is associated with a reinfection by Sars-CoV-, that is of course a big uncertainty. Kingaposs College London scientists also found that immunity to coronavirus could be lost within months of contracting the killer bug. They discovered levels of antibodies - the bodyaposs main line of defence - were at their highest around three weeks after symptoms arose but quickly decline.

The word reliance often is used in the same breath but the Edinburgh side are so much more than that.Of course, with Horgan and Boyle, they use the wide areas well, with both players capable of bombing forward with terrying speed.However, what should scare their opponents more is the balance Hibs possess. It is something Ross is big on – his team being able to move and create space for each other.Everyone knows their roles and they seem to interchange like a finely-tuned machine.Full-backs Josh Doig and Paul McGinn overlapped at will against Livingston, with -year-old Doig getting beyond Horgan with regularity as Hibs overloaded the left side of the pitch.Gogic and Newell worked in tandem to control the middle of the park, while goalkeeper Ofir Marciano and centre-halves Ryan Porteous and Paul Hanlon weren’t scared to work with the ball at their feet either.Conversely, a lot of Hibs’ problems still lie at the back.Where their wide defenders seem to relish the wing back side of their role, defending as full backs they look susceptible to being overrun.United should be tasking Jamie Robson and Liam Smith, impressive in attack so far, to get at them.In the heart of the defence, giving away silly fouls, particularly on the edge of the box, looks like a major Achilles heel for the Hibees.Too often at Livingston, Porteous and Hanlon flew into challenges and created dangerous situations for their team, with Livingston’s consolation strike coming from a penalty the former needlessly gave away.A little bit of pressure could cause them to crumble and neither would enjoy the physical battle with big Louis Appere just days after Lyndon Dykes caused them problems.One benefit of games with no fans is you can hear almost every interaction on the park and in the dugouts.While Livi’s players and management launched verbal volleys at each other for the duration on Saturday, Hibs sauntered through the -plus minutes with an unwavering self-belief.They seem to possess a quiet confidence and a discipline that guides them through games, no doubt stemming from boss Ross himself.Although Hanlon is the captain, he is more of a silent leader. The Hibees are a side ruled by committee and governed by high standards and accountability.From experienced heads like Maricano and Horgan to younger players like Porteous and Doig, no one was found hiding.It would be obvious, and correct, to say Hibs’ main man is Nisbet – particularly after his three goals.However, with Scott Allan, so often the key man, riding the pine in West Lothian, it was Newell who really stepped up to the plate.The former Rotherham and Peterborough midfielder dictated the tempo superbly for the Leith men, picking out some delightful passes and taking up set-piece responsibilities, too.Horgan, too, impressed out wide and, despite it being a quiet day at the office for him, Boyle always seemed like he was about to make something happen.However, Newell was the man who made Hibs tick and one United, particularly Calum Butcher, will have to keep a close eye on.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

This happened during the latter phase of Brexit, to some extent under Boris Johnson, but in particular under Theresa May.#But that is rather dferent to the ing of the Cabinet of the UK Government.#The Cabinet Manual itself, which sets out the main rules for the conduct of government, makes clear what Westminster#s relationship with the devolved administrations should look like.The manual specically states that devolved governments are #separate administrations and not subject to the collective responsibility# and as such #consideration should be given to writing separately where they have an interest#.It adds that in some #exceptional# circumstances #ministers from the devolved administrations may be invited to attend meetings#.There are other forums in which ministers from the UK and devolved governments can meet, but as we have previously reported they have been widely criticised.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

","title":"jim bett has seen football suspended in iceland due to second spike and former aberdeen midfielder begs scottish stars to follow rules","story":"Aberdeen legend Jim Bett has urged Scottish football to take heed of the government’s latest warning – or risk a complete shutdown.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued a “yellow card” to the Premiership after another breach of lockdown restrictions.Aberdeen’s scheduled game tonight against Hamilton has been postponed, as has this weekend’s trip to face champions Celtic.The Dons’ scheduled clash at St Johnstone on Saturday was already axed after eight Aberdeen players went to a city centre bar in breach of lockdown restrictions.In a fresh blow for Scottish football, Celtic’s Boli Bolingoli broke quarantine rules by flying to Spain, meaning he should have self-isolated for  days.The Belgian did not inform the Hoops of his trip, nor did he quarantine.Dons legend Bett is now based in Icelend, where football is suspended due to a recent spike in Covid- cases.He said: “Everyone in Scottish football must take heed of the guidance otherwise the game could be shut down.“The recent Aberdeen and Celtic incidents have been very high profile, so hopefully everyone gets the message and realises how serious this is.“When you are a football player, you are very fit and think you are immune to everything – but you are not.“Hopefully from here on in every footballer will take heed of the guidelines and follow them.”The first minister has warnedthere are further breaches Scottish football could be shut down.Bett said: “The first minister has set out a plan and rightly expects everyone to follow it.“She has given a bit of leeway to the Scottish game to try to get football going again.“It would be devastatingthey do shut it down again.“Supporters were so glad football was back even though they couldn’t go to games.“Even watching it on television was bringing back some sort of normality.“Hopefully footballers learn from this about just how serious a situation we are all in.”Celtic have apologised for Bolingoli’s actions and confirmed they will take disciplinary action against the defender.The Joint Response Group confirmed that between August  and August  a total of , Covid- tests were carried out at Scottish Premiership clubs, Championship Hearts, and Glasgow City, with two positive results recorded.Icelandic football has been suspended for two weeks after a recent spike, although numbers are signicantly below Scotland.Former Scotland midfielder Bett said: “We managed to get back to almost normal before it spiked with tourists coming in so they shut football down as a result.“The coronavirus numbers were zero today over here so hopefully football will come back on Friday as planned.“However, we have to remember that even though numbers are going down it only takes a few incidents to get it back up.”Aberdeen’s clash with Hamilton tonight was initially scheduled to go ahead despite the local lockdown in the Granite City following a Covid- cluster linked to city centre bars.However, after discussions yesterday morning with the Minister for Public Health, Sport and Wellbeing Joe FitzPatrick a request was received – and subsequently agreed to by the Joint Response Group – for the postponement of the upcoming games over the next week involving Aberdeen and Celtic.The JRG subsequently offered to work on a range of measures, involving the whole of Scottish professional football, to underpin a commitment to raising public health awareness and reaffirm the collective responsibility of the national game.Rod Petrie, chairman of the JRG, accepts there is now no margin for error.Petrie said: “The Joint Response Group has acted swtly and decisively in addressing the latest concerns raised by the minister on behalf of the Scottish Government.“While the decision to postpone these games is deeply regrettable nevertheless in the circumstances it is unavoidable and uncontestable.“The JRG members were astounded to learn of the recklessness demonstrated by Boli Bolingoli-Mbombo in his breach of government public health guidance and football protocols.“That this comes on the back of eight Aberdeen players showing similar disregard for public health is disrespectful not just to every football team-mate, fellow player and colleague but also to every fan in this country.“It is also hugely damaging to the image, reputation and sustainability of the game.“Clubs and players are in no doubt that there is now no more margin for error and no more scope for further breaches.“Players must heed the warning of the first minister that this is a yellow card moment for Scottish football.”National Clinical director Jason Leitch said he worked hard on Monday to convince the first minister to give the go-ahead for Aberdeen’s game against Hamilton.However as he was in a -minute Zoom call with all the managers and captains of Premeirship teams to emphasise their responsibilities, news of Balingoli’s breach emerged.Leitch said: “With Mr FitzPatrick the sports minister I spent a lot of time on Monday to get all our ducks in a row to allow the Aberdeen game to go ahead.“To persuade the first minister that was the right thing to do.“If there are breaches from now it is going to be very hard for the advisers to say to the first minister we have confidence in the sport bubbles.”SPFL Chief Executive Neil Doncaster hit out at the “thoughtless” and “selfish” acts of a minority who delivered a kick in the teeth to players and officials.He said: “The vast majority of players and officials who have strictly observed the necessary restrictions will rightly see this as a real kick in the teeth.”For as little as £. a month

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July .

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing.

I#d thought with it being near a pre-historic site they might say no, but he thought it sounded great. I was a bit taken aback. The forestry people were also up for it and all of a sudden it was all go,# said Gabi.Weather depending, it should take  days from start to finish. The first job is to clear brambles and other trip hazards before the lime washing can be applied.Dr Aaron Watson from Kilmartin Museum will be documenting the project.Gabi continued: #When I was researching what to white the stumps with I knew I wanted to use something traditional to Scotland that would not contaminate the place. Limewash is used to paint houses here. Then I discovered it creates crystals. Rockart was made using quartz # they would peck at rocks with it to make their marks. I liked the link. It was a good coincidence.#The shape will change depending on where it is seen from. As visitors walk towards it, it will be like an oval but once at the rockart site it will look like a circle.To follow Ormaig Landart Project follow these links:  Instagram: @gstuckemeier"},{"url":null,"title":"rest and be thankful diversion route to close for second night","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFor the second night running the old military road ersion route at the Rest and be Thankful will close.Met Office weather warnings for thunderstorms mean that the route, which runs below the landslide-hit A trunk road, will close overnight again from pm on Tuesday August  as a safety precaution.The local ersion route closed during the hours of darkness on Monday night due to forecast heavy rain, re-opening around am on Tuesday.All traffic will be erted from pm on to the standard ersion route via the A, A, A and A.

I think it was Michael Gove who said, Your example gives us hope.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to.

and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"confident-borders-schools-safe-says-council-chief","story":"THE leader of Scottish Borders Council says she has \"every confidence\" that schools have been made safe

Amanda had been diagnosed in November  and given  weeks to live.David and Trevor are raising money for Pancreatic Cancer UK after Trevor was diagnosed with an aggressive form of the condition in November last year,  months after Amanda.His diagnosis is terminal and he has received  chemotherapy sessions.Trevor was also given  weeks to live but chose to go through treatment to extend his le.He is receiving more treatment in September.This is not the first time that the pair have embarked on a tour like this and it was this previous trip that inspired them to go again.In Christmas , David received a present to go on a motorbike ride and the following February he left with Trevor to go on a -day tour around Europe.However, they were on their trip during the Beast from the East snowstorm of early , which saw them ride through snow in mainland Europe.David, who owns a couple of coffee shops in London, said: ldquoWe went through the Swiss Alps, France and Italy and people were following us through France and beeping their horns at us, so we said thatwe ever do this again that we must do it for charity.The pair then set up their own website, called the Hairless Bikers www.hairlessbikers, inspired by lsquoHairy Bikersrsquo David Myers and Si King with their own twist, as both David and Trevor are bald.The pair were planning their next trip until Amandarsquos terminal diagnosis, with David saying the news came ldquoall of a sudden.After Amandarsquos death, David spent time dealing and coming to terms with his loss and then Trevor received his diagnosis.And when the coronavirus pandemic started earlier this year, it added to an already dficult year.The pair were waiting for Trevor to finish his chemotherapy before starting the tour, with Trevor phoning David last month and askinghe wanted to go.David told the Courier before he set off: ldquoWersquove always said we will do it but now itrsquos all go.ldquoTrevor phoned me last weekend and said: lsquoLetrsquos just do it.rsquo If we donrsquot do it now then itrsquos never going to happen.ldquoWe thought about all of the news going on at the moment andanything happens or we need to come back we are just in Europe so can easily catch a plane home.Ahead of the trip, David said he was ldquovery excited, adding he was just going to focus on riding and see what happened.He added: ldquoWe wonrsquot stop laughing, wersquoll be like little kids.An initial target of pound was raised, with more than pound, raised in a few days.David saidan average of pound a day could be raised ldquothat will be brilliant.Donate at www.facebook donate  "},{"url":null,"title":"column-tory-disarray-not-reassuring","story":"It cannot be reassuring for the Scottish Tories that their leader has only been in the position since February and has now left the party in disarray.It is clear the party do not hold Scottish Parliament seats in a high regard, given that it is looking likely that the next leader will be Douglas Ross, who is not even currently an MSP.Scottish Parliament seats require a member who is willing to commit time and effort to their constituency, they are not simply a stepping stone for jumping into a leadership bid.If you compare the Toriesrsquo leadership with that of Nicola Sturgeon over the last few months, with her clear and consistent messaging throughout the Covid- crisis, it is easy to see why polls for the SNP and independence are through the roof.I know that many are looking forward to enjoying the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which will offer discounts of up to  per cent at restaurants and cafeacutes throughout August.I welcome this help for local businesses, and I am sure that this will benefit them in their restarts following lockdown.I would like to stress, however, that guidelines should always be followed within these establishments.That means that you should be socially distancing from those who are not from your household or extended household, and you should maintain good hygiene by regularly washing your hands for  seconds, as well as not touching your face.To keep yourself safe, it is important to use businesses that are taking these measures seriously and putting safety precautions in place to protect their customers.This week I will be hosting the first meeting of the Esk River Improvement Group.I look forward to working with them to make progress towards cleaning up the Esk."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-mist-midges-memories","story":"Oh and I forgot to mention the midges, which add a particularly Highland flavour to any camping trip up north.Such was our experience last weekend after we managed to find a campsite that was open. We managed just one overnight stay in Glen Nevis.It has always been a favourite glen of mine.Its beauty challenges the majestic Glencoe, but its landscape is gentler and less rugged, and the upper reaches of the glen take you back in time, to the majesty of the ancient Caledonian forest.In the days when I was a tour guide, I always thought that mist and rain were an essential part of a trip to the Highlands.People would refer to hot and sunny weather as good weather, but Irsquod always say that in the Highlands mist and rain can be good weather too.On such days, the weather would add the veil of mystery and unpredictability that makes the landscape so intriguing.Hardly ever was the approach to Glencoe the same because of the weather it changes the landscape in ways the imagination could never predict.Swirling mists which dress the peaks, layers of low lying cloud which suddenly break to allow sparkling rays of sunshine itrsquos spine-tinglingly magical.On days of so called good weather, when the skies were a cloudless blue, I always felt there was something missing in the experience.I know all this might sound like patter from VisitScotland attempting to persuade rain drenched tourists that they are lucky to have experienced the true mystery of our country but for me it has always been true.Of course, days of endless pelting rain are no fun and can spoil a holiday, but for me, some mist and rain, in moderation, makes a Highland holiday all the more memorable.Such was our experience last weekend, with two days that seemed to be in dferent seasons.When we arrived we were lucky to be able to put up the tent just in time, before the rain got heavy.Itrsquos always an awkward moment for me putting up our tent in full view of other campers, as we struggle to remember which pole goes where and try not to look like we need assistance.It couldrsquove been easy to be despondent at the weather. Dark brooding clouds shrouded the sides of Ben Nevis, bringing rain that threatened to dampen everything but I refused to let it dampen our spirits.I recited the famous quote: ldquoIn Scotland there is no such thing as bad weather just bad clothing.We had a hearty camp stove meal and then set off for our walk in the Nevis Gorge.Itrsquos a well kent walk now, but when I was first taken many years ago before the internet it was a relatively unknown secret. I still remember the sense of awe as I heard the roar of the river below, and the sight of the distant waterfall An Steall as we emerged from the gorge.Our trick was to go on our walk when it was raining, and after teatime so we had the place almost to ourselves, well apart from the midges.Our midge repellent was gold dust, and Irsquove always found the trick in avoiding midges is to keep moving, which we did, except for once, and we momentarily paid the price.It was a walk in the childhood footsteps of my younger self, where my young children were re-pacing along the route also taken by their older siblings years ago.It was about saying ldquohere is a place important to me, part of who I am itrsquos yours now,you want it to be.Yet not saying it with words, but by making memories that I hope will last as long as mine have.The rain and mist was all part of it, and yes even the midges. As often happens, the weather began to clear as we headed back.The sun broke through and the clouds developed a sparkling yellow tint. The mountains appeared, like giants awoken and rising to their true height.Sunshine briefly warmed our faces and it seemed a gt from the gods for our endurance.The kids danced and sang the song ldquoI can see clearly now the rain has gone as they saw a rainbow.I knew the rain hadnrsquot really gone so we didnrsquot dally.We made it back to the car, tired with sore legs, but before the next dark cloud arrived.That evening we recounted our experiences in the tent, and I told stories about the Jacobites and the old Highland way of le, and the connection to the Battle of Prestonpans on our own doorstep.The kids listened, partly because we were camping and they had no screens, so no choice but Irsquod like to believe partly also because we were in a land where stories and legends are steeped in the soil and they now felt a small part of them.It lashed with rain all night. But its rage had ended by morning and the new day welcomed us with sunshine.New adventures beckoned, with other memories to impart, on what was to become our sunny day.Loch Oich, rich in family memory and where the ashes of both my parents were scattered.Then Loch Ness, a fitting end to a pilgrimage, especially for my monster daft wee boy, and his sisters who love the mystery of the story.Such was our short ldquostaycation this summer.Wersquod followed what I have always called The Road of Legends which is the title of my yet to be published novel, an abridged version of which will be

morning cycle.As I came out from Musselburgh Lagoons towards the mouth of the Esk, I saw the magnicent sight of all the seabirds, the swans and the geese gathered at that point where river meets sea.It occurred to me then that my best holiday this year could be to live in my own place as though I were a tourist.In my own hometown, I can still be awed by unexpected beauty, delighted by the

sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you focus on

midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"new-head-education-named","story":"Ms Brown is currently the chief operating officer for education with the local authority and will take the place of Fiona

And thats all alongside the awful things happening in Irish convents and childrens homes.

Where it is useful though, is in shting the debate in a way that allows a comparison of characteristics often associated with male or female, while avoiding the need to constantly qualy any statements with the awkward tag of not all women or not all men.

Theyre the one point of contact between the vehicle and the road, meaning any issue with them could prove disastrous. Its why its so important to check them. Look at the sidewalls for any cuts or damage which could lead to a puncture, and scope out the general condition of the rubber. If its cracked and dry, it might be time for a change.And, of course, look at the tread depth. The legal limit in the UK and Ireland is .mm, and one of the easiest ways to tellyour tyres are within this is with a p coin. Simply insert the coin into the tread groovesthe outer band of the coin is obscured by tyre, then youre within the limit. If you can see the band, the tyres need replacing.Wed check the tyre pressures too. Most garages have air compressors to top up air . Check the required pressure for your tyres by consulting your cars handbook or on the instruction  inside the fuel filler cap. Adjust your pressures accordingly and not only will your tyres perform more effectively, but itll save you money in fuel, too.OilOil is crucial to the smooth running and operation of your cars engine. Without it, youre in for a whole heap of trouble. Its why ensuring your cars oil levels are correct is so important, as without a proper amount, theres the potential for a lot of damage to take place. Yet despite being so crucial, its simple to check. Simply wait for the engine to coolits been running, and find the dipstick within the engine bay. Its often highlighted with a yellow handle, butyoure struggling to find it, consult the cars handbook.Then, once found, pull out the dipstick and clean it with a rag or paper towel. Re-insert it into the engine and take it out once more now, youll be able to see the level of oil in the engine via the dipsticks markers.If its too low, add more oil. Only do a bit at a time, and repeat the dipstick process each time - you dont want to overfill it.Windscreen washer fluidParticularly during the summer months when theres more dust and insects on the road, making sure youve got enough windscreen washer fluid is important. Much like oil, its dangerous to run out of, but easy to check. Again, look under the bonnet, this time for a blue cap. If the levels are low, simply top up with the correct washer fluid. Avoid using just water.CoolantCoolant is integral to keeping your cars engine at the correct temperature. During summer this is very important, but its just as key during colder months too. Though its unlikely that your coolant levels will have dropped, its always worthwhile checking the tank - again, this is typically found under the bonnet. Only ever use the manufacturers recommended coolant to top up the systemits low.FuelIt might sound simple, but ensuring that youve got plenty of fuel in the tank in readiness for a long journey can easily slip peoples minds. In fact, plenty of drivers undertake a trip and forget to fill up, resulting in a fair amount of stress during travel.Before you set off, check your fuel gauge and ensure youve got enough to get you to your destination. If not, its worth filling up closer to home, where you know the location of filling stations. Leaving it until later could result in the stressful situation of having to find a fuel station in an unfamiliar area.LightsLights can be an aspect of a car which are easily forgotten during the lighter months when the days are longer and the nights shorter. However,youre making a longer trip, theres a good chance that youll be driving in darkness as you near your destination, which makes fully working lights crucial.Check that your headlights and indicators are working up front, and test the rear lights and brake lights too. Wed give the hazards a test for good measure too - you never know when you might need them."},{"url":null,"title":"demand-pick-best","story":"Well Barely a week goes by without some fitness expert singing the praises of a new diet, skincare regimen, or a cure for whatever ails us, from sleepless nights to other more embarrassing issues. \"If only there was a series that investigated controversial wellness fads,\" you may sigh.

The soap that first aired in February  stayed in business for another decade under the shortened name of High Road.It is now enjoying a revival on STV Player, where viewing figures are nudging the million mark.The George Square showdown features in Scotland Loves High Road, a half hour documentary airing tomorrow to mark the showrsquos th birthday.Presented by Emma Cameron, it is everything you ever wanted to know, and more, about the soap that gave the world both Mrs Mack and Alan Cumming.Standing by the loch in ldquothe quiet and beautul village of Lusswhich doubled as the fictional Glendarroch, Cameron raced through the early years, tracing High Roadrsquos origins to an earlier soap, Garnock Way.Set in a mining village between Glasgow and Edinburgh, Garnock Way was deemed too gritty for early evening viewing and ended after three years. The supporting clip duly confirmed its sarky miserabilism. ldquoOh, yer home, eh  says father to son. ldquoNaw, itrsquos ma ghost, son sneers.STV wanted something cheerier, so they opted for a drama that would take all the cliches about Scotland and squeeze them dry.Take the High Road would be the lid of a shortbread tin come to le. If that makes it sound like a bad acid trip or a flu dream, sometimes, as we saw from the clips, it was.Alan Cumming, beaming in from his home in America, recalled his mid s days as Jim Hunter, evil forestry worker. Besides nicking money, Hunter stole the heart of a local woman, Carol, and she fell pregnant.Luring her to the woods, Hunter , chopped down a tree to fall on her ldquoof course.Like some Caledonian Rasputin she still wasnrsquot dead, so he strangled her. Half way through the killing, Carol regained perfect composure, and her voice, to tell Hunter she wasnrsquot pregnant after all. Now thatrsquos soap opera value for money.The future star of The Good We and X-Men also recalled a night in a Byres Road pub when a fellow customer askedhe was ldquothat guy who killed the wee lassie. Cummings said he was. ldquoThe place cleared, he laughed.Among the other High Road actors taking a hike through memory glen was John Stahl, who played Tom \"Inverdarroch\" Kerr from -. As the Game of Thrones star said, High Road touched on serious topics such as mental illness.But it was the froth, Mrs Mack being a busybody, the endless number of affairs, the daft fights, that came to define the show.At the height of its popularity in  the show had . million viewers ndash including the Queen, who once visited the set ndash and was shown across the UK, Ireland, Canada, the US, New Zealand and Australia. As Cameron said, the makers may have been playing to the stereotype, but they were right.The section on the early years was fun, with memories of a charabanc leaving the west end of Glasgowevery day for the -minute run to Luss. One of the villagers recalled how the vegetables on display outside the fictional local shop would be handed out free after filming had finished for the day. Oh, STV ambassadors, you really spoiled those locals.More could have been made of the showrsquos legacy. It was not just Cumming, James Cosmo and a few others who got their breaks in High Road. A generation of directors, camera operators, sound technicians, writers, the whole kit and caboodle of a regular programme, learned their craft in Luss, and would have had a tale or ten to tell.By far the highlight of the programme were the bloopers at the end. I would have been quite happythis had been the whole show. After all, nothing says High Road like flatulent horses and corpsing Scots actors.A  year run,  plus episodes, and a new le on the STV Player is not a bad sht for one wee soap to put in.

My ego draws me each year to the Catriona iety. We are a strong grower with high yield, blue and oval with a light yellow flesh and excellent flavour.There are no Catrionas this year and I am popped. It is February and, unruffled about the news of some virus from somewhere , we merrily eye the seed potatoes, pick up some shallots and some onion ieties for the allotment. At the seed swap table packets are switched with some excitement. Its not my allotment, its the allotment of the potatoes-are-treasure pal, but I love potato day because I love time in the company of people who have passion for not obviously passionate things.There is a tatty bash - a competition to chit and grow a potato in a bucket. The heaviest yield wins. I love to win so pay my donation and take my bucket.At home I pop my new friend in an egg box and stick her in a corner of the kitchen. Then work becomes very busy because suddenly everyone is very ruffled about a virus from somewhere  that is now here.By late March we are locked down and I am looking for things to do at home that arent Netflix or housework.I remember the, by now, lumpen alien thing in the corner of the kitchen. Green little sprouts have formed from the smooth surface of the misshapen brown egg and I decide to plant her in the bucket and see what comes next.Having lived my le in flats, my grandmothers garden was really the only chance I had to see how things were grown and tended. She had a rhubarb patch in the back garden and rose bushes in the front. There was always mint growing and she took great pride in the lilac trees that lined the back fence.I regularly drive past my grans house and was livid recently to see that the new owners have chopped down the lilacs, decades of care thoughtlessly felled.In my flat, now, I have three pot plants but a potato was uncharted territory. Very rapidly a pointy green nose began to poke from the top of the soil. My morning routine now revolved around a peek into the bucket to see what was happening next. A morning cuppa became a pot so there was enough to share with Tater.And yes, I know the tea thing is an old wives tale but those of us living alone in lockdown must take our comforts where we can.The speed at which Tater shot forth from the soil was quite something, I could almost see her growing.Unassuming, an under appreciated staple, the potato alleviated famine in Europe, changed the course of modern agriculture and is credited for the rise of the west. Impressed by their blossoms, Marie Antoinette is said to have worn them in her hair while Louis XVI threaded them through his buttonhole.I have eaten potatoes in the Andes mountains in Peru, where the tuber originated. I have driven over the Hoover Dam in an Idaho plate vehicle displaying the state motto: Famous Potatoes. I have eaten a potato cooked in a h#ng# in New Zealand.Yet here in a bucket in my living room is my favourite spud so far.Im worried Tater isnt getting enough sunlight but Im also afraid someone might interfereI leave her outside unattended. With heart heavy at the loss of our shared morning cuppa, I take the bucket and the fast growing contents to the allotment where the fresh air and sunshine sends her star-shaped leaves shooting into a constellation of dense green.Of course, being regularly at the allotment, it would be rude not to make myself useful. Suddenly Im weeding, planting runner beans and onions, tucking zucchini plants into compost.I am itching each day to get to the plot to see how my garlic cloves are growing and check on Tater. Truly you never know where le will lead you.Its amazing to me that no one has invented see through soil. This is torture, knowing all the good stuff is happening underground and we cant see it. Whats in the bucket  How many tubers are down there This must be what pregnancy is like: some outward signs of new le flourishing but all the best bits happening out of sight.Finally Taters leaves are turning yellow and her stalks spilling over the edge of the bucket. It is her time.\"Its like digging for buried treasure,\" I say as I wriggle the soil around. Well. My careful ministrations have resulted in... are you ready...  potatoes.I send a photograph to my friend. \"Very impressive,\" he replies, \"Not award winning but very good.\" Not award winning  I have an absorbing new hobby and its edible.

Hanan and her family were captured by IS as they fled on foot, carrying their belongings.In the years that followed, the Yezidi community was subjected to what the UN has called a genocide. Yezidi men were summarily killed. Women and girls were subjected to sexual violence, including sexual slavery, and other crimes under international law. Boys were indoctrinated and forced to fight for IS.I spoke to Hanan ndash and other Yezidi women forcibly separated from their children born of sexual violence ndash for an Amnesty International report, Legacy of Terror: The Plight of Yezidi Child Survivors of ISIS.During captivity, Hanan was repeatedly raped by the IS fighter who took her as a ldquoslave, and gave birth to her daughter, Fadia. Hanan suffered four years of violence, starvation, and fear. It was Fadiarsquos love that kept her alive.She told me: ldquoWhenever I was crying, she would tell me to keep my cries inside my heart, and this kept me stronger. Fadia was amazing.When Hanan finally reached refugee a camp in Syria, she did not identy herself as Yezidi for fear of being forced to abandon Fadia. She knew the reality: children born to Yezidi women as a result of sexual violence have largely been denied a place in their mothersrsquo community, due to religious and societal pressures. Some Yezidi women willingly separated from their children, many remain anonymous in refugee camps, others stayed with their IS captors, to avoid being separated from their children. Others have been forcibly separated from their children.Hanan was identied as Yezidi, dragged to camp authorities and sent to a ldquosafe house. Her family pressured her to leave Fadia in an orphanage, on what they assured her was a short-term basis, telling her she could visit whenever she liked while arrangements were made to bring Fadia to Iraq.But when she reunited with her uncle in Iraq, he told her: ldquoForget your daughter.Since then, Hanan has been cut off from Fadia and has had no updates for months.Hanan is not alone. Other heartbroken mothers told me their situation is unbearable. Several women have attempted suicide.Hanan explained: ldquoWe donrsquot sleep. We call each other very late at night, and we cry for each other. We wish we were dead or anywhere , not slowly dying every day as we are now.The international community and national authorities must urgently act to reunite Yezidi women with their children born of sexual violence, when that is their preference, and prioritise relocation to countries where they can live together in safety. As Hanan told me: ldquoWe cannot stand it anymore. Our children are a part of us. We are human, we have our rights, and we want our children to be with ushellip I need my daughter.

Independenceis a prerequisite for so many desirable changes.Mary McCabe, Glasgow G.MARK Smith concludes that by concentrating on combating the pandemic, Nicola Sturgeon has a strategy that has made both independence and her party more popular. This is a two-fold issue. The first is that polling had independence rising in popularity before the pandemic struck. The second might bolster Mr Smiths case, but as a mirror image.It is British nationalists who have continued to push the constitution as their main concern in Scotland, with a parade of little-known politicians now wandering round our country, eulogising the virtues of a Union, even while forcefully removing Scotland out of another union that had all the positives they extol. That might go some way to explaining their unpopularity in this country. We will have an election in , where British nationalism will be represented by two politicians, one who will be a peer by then and one still an MP, both of whom refuse to consider that Scots should have a say in their own future. Their policy will be apparently guided by an Australian who is being invited into interfering in the Scottish democratic process. Mr Smith should see this as a problem of British, not Scottish nationalism, because that is what it is.GR Weir, Ochiltree.ANDY Maciverproposing the formation of a new Scottish political party talks a lot about social democracy and social democratic ideology but signally fails to attempt a definition of what these old, hackneyed phrases actually mean. If we can infer that he means a free market system tempered by light-touch state interference in social and economic affairs he has to explain why, in the two biggest crises of this century, the financial collapse of  and the current pandemic, social democratic models have been set aside in favour of massive state assistance and bail-outs.I am certain that many of the New Labour politicians who oversaw economic meltdown and shameful wars in the first decade of the century would have happily understood themselves as \"social democrats\". This shameful record may explain why the Scottish urban working class, as Mr Maciver describes it, has deserted Labour.Reading Mr Macivers article closely gives a further clue to his thinking, politics as a career, not politics based on deeply held principles, this all too often has been a trait of \"social democratic\" politicians.Brian Harvey, Hamilton."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11661629.jpg?type=article-full","title":"union-lodges-two-safety-grievances-two-scots-councils-pupils-return-school","story":"EIS has said it lodged its safety concerns with Scottish Borders Council and Moray Council which it said failed to allow phased s of pupils and failed to properly consult and reach agreement with it and other unions.Lack of discussion around using the flexibility of a phasedmeant that staff are under \"intense pressure \"over schools reopening.It comes after a poll of nearly , teachers in Scotland outlined serious safety concerns in advance of primary and secondary schools beginning a phased re-opening from yesterday.some .% have said they registered ying degrees of a lack of confidence over the ability to keep the required m distance in the classroom.Three in four have said they feel unsafe ing to school with the majority saying they feel uncomfortable teaching without social distancing between pupils.:New Covid safety fears as over % of Scots teachers are not confident over classroom social distancingEIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said: ldquoThe recent EIS national survey indicated majority support from members for industrial actionrequired, to ensure the safety of staff and pupils in our schools.

It was our first outing since February and we felt like bears emerging from a long hibernation. We received what I would describe as a wary welcome, which suited us well, since as travellers we were as tentative as the locals. We enjoyed the novelty of shopping in the places which were open, taking care to wear masks wherever required. All the coffee-and-cake establishments we were happy to visit were models of social distancing and sanitisation, which made us feel very comfortable. So were the grocery stores and the craft shops in which we spent money.We were \"wild camping\", using secluded nooks in which to overnight our vehicle and taking care to interfere with neither passage of traffic nor local amenity. The only trace of our passing might be a bent blade of grass in the morning.The reason I write is because of the patchiness of the provision of basic facilities for travellers. Many public toilets are still closed and so are many campsites, so the availability of sites to stock up on water and dispose of waste are severely limited. As responsible travellers we found this a huge problem. Were we irresponsible travellers the temptation to chuck the rubbish over a hedge or empty the waste into the sea would have been great.Wersquoll not be venturing north again with our motorhome until we are confident that more basic facilities are open or have been developed.

The teacher estimates: ldquo awarded without moderation, he said ldquo would have led to an increase in pass rates without precedent.Sothe methodology was so fair and robust, why was he over-ruling the independent SQA and allowing this unprecedented grade inflation to take place  Well, Mr Swinney had spoken to young people who felt ldquotheir future was being determined by statistical modelling. The credibility of exam grades was of secondary importance to ldquothe risk that people would lose faith in the system. Well, they certainly will now.But does anyone seriously think that the SQA actually marked down working class students because they were living in a deprived postcode  Of course not. The SQA anyway subjected its moderation regime to an Equalities Impact Assessment ndash as it is obliged to do ndash before it published them.Moderation by algorithm is a pretty blunt instrument and doesnt take account of inidual performance. But, as Mr Swinney says, it is very widely used. Capitulating to grade inflation of up to % may win political points in the short term, but it will store up big problems for the future.:John Swinneys SQA U-Turn: Seven things you need to knowEvery year, grade boundaries move up and down to ensure fairness and comparable outcomes. Tens of thousands of pupils have their exam results routinely moderated. The English equivalent of the SQA, Ofqual, uses a very similar ldquostandardisation model against which to correct scores which depart from the historical average.Englands pandemic moderation is, according to reports, even greater than ours ndash % of grades have been adjusted downwards from the estimates provided by teachers, against % in Scotland. We wont know the final figures until tomorrowwhen the English A level results are unveiled. But, strangely, there has not been anything like the controversy over moderation that we have seen here.The inconvenient truth is that the Scottish ldquopandemic cohort, as they are already being dubbed, has exchanged one unfairness for another. They may have got the grades they and their teachers wanted, but those grades will forever be tainted by the chaotic and unprincipled way in which they were awarded. Handed to them by an Education Secretary in panic mode who said he had no right to interfere in examination results.

It also features an array of memorabilia including gig posters, set lists and autographed material.Over the past couple of years Chris, , has painstakingly sourced images through social media, spending hours in the evenings scouring Facebook and Google.The collection includes shots of some of the biggest names of the era - David Bowie at the legendary Glasgow Apollo in , The Clash in  at Edinburghs Coasters and the Pixies at The Venue in Aberdeen in .But Chris also went to great s to feature towns and villages which he says are \"rarely mentioned in Scottish music history\".He said: \"I am a huge fan of The Cramps and The Fall - there is an infamous tour they did co-headlining in  and they played the Stagecoach Hotel in a wee village outside Dumfries on a Monday night.\"I looked into it as a venue - it was just off the M and it was a great stop-off point and a lot of great bands played there, like Simple Minds and The Pretenders.\"Theres a great story there. Thats what its all about. Everyone knows the Apollobut when you dig down, thats the nature of gig-going.\"He added: \"Some of the hardest pictures to source were places such as the Mars Bar and Zhivagos - thats where Simple Minds started playing their gigs. They achieved great success by playing every single toilet youd go in.\"Most of these places are gone. Thats why this has to be done now.\"Chris, who remembers gigs from his home town of Glasgow as well as Dundee, raised pound, through sponsors, donations and crowdfunding to finance the  page book, which goes on sale this week.He said he focused on the period from the s to s not just because of his own love of the music from that period, but also due to the availability of photographs from gigs.He said: ldquoI am interested in images and pictures and I felt I was too young for punk and I thought wouldnrsquot it be great to know what the atmosphere was like at these gigs.ldquoQuite early on I got a cracking group of punk period photographs, which is like the holy grail because nobody really took cameras to these things.ldquoItrsquos not like now when everybody photographs everything. Back then a lot of venues didnrsquot let you take cameras in, they would take them off you.ldquoIf it was Tfanyrsquos in Glasgow, or the Apollo for example, it was hard and risky to do. Itrsquos very hard to take photographs in a big venue like those places anyway ndash you really need to know what yoursquore doing.\"Bands and artists featured include David Bowie, The Clash, Motorhead, Ultravox and the Sex Pistols ndash who only made one appearance in Scotland.More than  venues in  locations are showcased in the book, including venues such as Clouds, Night Moves, Tfanys, the Apollo and Silver Thread alongside less familiar clubs like Splash One, Subterraneans, The International Hotel, The Onion Cellar, The Stagecoach, The Venue, Fat Sams and The Tamdhu.Chris said the main challenge had been raising the funds to print the book. Nearly  crowdfunded pre-orders and donations over three weeks in February this year helped reach the target.He added: \"I was staggered by the range and quality of the material available. I wanted to cover the whole of Scotland, to give a flavour of how things actually looked.\"Gig-going was a fundamental part of our social lives, democratic and affordable, and the friendships forged are enduring. Im sure fans will enjoy looking through the book, whether they were there at the time or perhaps younger music enthusiasts tired of their parents memories.\"Ian Rankin, who wrote the foreword for the publication, said: \"Chris has curated a treasure trove of concert memories from Scotlands rock music past.\"A trip down memory lane for many of us, its also an invaluable guide to a lost world of venues, bands, fashions and moments in time.\"Chris said music used to be more accessible to everyone. \"People could just pitch up and go to gigs. Things cost so much more these days.\"The other angle is that I love street fashion, what people actually looked like.The ones I like the most are the crowd shots where youre right in front - you not only see the band, you see the backdrop.

Stride Out For Scotland, the latest campaign comes as the Trust battles to recover from the Covid- lockdown, which saw paying trips to NTS locations reduced to zero and visitors limited to ldquofree to enter natural heritage properties.With the main opening Easter season completely missed, a five per cent dropoff in membership compounded the misery, leaving the charity in crisis with a pound million loss in essential income.To date, the call has brought in poundm, and the Trust said it was enormously grateful for the aid already received.It added that Stride Out For Scotland was directly inspired by Trust members and donors who have been out exploring landscapes, gardens and walks since lockdown.They have also offered to make donations to ensure the charity can continue to care for the land, or to raise funds through sponsored walks.Now it is hoped iconic attractions such as St Abbs Head, Crathes Castle Estate, Culzean Castle and the Falls of Glomach will further boost the recovery effort.Welcoming the development, Ali MacLeod, who is head of fundraising at NTS, said: ldquoWe wanted to inspire our supporters to explore and reconnect with the places they love and we protect and,they are able to, fundraise to help ensure their on-going care and conservation.The campaign encourages people to enjoy walks and trails across the country which are tailor-made for nature lovers of all ages and abilities.Places cared for by the Trust also take in spectacular scenery such as Munros, sea clftops, woodlands and waterfalls, as well as gentle paths and gardens.Those heading into the great outdoors may even spot one or more of Scotlandrsquos ldquobig five wildle species ndash the golden eagle, red deer, red squirrel, harbour seal and otter.ldquoWith our countryside

craving the restorative effects of fresh air and greenery and the Trust has plenty of that to go round.ldquoStride Out For Scotland will not only inspire people to enjoy the stunning places on their doorsteps but will also help raise funds for our emergency appeal.She added: ldquoWhether yoursquore a novice hill walker, an experienced hiker or just looking for a fun family adventures, therersquos a walk to suit everyone.As well as routes, the National Trust for Scotland has published a downloadable walking pack, with participants able to share their pictures on social media using the hashtag #NTSSOS.NTS leaders are also urging walkers and ramblers to ensure they adhere to strict Scottish Government guidelines on hand hygiene and social distancing during their visits.When the Trustrsquos coronavirus-related loss was calculated earlier this year, it was reported that  staff were told they were at risk of redundancy.The charity also said it would pause all projects and postpone the re-opening of some properties in a bid to save money.NTSrsquo fundraising campaign was launched on June  and has since secured international support, including donations from America.Scots actor Brian Cox is among those who have stepped in to lend a hand, recording a voice-over remotely from his home in New York.ldquoThe Trust has been blown away by the response of key supporters, members who have donated, and the wider public too, said Mark Bishop, of NTS, at the time.He added: ldquoThis shows there is a lot of support for the trust out there and many people who want to play their part in helping it continue its vital work to protect so much of what people love about Scotland.ldquoThe support for the appeal will help our charity to recover from the impact of the virus.For more

outweighed by a wider concern about children losing faith in the education system.Mr Swinney, who faces a no confidence motion at Holyrood tomorrow, today admitted he had made a U-turn, but claimed he had done so because of concern for pupils rather thanbecause he feared losing his job.He told BBC Radio Scotland: ldquoThe reflection that I made over the last seven days was that the approach that was taken, which was a perfectly fair model, which the SQA had put in place, emphasised heavily the importance of maintaining standards from previous years to this year.ldquoThe reflection that I came to, having listened to young people, was that we had to look at  dferently.:Opinion: Iain Macwhirter: All shall have prizes in the great exams U-turn ndash except John SwinneyldquoWe had to recognise that young people had had a signicant disruption to their lives because of Covid, and we should not emphasise the need to maintain standards, which is the direction I had given to the SQA back in March, but we should essentially respect the concerns and the impact of Covid on young people, and give young people the estimates that their teachers had given for them.ldquoThat was the reflection I made in the course of the last few days, having listened to young people, and gone to the Scottish Parliament to explain the change of mind I had come to.However the suggestion that the new grades reflect young peoplersquos experience with Covid does not square with the way the estimates were calculated.In its official guidance to teachers on how to produce estimates, the SQA did not include the impact of Covid as a factor.Teachers were told to produce ldquoa realistic evidence-based prediction of the candidatersquos final attainment in each course based on ldquodemonstrated and inferred attainment of the required skills, knowledge and understanding for National , Higher and Advanced Higher.It added: ldquoThe integrity of these estimates is critical, because they will provide the core element of the certication process.Scotlandrsquos largest teaching union, the EIS, also said teachers had been ldquoextremely diligent in making professional judgements on pupil estimates.Ms Sturgeon also said on Tuesday that there would be a persistent question about the credibility of this years grades.However she urged employers toaccept them given the \"truly unique\" context of the pandemic.She said: ldquoMaybe we just need to see  being more unique and just accept that it is unique.ldquoIf it is the case that some young peoplersquos teacher estimates are above what statistically they would have been predicted to get in an exam, not inidually, but statistically, then when you weight that against the not enormous disadvantage that young people have been served up as a result of Covid, then maybe wersquore just balancing that out a little bit.MSPs on Holyroodrsquos education committee are due to quiz SQA chief executive Fiona Robertson, a former adviser to Mr

adverse policy-making at dferent levels of government, which has been described as the lsquoGlasgow effect.rsquo: UK officially falls into recession for first time in  yearsThe report set out  policy

Many households are trying to find ways to save money, but itrsquos easier said than done.When yoursquore a parent there are so many demands on your time that sorting out your finances can seem like a luxury you can barely afford.But the thing is that most families,they look into their money situation, really can make savings or find new sources of income.For a start, you can switch to a cheaper energy supplier.

Thatrsquos on us as a society and we need to change the way we look at social security and other support: getting back to the first principles and perhaps even seeing it as a positive thing.After all, like the woman quoted above, most of us are just a few steps away from needing a bit of help.

Pamela Walker, NHSO ambulatory care manager has explained that services are gradually being remobilised, with the situation ing to normal, but there are limitations on the number of patients who could be operated on every day due to the additional COVID- restrictions. “We can now do four general anaesthetics every day ,# she said. #However, patients needing local anaesthetics are being fitted in around the general anaesthetics and this is reducing the number of those still waiting for a procedure increasing the number of procedures being safely undertaken.”The theatre Day Unit teams are also limited to doing surgeries linked to one discipline a day as space in the Day Unit is reduced from ten to six trolleys. This is because some of the space normally used for theatre Day Unit has been given over to the COVID ventilation unit which, is to remain in place for the foreseeable future.“But we are working through the lists and we are confident that all those waiting will be attended to,” Ms Walker added. “While some people might feel we have forgotten about them, this is not the case. The impact of COVID means there have been long delays.”Senior charge nurse, Diane Gray, said those coming for a general anaesthetic had to have a COVID test  days before their surgery, then shield with everyone in their household for  days, then have another COVID test the day before their operation.“We understand that not everyone wants to or can do this,# she said.#If a patient is waiting for elective surgery but they don’t want to shield for two weeks, they can let us know and we will contact them again when the guidance changes. It is important for them to know that they will not be prejudiced or moved to the bottom of the list.Both Ms Walker and Ms Gray said that the decision to have an elective procedure during this time rested with the patient. They understand that this is a very dficult time, that the situation is continually changing and that not everyone wants to come into a hospital environment.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These estimates, based on their work during the school year, were then submitted to a Scottish Qualications Authoritymoderation system which downgraded the results — on criteria including the historic performance of the school.This sparked a huge backlash from students and politicians.Orkney Islands Council’s executive director of education, leisure and housing James Wylie said he was “delighted” by Tuesday’s announcement, made by an under-fire education secretary John Swinney.He said: “The signicant and detailed work carried out by teaching staff and school managers was to an incredibly high standard, and I had every confidence in the approach and final outcome presented to the SQA.”The u-turn now means that teacher estimates will be reinstated, and there will be no need for any appeals process.In Orkney, the downgrading of awards totalled .The total number of exam entries at Kirkwall Grammar School was , across National s, Highers and Advance Highers. Out of those,  were downgraded by the SQA.At Stromness Academy, there was a total of  entries, and a reduction of  across National s, Highers and Advanced Highers. In total, around  estimates were raised by the SQA at both schools.With the small numbers at Junior High Schools, there were very few changes made by the SQA up or down on teacher estimates.Mr Swinney, who is now fighting to save his political career, has already conceded that they got it wrong, and said an independent review would take place to look at where lessons can be learned.The SQA will now reissue grades, based solely on teacher judgement. UCAS and other admission bodies will be informed of the new grades as soon as practical to allow for applications to college and university to be progressed.The headteachers of Stromness Academy and Kirkwall Grammar School, Jane Partridge and Don Hawkins both said they had full confidence in their teachers’ judgements to produce “well-considered” estimates.Mr Hawkins added: “The staff have gone above and beyond to ensure a considered and moderated set of results.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The council is also looking at ways to fill gaps in childcare provision for children under two and after school care for older children.The move is in tandem with schools and marks a signicant milestone in the Government’s “route map” out of lockdown as Scotland continues to make good progress in suppressing COVID-.OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing James Wylie said the focus is very much “getting it right for every child” in ing to these services after a challenging period of many months.“The decision to close Early Learning and Childcaresettings has had an impact on the lives of children and families throughout Orkney,# Mr Wylie explained.#There was little time to prepare, or scope to explain, the changes to our youngest children. Their relationships and friendships were abruptly interrupted as well as their learning.“Our focus must be on supporting children when they are in settings, to form a secure and emotionally resilient attachment base which will stand them in good stead as they grow and develop.  Nurturing and attached relationships are essential to creating the conditions for children to flourish in early learning and childcare.“All children have a right to play, to learn and to access experiences that meet their physical, social, emotional and cultural needs, and they have a right to associate with their peers. The health and wellbeing of children and adults is vital and these important rights and considerations have all been factored into the development of a framework for reopening and delivering ELC services.“We now know that young children are less likely to be affected by or transmit the virus. This means we are able to reduce some of the restrictions on ELC delivery laid out in previous guidance. However, we cannot yetto normal ELC practice – we all need to ensure that we continue to manage services and mitigate risks.”Mr Wylie pointed out that every child will have dferent levels of required support. He explained that some children have additional support needs and it will be important as part of the risk assessments carried out to consider the inidual needs of a child. Where there is a need to work in close proximity with adults and children the appropriate safety measures should be put in place based on that risk assessment.There will be a short transitional period for introducing our youngest children back into their learning and childcare services this week and this will y within each setting. The aim is to have all children, where possible, back into their settings by August .In line with government advice, there will be no requirement for physical distancing between children in nurseries. In nurseries two metre distancing will not apply between adults and children as, this does not meet young children’s social and emotional needs. However, adults will need to stay two metres apart wherever possible.Similarly, no PPE is required when undertaking routine educational activities. However, staff will continue to follow existing guidance on PPEit is required. Enhanced hygiene measures will be undertaken where necessary.Anyone showing symptoms of COVID- should not attend the childcare setting.A list of FAQs has been compiled to assist all as settings reopen their doors — they can be found here www.orkney.gov.uk CV-EL-FAQcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As a result, some customers in Edinburgh and a small number of other locations in Scotland may be unable to connect to the internet. Engineers are doing everything they can to restore any affected customers as soon as possible. Due to the extent of the damage, we expect engineers to complete their work in the exchanges later today, Wednesday, – at which point we’ll be able to assess any further related impact. Most phone and mobile services are not affected and we’re very sorry for any inconvenience.”As far as power supplies are concerned, a SSE spokesperson said: #We have no reports of faults overnight in Orkney, but we currently have a power cut in the North Ronaldsay area which is affecting five customers and is likely weather related. Engineers have been dispatched to fix the fault.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system. By contrast, for the least deprived pupils, the predicted . per cent for A-C grades was lowered to . per cent.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that it would not be “credible” to have accepted the high pass rates as recommended by teachers.The First Minister and education secretary John Swinney both urged pupils to appealthey feel they have been treated unfairly.Both Highland Council and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar have said overall pass rates in the region were up on the previous year"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Shieling-on-Barvas-River-I-F-Grant-Collection-Edinburgh-Central-Library-2-scaled.jpg","title":"digging where we stand memories from the airigh shieling for a post covid new","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineOur hyper-globalised, high-octane way of le was stopped in its tracks in a matter of weeks, and many of us found ourselves confined to our local communities, with a great deal of spare time on our hands.The TaD team have – fortunately – been able to continue working from home, and over these past few months I have been lucky enough to have conversations with some of our contributors and their families, speaking about recordings from the past, but naturally reflecting on those times and comparing them with the situation we find ourselves in today.One conversation of note was with a relative of a contributor who was recorded in the early s., the ethnologist and previous TaD columnist, Mairi MacFadyen, referred to Alastair McIntosh’s idea that we should ‘dig where we stand’ in order to find meaning and to regain a ‘sense of place’.Mairi then explains: “The idea is that by researching and learning about our own history and the place we are living, we – as iniduals and as groups – can regain some control over the understanding of our lives and our inter-connectedness..”, or the shieling. – the seasonal moving of livestock and people, still practiced today in many parts of the world including the mountainous regions of Norway, Alpine and sub-Alpine Europe, and the Pyrenees.In the Highlands, the practice was widespread until the early to mid-th century when much of the moorland on which the communites had their shielings were claimed by the landowners and used for sheep runs, and for hunting., where the contributors are well aware of the custom of going to the shieling in their parents’ and grandparents’ generation... # of the sheep.Historically, this allowed the unenclosed crops in the township to grow undisturbed, and it allowed the livestock to take advantage of the superior seasonal grazing on the hills.. – the first day of may.The flitting took a lot of effort, but it was also a time full of excitement, for man and beast:., including cats for hunting the rats, but according to Donald MacDonald, dogs were not taken to the àirigh.On the first day the men would prepare the shieling huts, and the women would prepare a meal for everyone who had helped with the move, before leaving the children and younger women once everything was prepared.In Lewis the people stayed at the àirigh until the beginning of August., and they would come home at the weekends to go to church, often bringing fresh milk with them.. recited here in  by the Rev.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing! The colour and vibrancy has helped to lighten the mood of everybody in the village and those travelling through it.When in the area look out for the horse and all the displays andyou want to learn more about the work of the Cullybackey Community Partnership, ring Joanne on .

After the devastation caused by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, , British and Commonwealth troops were posted to Japan to help support the US occupation and reconstruction effort.Among them was Tom Clarke from Ballymena and his daughter Sandra gave theaccess to her collection of photographs of her father and spoke about his memories to mark this sombre anniversary.Sandra, who lives in the village of Lundin Links on the coast of Fe, still keeps in contact with her old friends locally via social media.“Dad was born to Joseph and Jeannie Clarke nee woodcock at Clonavon Place. “He must have been a character in his earky years because he ran away to Belfast at  to try and join the RAF, but he said they gave him a good kick in the backside and and sent him home,” laughs Sandra.SELECTIONEventually Tom met the selection criteria and joined the RAF, subsequently being posted as groundcrew to the Far East where he served in Burma, India and Japan. “My dad was fiercely, proud of his time in RAF. He valued the comradeship and the friends he made during times of hardship far away from home. “I suppose that’s why he took so much interest in the Burma Star Association in later years. He could talk with people who’d been out in the South East Asia theatre and who had experienced similar things.”When Tom was quizzed by his prooud daughter about his role in the war he often preferred to joke about his experiences.“I asked my dad how many planes he had shot down but I remember him saying the closest he got to flying, was laying in bottom of flat bellied boat going into Hong Kong harbour! “Lots of servicemen ended up with bad illnesses out in the Far East and Dad was no exception.“I remember him telling me how he suddenly took sick in the street. He had to throw up and it was then that his  teeth came out and fell into the stream of filthy water which was running down the alley.“He had to chase after them and give them a rinse off - he was never going to get replacments in India during the war!” But it was in the immediate aftermath of the conflict that Tom became one of a very small number of British servicemen to be posted to the Japanese mainland to help with the clean-up of the devastated cities.With the prospect of terrible losses in any military invasion of Japan, the decision had been taken to unleash the Atomic Bombs in a bid to force the Japanese into surrender. The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August  and , , respectively, with the consent of the United Kingdom. The two bombings killed between , and , people and remain the only uses of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.Tom received a medal for working in the zones but rarely talked about the more distressing experiences. “He would just say that the whole city had been wiped out. He - and no-one  - had ever seen anthing like it,” says Sandra. “You can only imagine the kind of things he saw.”In later years, Sandra remembers her father’s breathing problems.“My dad was a chronic asthmatic and I remember, after he died, a woman came to see me. They were trying to seethere was any link about ex-servicemen with chest problems and whether it was related to working in areas,that were contaminated after the bomb.“My dad had his normal medals then years later he got the Southeast Asia Medal and I believe he was was the only member in Ireland to hold it“As a wee girl about , I can remember people in the house, were discussing what they would like to inherit.“I wanted my dad’s medals. He was very proud of me taking an interest so he made it his job looking to see any medals he should have had. So he always used to phone me saying I’ve got you another medal - he actually got another  medals,which were commemorative only.”Sandra looked set to follow in her father’s footsteps but her initial attempt ended in failure!“ I asked at  for my dad to sign my papers to join WRAF, but he refused, only for me to join QARANC  years later.” Sandra’s memories of her father also revolve around musicianship.“I asked him one day what would you like to be remembered for and he said his love of music. “He played the trumpet all his le and was in the Silver Band with his brothers Joe and James and their cousins the Woodcocks.“He had a little dance band in the early s ,I remember them playing in the green hut down Harryville Park.”Footnote: Japan surrendered to the Allies on August , six days after the Soviet Unions declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki. The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on September  in Tokyo Bay, which effectively ended World War II.

It would be a stretch to say all of the administrative staff, all of the lecturers and all of the ious other employees are actively fighting against unionism, he wrote on Challenges NI, an online  for young voices in Northern Ireland.However, when unionists state that Queen#s University is a cold house for them, we are trying to discuss the Students# Union, its leadership and the general attitude of certain students around campus. These issues haven#t been addressed.I have sat on the Students# Council and I am constantly left in a state of bemusement at the attitudes. Mr Bell noted how the current Students# Union President, Grian Ni Dhaimhin, had posted on social media in the past expressing her apparent support for militant republicanism.He also claimed two other full-time officers of the Students# Union executive regularly show support for socialist republican activist group #Lasair Dhearg# via social media.Irish nationalist student councillors consistently put forward motions which are nothing but an insult to the unionist community on campus, he said.The latest example being a motion which attempts to ban the British military and PSNI from appearing on campus, a blatant insult to any student, regardless of political views, who intends to join the armed services or police upon graduating.There are #student bars# where unionists, and in particular Protestants, refuse to enter as they have a genuine fear of being the victim of sectarian abuse.In June members of Lasair Dhearg #renamed# Queen#s as #Mairead Farrell University Belfast# in a stunt to remember a former student who was shot dead in Gibraltar in  while engaged in IRA activity. Two other incidents that Queen#s Ogra Sinn Fein were engaged in have gone unpunished by the Students# Union, he added. During Freshers Fair , the Ogra Sinn Fein stand displayed a #Brits Out# sign. And Sinn Fein posters are consistently displayed on lampposts. Strictly speaking, these posters shouldn#t be erected outside election time and constitute littering because they do not have planning permission. These posters represent an attempt to mark territory.There are fewer ways to create a more unwelcoming atmosphere for unionists.Queen#s University as an institution might not be a cold house for unionism now but the Students# Union and attitudes on campus are certainly sending us head-on into an ice age.Queen#s University has been contacted for comment.

MLA Paula Bradshaw said the Health Committee wouldto the problems facing the industry as soon as Stormont ed.She said members had been “inundated” by dentists who feared for the viability of their practice.The Alliance representative added: “Given the guidance that you have to have that fallow hour, how do they sustain their dental nurses, their receptionists, their hygienist “I know that that’s up for review which hopefully will reduce the fallow period that will make dentistry much more viable.“There is movement and I think it’s been enough to halt any industrial action [and] it’s definitely something that we will be going back to very quickly.”A spokesperson for the Department of Health said PPE fees were set without their “involvement or knowledge”.But they said said health service dental care charges were governed.They went on: “Fees charged to patients for health service dental care are regulated and set out in the Statement of Dental Remuneration.“Dentists are not permitted to charge patients receiving health service dental care additional amounts for PPE. Should the Health and Social Care Board be made aware that health service patients are being charged in excess of the statutory charges, then the matter will be investigated.“In contrast, when dental treatment is provided privately, dentists are able to set their own fees and are able to request a supplement for PPE. These extra sums for private dental care are set by the practice themselves without any involvement or knowledge of the Department of Health.”Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fdee-ab-c-d-aaeebc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fdee-ab-c-d-aaeebc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fdee-ab-c-d-aaeebc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fdee-ab-c-d-aaeebc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fdee-ab-c-d-aaeebc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandThousands ‘could lose access to dental carebetter PPE not provided’Hundreds of thousands of patients will lose access to dental carebetter protective equipment is not provided by the NHS, a dentist in Northern Ireland said.Northern IrelandNI dentists urge Department of Health to cover cost of pricey PPE Health officials are being urged to consider reimbursing dentists here for the financial burden of purchasing better personal protective equipment. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ff--db-afbf-bbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ff--db-afbf-bbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ff--db-afbf-bbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ff--db-afbf-bbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ff--db-afbf-bbf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandCovid closure of NI dentists sees number of fillings procedures plungeThe number of dental filling procedures during lockdown plunged by , in Northern Ireland, NHS statistics showed.Most ReadGuess who#s not coming to dinner: Hard hit NI restaurants plagued by no showsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Robin Swann expresses #concern# about rising Covid- casesNorthern Ireland woman#s warning after man exposes himself to her in publicBest by a country mile: Loved-up Lisa McHugh#s mystery fiance revealedUnionist students face #dficult times# at Queen#s University ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

AnnaSophia Gallaghergrew up in Glenavy but has lived in the Lebanese capital for the last two years.Last Tuesday, she was sitting outside a restaurant with a friend around a mile away from the port where the huge blast took place.She said the heroic efforts of volunteers since then stand in stark contrast to shocking neglect by the authorities, with an angry backlash forcing the government to resign on Monday.It#s believed that over  people died in the explosion - caused by , tonnes of ammonium nitrate being stored unsafely in a warehouse for six years - with thousands more injured and displaced from their homes while the threat of coronavirus remains.Speaking to the Belfastshortly before a minute#s silence was held across Lebanon, AnnaSophia recalled the terrying moment of absolute, total destruction.I was sitting outside a restaurant with a friend who had just arrived. I was facing towards the port and it felt like slow motion, she said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe devastation in AnnaSophia’s neighbourhood after the explosion FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe devastation in AnnaSophia’s neighbourhood after the explosionWe felt the earth move like it was an earthquake and then I saw this huge gust of hot air coming towards us.The buildings seemed to inhale and almost exhale and just spat out all of the contents, all of the glass just fell out onto the street.Read More Massive blast destroyed our home, says NI mum Maxine Reid in BeirutThe sounds of cars screeching to a halt and screaming soon followed in the confusion.AnnaSophia had been sitting beside a concrete wall, saving her from the shards of glass that fell over others.She quickly contacted her family and co-workers across the city, who initially believed there had been multiple explosions due to the sheer scale of the blast.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe cafe table where AnnaSophia was sitting when the blast struck FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe cafe table where AnnaSophia was sitting when the blast struckA close friend of mine in Lebanon called me in panic, there were dead bodies where she was. She had fallen over at work and there was walking wounded in the street, people deeply injured, she said.Her whole apartment had been blown up, her dog had run away. She#s beside one of the main hospitals that was dealing with the Covid crisis.A nearby hospital soon became overwhelmed, with doctors treating patients in car parks and those with first aid trying to help.It was a complete disaster zone. The clean-up is just ongoing and the local solidarity is just amazing.She said faith in the authorities was now at rock bottom after the government stepped down.There#s yet to be a very clear government speech outlining the relief plan, the investigation, any clear factual help or response.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe table is blown into the street moments later FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe table is blown into the street moments laterSo everything has been done by civil society and ordinary iniduals. Obviously the international community has sent almost m, and they are here supporting civil society, and the UN are trying to coordinate that effort.She said the fact that the relief funds had not been channelled through the government spoke volumes.The absence of the state is remarkable. The international attention is very important to maintain the pressure to reform - whether or not those reforms will come and when and how is the bigger question.She said the arrival of foreign aid and finding her neighbour#s traumatised dog hiding under a bed in a dferent building had been among many emotional moments in the last week.One of the most poignant things was the night of the blast when I was sitting down having a short break.There was a man standing beside me and I asked himhe needed anything. He said, #I#m Syrian, we#re used to this# and my heart just broke like that. What world do we live in where someone is used to that  She added: Everyone is really taking care of each other and the solidarity among the people here is truly remarkable in the absence of any government solidarity with them.AnnaSophia works for a Northern Irish Lebanese company, Siren Associates, which works to make public institutions more accountable. Now working from home, she said the most pressing need is access to accommodation, healthcare and clean water.Meanwhile, work is continuing behind the scenes to form a new government after Prime Minister Hassan Diab resigned.Some of the main demands emerging in Lebanon are for an independent cabinet not backed by any political parties, and for an independent investigation into the port explosion.

The leaders faced calls to publish their own minutes from the virtual meeting.Later yesterday afternoon, the report on the website was changed, with the reference to Mrs Foster and Ms O’Neill’s comments on the Hong Kong situation having been removed.The new laws, imposed by Beijing at the end of June, have given the authorities more powers to clamp down on and punish pro-democracy protesters.They have been met with widespread international criticism amid claims the powers undermine free speech and curtail Hong Kong’s autonomy under the long-established “one country, two systems”.The story about the Stormont meeting with Madame Zhang had prompted calls for clarity.Amnesty International was among those urging the Executive to make public its own account of the meeting.Mrs Foster said she would be writing to Madame Zhang to voice disappointment. She said her position on Hong Kong was no dferent to the UK Government’s and that what she said at the meeting was “misrepresented”.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned the new laws as a violation of China’s treaty with the UK when Hong Kong was handed over in .The DUP leader tweeted: “My position on Hong Kong is the same as that of HMG.“The article in today’s press misrepresents what was said at our meeting with the Chinese consul general. I will be writing to Madame Zhang to underscore my disappointment.”Responding to the report, Ms O’Neill tweeted: “I made it very clear that I supported the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ international agreement.”Patrick Corrigan, from Amnesty, highlighted that the meeting happened days after images emerged that appeared to show hundreds of hooded Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province being transported from a train station.Mr Corrigan, Amnesty International UK’s Northern Ireland programme director, said: “The Chinese government says that Northern Ireland’s political leaders have endorsed their draconian actions in Hong Kong and remained silent about human rights violations in Xinjiang and where in China.“Surely this cannot be true.“If this is an accurate report of the meeting, then the First and Deputy First Minister have let down the people of Northern Ireland and betrayed the people of Hong Kong and the Uighur community in China. We need to hear a clear public condemnation from Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill of what the Chinese government is doing in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.”Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister also called for clarication.“In light of the appalling record of the Chinese government on human rights and disregard for the international agreement which is still binding in regard to Hong Kong such comments,accurate, would be inappropriate and I believe give an entirely inappropriate impression of how the people of Northern Ireland view what is currently taking place in Hong Kong,” he said.The Executive Office did not immediately move to publish a record of the call. A spokeswoman for the Stormont administration said the call involved a briefing by the consul general on the situation in Hong Kong.“The consulate’s report does not reflect ministers’ positions on Hong Kong security legislation, nor their comments at a recent courtesy meeting with the Chinese consul general,” she said.“As these matters are not devolved, ministers stated their awareness of the issues and their hope that the matter could be resolved.”Madame Zhang is also said to have spoken about Hong Kong’s national security legislation, claiming it does not undermine the region’s level of autonomy or its residents’ freedoms.Before it was amended, the report stated: “Foster and O’Neill thanked China for its valuable support for the fight against the epidemic in Northern Ireland. They said that the Northern Ireland government cherishes friendship with China, understands and respects Hong Kong’s national security legislation, and sincerely wishes Hong Kong more prosperity and stability.“Mutually beneficial cooperation in the fields of prevention and control, local cooperation, economy, trade and tourism will better benefit the people of both sides.”Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Robin Swann expresses #concern# about rising Covid- casesGuess who#s not coming to dinner: Hard hit NI restaurants plagued by no showsBest by a country mile: Loved-up Lisa McHugh#s mystery fiance revealedNorthern Ireland woman#s warning after man exposes himself to her in publicUnionist students face #dficult times# at Queen#s University ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In response, Prof. Dubras said: “We costed in to our business case the requirement for a capital build at Altnagelvin Hospital to determine the amount of money that would be required for that. “What our expectation is, is that we wish to work with the Trust and Queen’s University Belfastto have a building which serves everybody and I think it’s really important that this is not two universities, two buildings and duplication of everything. googletag.cmd.push “We’re not big enough to do that and it doesn’t provide good education, the only way that this will work well as we move forward is to have a provision which covers all undergraduate education and that enables post-grad activity to take place there. “That’s really important for students to see and work with foundation year doctors and doctors at other stages of their training so that what you have as a Trust is a culture of education and growing educational excellence in the area – and a single place, which is the hub, is where it needs to happen.” TENACITY Addressing the meeting on behalf of the Trust, Dr Catherine McDonnell expressed her admiration for Prof. Dubras’ ‘patience and tenacity’ over the past two years for ‘sticking with the project’ to deliver a medical school in the North West. She said it is ‘extremely important’ to the hospital in terms of stabilising the medical workforce and creating local jobs. To clear up some ‘confusion’ there may be about the nature of the medical school Prof. Dubras pointed out that it’s not a post-graduate medical school for people who are qualied as doctors and doing a master’s degree. She explained that this school will accept students who will be trained as doctors and their degree could have been in any subject as long as they achieved a :. It will be situated within the faculty of Le and Health Sciences. “The medical school is about supporting local young people and improving the economic potential of the region and tackling long-term social deprivation.” Work is ongoing to refurbish buildings at the Magee campus in readiness for students next year. Prof. Dubras said staff recruitment is an interesting area and people have already expressed an interest in coming to Derry to work. Chairman of the Western Trust board, Sam Pollock, said he believes the medical school will help attract staff to address the ongoing issue of agency costs. Director of Performance and Service Improvement, Mrs Teresa Molloy, said there has been extensive interest from partner organisations such as Fermanagh and Omagh Council about the long-term benefits it could bring. EARLY STAGE In , the Department of Health commissioned a Review of Medical School Places which recommended that Northern Ireland needs  more medical students a year to meet the increasing demand for doctors. At last weeks meeting Prof. Dubras pointed out how the medical school will start off with  students and discussions are continuing with The Executive Office to increase that to . Currently, approximately % of medical graduates in Northern Ireland tend to stay and live within  miles of Queen’s University Belfast after graduation, according to the GMC. The new School of Medicine at Magee will address departmental recommendations by providing access to medical education in the North West, positioning theDerryCity region as an attractive place to study and work. Students will benefit from access to clinical placements across the full range of general practice, medical and surgical specialities with primary care-based experience from week one. This will enable students to develop knowledge and appreciation of the interconnectivity between primary, secondary, social and community-based healthcare. A spokesperson for Ulster University confirmed: “Ulster University continues to engage with local partners including the Western Health and Social Care Trust on medical education. “Discussions around joint additional training sites are at a very early stage and no plans have yet been agreed.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The new centre will be moved a short distance to Anderson House at Altnagelvin. Derry was the first city to set-up a COVID centre back on March  at the out-of-hours Western Urgent Care building. The other Covid centre in the Western Trust area opened at South West Acute Hospital on March . The Trust continues to maintain a state of readiness for admissions of patients with suspected Covid- and a further surge. Speaking at the Western Trust’s monthly board meeting, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Chief Executive, said: “Both centres continue to operate, preparing for a potential second surge. googletag.cmd.push “The Altnagelvin centre will move to Anderson and South West centre will reduce its footprint to free up space in the outpatient department. “Movements are allowing us to recommence our outpatient services.” Antibody testing has been offered in the Trust area as of July , she told the Western Trust board. These tests are used to detect antibodies to the COVID- virus to seeyou have previously had the virus. The test works by taking a blood sample and testing for the presence of antibodies to seeyou have developed an immune response to the virus. A total of  tests were carried out and only  ed as positive, which Dr Kilgallen described as an ‘interesting find’. googletag.cmd.push A Covid swab testing service available to staff, patients pre-operatively and staff in the independent sector continues to operate at C-TRIC at Altnagelvin Hospital and Lackaboy in Enniskillen. However, those services are also relocating in August as part of reset plans. The latest NISRA statistics show that  people have died of Covid- in Derry City and Strabane. In the council area there have been  confirmed coronavirus cases –  in the last  days. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic a network of new Primary CareCovid- centres were then rapidly established to manage the growth of Coronavirus cases in the community. They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.  These centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of havingCovid- and require medical attention.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The start of the summer. A time of hope. A time of new beginnings. To celebrate my th birthday, my friends and I had travelled to Belfast on a minibus on a school-night in the middle of A Levels for that momentous YES concert. We were thrilled to get to see Ash and Bono at the Waterfront. We were extra ebullient at the sight of John Hume taking to the stage. The unlikely trio of David Trimble, John and Bono were applauded with yells of “Yesss!”. googletag.cmd.push  The burning pride deep inside on that night could have set the world alight. To the friends I had yet to meet, some of whom were at that concert, I would always be Proud Mary from Derry. I had come of age just in time to vote in the referendum three days later. Not all of us would have that privilege. My sister, Deirdre, who was singing and shouting her heart out for the entire excursion, was  months shy of voting age. In fact she would never get to vote as she was killed in a car accident we were involved in  months later. googletag.cmd.push I had meticulously studied the Good Friday Agreement text during the referendum campaign. As excited as I was to be on my way to Loch an Iuacuteir for Cuacutersa na Casca that Good Friday, my inner political nerd was sorry to be missing all the TV and radio coverage. No mobile phones or social media in those days. Just two days before the signing of the Agreement, I was at Stormont with a delegation of Derry Girls lobbying the British Government for a new school. I was on The Thornhill Talks Team with Mrs Boyle, Miss Hamilton and Head Girl, and my lelong friend, Emmylou. The eyes of the world were on these negotiations and the hand of history was on our shoulders. John Hume took time out to facilitate the meeting withMinister of Education, Tony Worthington MP. John was the architect of the unfolding momentous peace accord, but he was focussed on bread and butter constituency issues. He knew the importance of education in creating opportunities and building inclusive and peaceful communities. I was engaged in current affairs and local politics from a young age. I was fascinated by the work of my godfather, Uncle Mark. His job as John Hume’s parliamentary aide brought him to ious countries. He gted me with great stories and good lessons over the years. I proudly flaunted a “Hume for Europe” Tshirt in . I read newspapers. I listened intently to the kitchen wireless and followed the TV debates. Always rooting for John and rehearsing the Humespeak: You can’t eat a flag. Spill sweat, not blood. Respect ersity. An accident of birth. Dference is the essence of humanity. This language is now common parlance. John brought others on to his page and round to his way of thinking and speaking. It is impossible to consider John’s achievements without recognising the influence of his we and key adviser, Pat. On completion of my A Levels, I had the pleasure of working in the Bayview Terrace constituency office in the run up to the first Assembly elections. I learned so much about public service, not least in witnessing the compassion and care shown by Pat to every person. The office was buzzing. Phone calls were coming in from journalists, humanitarians and politicians from all over the world. I could hear John speaking in French on the phone one minute, then dealing with a constituent on a housing issue the next minute. Pat had time and warmth for everyone. Amidst the flurry, Pat still found time for banter and indulged my frivolous chats about nights out. I still regard Pat as a mentor and hero. I can only try and imagine the extent of sacrices made by Pat and her family over the years. After that short stint in the office, I spent three months working in Seagate , before starting my chapter at Queen’s and all the adventures that came with that and after that. The Omagh atrocity that summer was a stark reminder of the fragility of the hard-earned peace. John Hume was a political giant, a living legend and an international statesman. Above all, he was a Derry champion. He was a man of global thinking and local action. First-hand experience of poverty in his community motivated his relentless quest for social justice, and his role in founding the credit union movement was instrumental in giving opportunities to people and families. His civic leadership in the community was as impressive as his political leadership on the world stage. John Hume was a man of vision. Steadfast in his ambitions. Resolute in pursuit of solution. Willing to work with anyone. Determined not to be distracted by the viliers. He kept his shoulder to the wheel and his eyes on the prize. Not any of the acclaimed world prizes he won . Ultimately the prize for John was the prize for everyone: peace and the prospect of a brighter future. Those coming of age today face immense challenges as we emerge from a global health pandemic and enter a world recession. Climate emergency is real. In this part of the world we face the added challenges of Brexit uncertainty. Today’s generation need an injection of the hope that my generation were given  years ago. We still have much work to do. The “isolation of the West” remains a pertinent issue. The fight for a proper university presence in the city continues. “I sometimes wish it was that summer again…..” We should always maintain a little bit of that summer, even in the middle of the longest winters. The spirit of partnership and reconciliation underpinning the Good Friday Agreement and defining Hume’s pathway must be restored. And we shall overcome.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club have never tasted adult championship success. With the manner of victory over Glenullin on Sunday afternoon, it would suggest that consistency will be what Eamon Gibson will be looking from his squad during this condensed season. It leaves John Heaneys side with some soul-searching ahead of their clash with Limavady this weekend. From the way Ben McCarron careered through the Glenullin defence in the opening seconds, until the final whistle, they never looked like being reeled in. If anything, they shouldve won by more. If they are to stand up and be counted when the serious heat comes on, they will need a more ruthless streak in front of goal. The pleasing thing for them, they appear to have the raw materials. googletag.cmd.push They will have to take somewhat of a reality check. Glenullin didnt offer the threat many expected and showed signs of the form that found them in relegation trouble last year. It was a big ask for Michael Oacuteg McKeown in his first game in goals to replace the injured Pearse McNicholl and when they failed to secure possession at midfield, it was a long hour for him. Steelstowns runners through the middle hurt them and with Ben McCarron playing as a third midfielder, their mobile attack thrived in the space. Dermot OKane, one the best dead ball kickers in the county, was off colour and Eoin Bradleys relaxed  metre free coming off the post summed up a day they will want to forget. googletag.cmd.push Stephen Cleary played in the reserve game, but was forced off injured and  minutes into the senior game Eoghan Bradleys ankle injury saw him replaced. On came Rory Maguire who had while he had a terric game, he will be disappointed not to have bagged three further goals. Cahir McMonagle will be another option in attack, but its hard to imagine him getting the room he was afforded yesterday when the real action comes to town. Glenullin put Conor Rafferty onto Neil Forester in what seemed like a curtaining job, while Feargal Close pushed back on to Gareth Logue. It was Logie who dictated the game and even when Gerard OKane was sent out to mark him, the Steelstown mans movement caused Glenullin trouble. Steelstown were three points ahead when the first goal chance presented itself, but it fell to Glenullin. Dermot OKane picked out Paul Rafferty in front of goal but the low pile-driver was instinctively turned onto the bar by goalkeeper Marty Dunne. Seconds later Jacob Duffy had the ball over the bar at the other end. Brothers Dermot and Gerard OKane kicked two terric point, but it did little to stem Steelstowns incessant running game. Whoever is going to stop them, cant afford to drop off. They will need a half-forward line that will occupy them and top the overlap. When the first goal came, it was a majestic diagonal ball from full-back Shane OConnor who found Logue in space and his unstoppable shot went to the bottom corner of McKeowns net. Ryan Devine floated over a fine score from distance before Jacob Duffy made the second goal, with the strong-running Maguire blasting to the net. Steelstown missed three point chances before Maguire was blown up for over carrying when through on goal, almost ashe was caught in two minds to flick to the final support runner. Glenullin brought on three substitutes at the break. Brian Mullan was pulled out from goal with Eoin Bradley now stationed at full-forward. Early in the second-half he won a free but somehow spurned it from close range. He missed a chance in front of goal and the attacking unit didnt have the movement that would have tested Steelstown. At times Brian Mullan, who kept trying to push Glenullin forward, tried to float balls forward. The dference being was that the same space wasnt there that Gareth Logue made for the city men. The half took seven minutes to produce a first score. The move began with Dunnes monstrous kick over midfield, Rory Maguire was again involved and when the ball came from a Mark Foley, he was brilliantly denied by Eunan OKanes ing block, before Foley drilled over the . Then came a moment Gibson and his assistant Raymond Tracey wont be too happy with. Mark Foley had the ball at his feet in front of goal, with time to engineer a chance. He opted to lazily soccer the ball to Jacob Duffy who missed without working goalkeeper McKeown. On another day, this lack of urgency could be crucial. Ben McCarron and Darren McDaid, from opposite wings, floated over two sweet scores. And still the goal chances kept flooding in. After a neat move, McCarron and Jason McAleer created another opening but Maguires thundering shot hit the bar before spinning over. Maguire also brought out a fine save from goalkeeper McKeown who brilliant clawed the rebound clear, as the Steelstown attacks kept pouring forward. The chances Steelstown were mounting and missing had no bearing on the result. At the other end a fisted Eoin Bradley effort dropped into Dunnes arms and Conor Rafferty fired over when a goal was on, but it was always going to be Steelstowns day.

The fact he was man of the match in a dominant team tells enough about his performance. The finish for his goal combined power and accuracy to the bottom cover. With Ben McCarron playing further out, it was Logues running that made th Steelstown attack tick. MOMENT OF THE GAMEDUNNE SAVE – There were many scores in the game, but Marty Dunnes save was something . Dermot OKanes ball came in from the wing and Paul Rafferty just pulled on it along the ground and when the shot zipped off the turf, Dunne somehow got enough on the ball to prevent a goal that wouldve levelled the game in the thminute. TURNING POINTQUICK POINTS – While the first half goals gave Steelstown a , having Eoin Bradley lurking at full-forward meant they could not rest easy at the back. There were seven points between the teams with  minutes gone, but in the next five minutes Foley, McCarron, McDaid and McMonagle chipped in with scores to kill off the game.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lisa McGee was doing her A-Levels at Thornhill College when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in , and grew up knowing about Mr Humes work for the peace process. He was just there all the time, she recalled. There wasnt a time that you didnt know about him. There was never any debate about it, he was a good man. At a time where everything was debated about and talked about nobody ever questioned that. Not that you would ever have needed to, or have wanted to, question what he was doing. googletag.cmd.push Ms McGee said the news of Mr Humes death on Monday morning came as a shock, despite knowing that he had been ill for some time. He was a hero who walked among us, she said. I got really upset I was surprised at how emotional I felt. We were just so used to having him. It was phenomenal what he did, the influence he had and the amazing vision of what our future should be. Ms McGee believes hundreds of people owe their le to Mr Hume, due to his role in the cessation of violence. He was an incredible person and he was sent here for a reason, she said. googletag.cmd.push I was just thinking yesterday of all the people that may not be herehe hadnt been able to do what he did and built the peace process. When you think of everything he did and he never gave up- thank God. Ms McGee doesnt knowJohn Hume ever watched Derry Girls, but she hopes he would have approved. I dont knowhe ever saw it, but he and Pat knew I was a big fan, she said. I hope they thought it was alright. He was always in the background in the news, so he was present in the show. And Erin chats about him a lot in the Derry Girls book that I did recently. There would be no Derry Girls without John Hume because I wouldnt have had the opportunities that I had,” she added. The Derry writer that she wants her two young children to learn about John Hume as they grow up. There was an amazing image of him on the front of thetoday [Tuesday] and I want to get that framed for the house because its important that they know about him, she said. This was always going to be a very sad time because it was always going to be about looking back over the past and that was a very painful time in our history. It has been a sad thing for me that towards the end of his le he couldnt remember everything he achieved. Thats why we have to remember for him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, because of the coronavirus restrictions, an audience of only  people will be allowed into each performance. The auditorium at the Playhouse usually has room for  people. The producers of the new play, which has been written by Damian Gorman, want to fill the empty seats with items in memory of people who have passed away, either as a result of the Troubles or in other circumstances. googletag.cmd.push Mr Gorman said an empty chair was a very powerful symbol of loss and grief. “Somebody defined grief to me as love which has nowhere to go. Rather than having all these empty chairs that would be housing absence, we would be housing something of signicance,” he said. Kieran Grfiths, Producer Director of thePlayhouse, said they believed it was a fitting memorial for people who have passed away. “Like a low-laying fog, grief has sat amongst us all this year,” he said. “It’s grey, feels impossible to lt and kicking it sees it rise around us. “Our plan is to honour that grief and to fight through with resilience and creativity to simply try and make something move.” googletag.cmd.push As well as being performed live in front of a small audience, the play will also be broadcast live on the internet. Anyone who would like to donate an item for the empty seats at the upcoming show is asked to contact the Playhouse on .  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Chief Executive Paul Clancy has said the Northern Ireland Executive’s decision to make the wearing of face masks mandatory in shops is positive news because it protects both shoppers and staff. The decision also gives more certainty to businesses about the steps that need to be taken to keep people, including staff, safe. In a survey carried out with the Chamber’s members last week, % of  respondents supported the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops by the public. googletag.cmd.push Londonderry Chamber Chief Executive Paul Clancy said: “We are glad to see some certainty on this issue. A vast majority of our own members in the North West are supportive of the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops because they recognise that it protects the health and safety of their own staff, as well as customers. “The reality is that we will all have to make some changes to how we live, work, shop and socialise andthe wearing of face coverings is mandatory, it will help promote more of a cultural change in the acceptability of wearing face coverings. googletag.cmd.push “Shops in the city have put in place new measures and changes which will protect their customers and staff. Many retailers have invested a great deal of time and money to make people feel safe and secure and it is important that customers support the new guidelines. “This has been an enormous time of change, but we must all play our part to protect public health, keep the spread of coronavirus to a minimum and avoid a second wave which will be catastrophic for many businesses. “I hope that people will embrace this change and support local businesses as they try to navigate this new landscape. I would also urge members of the public to be mindful of shop staff and treat them with patience and respect. “The number one priority of retailers is the welfare and safety of their customers and staff and have taken these measures to protect everyone. By shopping local and staying local, we can support small businesses who have been impacted by the lockdown.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It has been developed as part of the UK Government’s Vaccine Taskforce, in partnership with the National Institute for Health Research , NHS Digital, and the Northern Ireland, Scottish and Welsh Governments. Dr Janice Bailie, Assistant Director, RD Division, Public Health Agency, said: “Health researchers are currently working to find a vaccine for COVID-, but without the help of members of the general public willing to participate in vaccine trials, this work will not be able to succeed. googletag.cmd.push “The NHS COVID- vaccine registry allows people to register their interest and be potentially contacted with an offer to participate in clinical studies. “You can sign up to give permission for researchers to contact you about taking part in COVID- vaccine studies.

This will help us to carry out studies and find a vaccine faster.” The registry is available to anyone aged  or over, living in the UK.

Cllr Kathleen McGurk, who helped instigate the initiative, said the cost of school unorm can be a problem for some families. “I firmly believe unorms are a hidden cost of education,” she said. “Branded blazers and jumpers can be extremely expensive and beyond the reach of some families, but they are mandatory in most schools and that leaves parents in a dficult situation.” A survey completed by the Irish League of Credit Unions found that % of parents found school costs a financial burden. googletag.cmd.push It indicated % of parents get into debt for back to school costs, while % of those have used payday or doorstep loan providers. Cllr McGurk added: “This program aims to help local families reduce the cost of purchasing unorms. “However, we are relying on the generosity of the local community to donate items of unorm which are in good condition and are no longer needed by their own family. “We would appeal to all families whose children have moved out of school, or outgrown items of unorm, to donate to the program at any on the drop off points advertised in social media.” googletag.cmd.push Once items are received and sorted, families will have an opportunity to book an appointment to pick up items they need at Benbradagh Community Support or Hands That Talk.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Of that number, the most popular setting for wearing a face covering was the supermarket, with % of respondents indicating they had worn their covering there. Petrol stations and local shops were the next highest on .%, with hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons close behind on .%.  Just % said they had worn a covering on public transport, where they have been compulsory since July , while .% of those who took part in the survey said they never wore one. googletag.cmd.push Asked to comment on face coverings, many of those opposed to wearing one said they didn’t feel it would have any impact on the spread of the virus. One respondent said: “I really dont think they are necessary. Wearing them is not effective. Hand washing  social distancing are the best preventative measures. Others felt the issue should be a matter of personal choice, with one respondent stating, ‘it should be a choice, not an order’. “If it’s not safe enough to go out without a face mask then its not safe enough to go out period. The number of people with ill-fitting masks is unbelievable,” said another. “Gaping holes, noses uncovered, constantly adjusting them with their hands are all defeating the purpose of the masks.”  Protecting the vulnerable was a motivator for many of those who were in favour of mandatory face coverings. “We should protect each other as best we can. Currently the advice is that face masks help prevent the spread of Covid-, so take responsibility and wear one,” said one respondent. Some also felt that coverings should have been mandatory since the start of lockdown, while others who are shielding said the lack of face coverings makes them anxious. “I dont see enough people wearing them coming out of shielding myself,” said one respondent. “I feel really unsafe and anxious about going into enclosed places as it is with my mask on so when people are not wearing them it concerns me and my safety.” As the requirement came into force yesterday, the NI Executive launched their ‘Wear One For Everyone’ campaign, stressing the move was to make things safer for everyone.  A joint statement said: “The use of face coverings is a vital defence in our battle against Covid-. “This is about looking after each other and doing everything we can to stay on top of this virus. It will help to save lives. “It also has to be remembered that some people cannot wear face coverings, due to a disability or health condition. “There should be no stigma attached to anyone in these circumstances. If those of us who can cover up do so, then it will help keep everyone safe. “We are confident most people will comply, but those who do not wear a face covering without a reasonable excuse risk being issued with a fixed penalty notice by the police.” Mid Ulster MLA, Emma Sheerin, said making face coverings mandatory was a positive step. “I welcome the move to make face coverings mandatory, and I think that we all should be doing whatever we can to minimise risks to ourselves and others,” she added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan OrsquoHiggins opened the scoring early on before Jerome Johnston and Marty Devlin replied for the Ulster champions.The industrious Paddy Sheridan levelled matters in the tenth minute with Martin McCourt giving the Magpies the slightest lead by the water break.Both sides continued to probe before half time with scores hard to come by. Miceal Rooney put Kilcoo two clear five minutes from the short whistle, while OrsquoHiggins scored a beauty right on half time to leave it - to - to Mickey Moranrsquos side.The lsquoFord got the best possible start to the second half with Conor Maginn and substitute Cathal Burns finding their range to put them ahead. It was tit for tat for the next phase of the game and with ten minutes left Kilcoo lead by one thanks to scores from Jerome Johnston, Paul Greenan and Conor Laverty.The games turning point came on the rd minute. A brilliant move involving Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Ryan Johnston and Miceal Rooney placed the ing Ceilum Doherty in and he palmed home from close range.The home side never gave in though and showed great resolve, Marc Reid even coming up to point from distance in what was a superb inidual score and one of the highlights of the game.But the Magpies held out, Doherty adding a good score to seal the three-point victory margin.Bryansford: Marc Reid , Stephen Toner, Ryan McDonald, Aaron McDonald, Timmy Hanna, Conor Maginn , Danny Savage , Fintan Canavan, Conor Devlin, Corey Laverty, Ryan OrsquoHiggins , Paddy Sheridan , Thomas McAnerney, David McKenna, Daniel McDonald.Subs used: Cathal Burns , Chris Clarke , Jack Maginn, Niall OrsquoHiggins, Lewis Casement.Cill Chua: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Ryan McEvoy, Tiernan Fettes, Miceal Rooney , Darryl Branagan, Eugene Branagan, Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Paul Greenan , Shealan Johnston, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty , Martin Devlin , Ryan Johnston, Niall McEvoy.Subs used:Ceilum Doherty , Felim McGreevy.Referee: Neil Cousins .Bryansford -Cill Chua -ACFL DIVISION A.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick.jpg","title":"Downpatrick motorists facing further disruption  ","story":"MOTORISTS are bracing themselves for five weeks of town centre disruption in Downpatrick.Work on a pound, sewer improvement scheme starts next week, with NI Water contractors focusing on key areas.They include New Bridge Street, Church Street, Bridge Street, Saul Street, Saul Road, Marian Park, Drumlin Park, Scotch Street, Market Street, Market Lane, Stream Street, Racecourse Hill, Ardglass Road, Edward Street, Knocknashinna Road and the Knockchree Road.A number of short lane closures are expected, with two-way traffic maintained at all locations using temporary traffic controls.Vehicular access for residents and businesses will also be maintained as far as possible but there may be some slight delays according to NI Water which has confirmed that pedestrian access will be available at all times. Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick Cricket.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the decision in early August.ldquoI proposed the initiative to encourage shoppers back into Downpatrick to provide a boost for our local businesses who have continued to provide key services during the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across the district and to review the car park tarf of p an hour, with a reduction in the hourly rate being considered.Cllr Sharvin said while shoppers will not have to pay to park for almost two more weeks, he has vowed to continue working with local businesses to ensure that the local authority is doing everything it can do to support them.He added: ldquoWith this feedback from local businesses, I would not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my opinion, was counter productive to the reason why councillors had agreed to the extended free parking to encourage people to shop locally and provide businesses with some breathing space to adapt to the new way of working.She also highlighted the need for the local authority to press ahead with its car parking strategy and for an equitable charging system across the

Hanna settled into the next bunch, finding his climbing legs quickly and reached the summit in fourth place over half a minute clear of Martin Dematteis.One of the best climbers in the field, Hanna continues to hone his descending skills too and he held on for a long time on the descent in fourth before being caught by Dematteis.However, he achieved a brilliant fth place finish, taking the scalp of the Aymonod, the winner the day before, and many other top runners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 United.jpg","title":"United front in drive to restore Downe services  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed the new united front in the campaign to restore key services to the Downe Hospital.Politicians, trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee worked alongside each other in lobbying the South Eastern Trust to restore emergency services at the Downpatrick hospital which is scheduled to happen on October .In a throwback to previous campaigns, all of the districtrsquos political parties and trade unions are now working alongside hospital campaigners to secure the future of the Downe and to argue for a range of new services.Campaigners say while they will be keeping a watching brief to ensure that the hospitalrsquos AE reopens in October as planned, they are also conscious of the ongoing province-wide review of urgent and emergency care.The review mdash commissioned by the Department of Health ndash aims to establish a new regional care model for Northern Ireland with any future proposals subject to public consultation.At a socially distanced meeting of the community health group in Killough last week, campaigners said that future proposals for the Downe arising out of the review could be crucial and potentially be the launchpad for a major new battleground.Confirmation of theof emergency services in October comes after it was revealed that over the past five years there has been a % increase in AE attendances at hospitals across Northern Ireland.Signicantly, Department of Health figures reveal that the biggest increase mdash .% mdash was at the Downe, with the number of patients increasing from , to ,.Health campaigners say the figure represents another ldquostrong, persuasive reason why they must continue to fight for a local emergency department which is valued and needed.They are delighted with the plannedof AE services, suggesting that with the fastest growing emergency department in Northern Ireland, there is a ldquostrong, logical statistical argument for not only retaining the service, but enhancing it.Health committee chairman Eamonn McGrady,revealed that analysis of increased attendances at emergency departments shows that the growth area is not Belfast, but at hospitals in the Southern , Northern , Westernand South Easternhealth trusts.He added: ldquoWe know we are not home until the Downersquos emergency department is reopened in October and and we will all be keeping a watching brief.Mrs Anne Trainor said she was ldquomore prepared than ever to work harder for the Downe as she will never be able to repay the debt of gratitude that she owes the hospital and its excellent staff for helping her ill husband.She also described a recent meeting with senior officials from the South Eastern Trust to discuss theof emergency services to the Downpatrick hospital as ldquorobust and revealed she was left perplexed when health minister Robin Swann said health officials would ldquoexplore the feasibility of reopening the department.ldquoThis particular service has been part of the Downe Hospital for years. Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness. Itrsquos said that lsquounited we stand, ided we fallrsquo but we have no intention of falling anytime soon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11687266.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...Yet, now, almost  years after Europe was developing and enshrining such basic freedoms, China has none of them. Beijing oppresses Uighur and Christian minorities and denies basic rights to all its citizens. Something as elementary in the West as voting to choose your political leaders is unthinkable, as is a free media or web. China is not the world’s most brutal dictatorship but is the largest and richest one — a global stain on st century values. You cannot criticise, or find out, what the government does. The  Tiananmen massacre of hundreds of students at reform protests cannot even be commemorated, because it has been erased from history. The country is also increasingly aggressive militarily outside of its borders.Lately, Beijing has both been secretive about the origins of the Covid outbreak within its territory, and has used the pandemic to tighten its grip on Hong Kong. Anyone who has read or watched the news in recent years knows the threat to its western freedoms was a scandal even before the national security law. Irish nationalists cite British misconduct over the centuries, but the fair minded among them will accept that China is repressive in ways Britain has never been. Irish republicans campaign against Israel. Why not against communist China  Unionists ought to be horried that British-installed democracy in Hong Kong is being dismantled.Northern Ireland’s two communities should easily be able to agree on Hong Kong. Beijing will do what it wants, regardless of Stormont, but our joint leaders would be betraying Hong Kongthey gave China even the vaguest sense that what they are doing in the city is OK. After reports that Michelle O’Neill and Arlene Foster did at least that, Ms O’Neill put out a feeble tweet about supporting China’s ‘two systems’ yesterday but did not address how Beijing is tearing that up that understanding. Mrs Foster said she backs the UK stance on Hong Kong, which is welcome. But this newspaper gave both leaders a chance to go further in their denunciation of what is happening, yet they declined that opportunity.• Northern Ireland’s leaders decline to condemn Hong Kong law after China claims they respect it• Hong Kong democracy supporters buy newspaper to support it after police raid ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...Minecraft is a game full of mystery to meAnd generally I leave it at that, surmising perhaps that his impatience is a symptom of youth and that a time will come in the future when he’s happy to sit with his silly old dad and watch a few balls being potted, or even a test match in cricket, or a rugby international.But this year something dferent occurs to me. When I was the age my boy is now I had already got my first miniature snooker table from Santa and played on it until the cloth was worn out.When I was the same age my boy is now I was deeply engrossed in the drama of watching Alex Higgins become world champion in .The conclusion is hard to avoid, my son is not interested in the things which occupy my thoughts. For him, the preferred leisure activities are an array of computer games, which are as much an impenetrable mystery to me as snooker is to him.And I feel a stab of regret at the realisation. The link which I so cherish refuses to form, the opportunity for shared experience is denied.I suppose there is a part of me which always looked forward to recounting to him the magnicence of Higgins’ achievement almost four decades ago.How, facing elimination in the semi final against a baby-faced Jimmy White, the Belfast man completed the greatest and gutsiest clearance in the history of the sport. How he potted a blue ball and then screwed the cue ball back to near the black spot in an act of motion which defied all the known laws of science. How a deeply flawed inidual, driven by a scowling intensity, performed a feat of courage and nerve which meant, in that moment, a game which should really mean nothing, seemed to mean everything. How those few moments were to define the man’s le’s work and character. There is no drug more powerful than nostalgia and I long to share what I experienced.But it is not to be. Instead I remain silent and nod along as my son breathlessly recounts to me his latest achievements in the game Minecraft, telling me over and over of a mysterious world of dragons, zombies and portals. Sometimes he sits beside me as he plays and I watch sport. So close together but moving in dferent directions.Then another latent memory stirs from somewhere deep. It is of my own father and his lelong fascination with machinery. How, when I was a little boy, so much of his time and thoughts were dominated with tractors and diggers. It was an obsession I was never to share or understand.I remember on New Year’s Day my da would always go to a ploughing match somewhere in rural County Antrim. Occasionally I would accompany him, trailing behind as my little wellies would get stuck in a muddy field. An array of brightly-coloured tractors moved earth up and down in straight lines while serious-faced men in flat caps watched and smoked. And throughout I would think about how alien and stuffy it all seemed.Sometimes we would travel to agricultural shows and my da would spend what seemed to be an age studying freshly painted machines and speaking to like-minded peers while my brothers and I would whine about wanting to go the playground.Now I consider that there may have been an inkling of what I am feeling now within my own father. A desire within him for his interests to overlap with mine, so he could pass on what he knew down through the generations. But I remained stubbornly resistant, preferring my own world of imagination, of writing stories, and of snooker, cricket and rugby. I consider how patient my da must have been to listen to that young boy waffling on for hours about sports that he never really cared about.Which brings me back to where I started, watching snooker while the rain patters the driveway outside. My son is beside me playing Minecraft. This time I try a dferent question.‘Hey buddy, what’s going on in your game ’He eyes me suspiciously at first.‘I’m trying to build a portal daddy, but I can’t get it to work. Can you help me ’I’m hesitant, because I know this is not my world. But I take the iPad and begin, for the first time, to study the game where landscapes are created out of square blocks. After a very long time I work out that my son has placed one block in the wrong direction, which prevents the portal from opening. I correct it and he yelps with delight.‘Thanks daddy! Now can you give me back the iPad ’He goes back to his game. I go back to my snooker. Our interests may dfer, but there is enough commonality to make the whole thing work. We don’t exchange many words in the next hour, but after a while he reaches across and puts his small hand into mine. We stay just like that.He sees the world in a dferent way than I do, just like I saw it dferently than my own da when I was a boy. Some day my son may develop some interest in sport and I’ll be able to pass on my memories of the legendary feats of Alex Higgins, although I now accept that it’s unlikely. After all I always remained stubbornly resistant to the charms of ploughing matches. But it’s ok, because it’s better that he digs his own furrow in le.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
