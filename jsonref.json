One claimed that he had to once wipe a \u0027substance\u0027 from the actor\u0027s face in a nightclub. It was also claimed that he spent the day \u0027smoking and drinking\u0027 on the set of City of Lies, formerly known as LAbyrinth, in which Depp plays a LAPD detective investigating the deaths of rappers Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur.             Possible explanation: Depp shaved his head and bleached his eyebrows to reprise his role as Grindewald in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. It wrapped filming in December and he has scarcely been seen since then . The film comes out in November           During his visit in Moscow, Depp also visited the Mayakovsky museum where, in one image, he looked happy and healthy as he posed with staff          A third image, taken in Moscow earlier in the week during a visit to a state museum, provoked more concern. Depp is pictured with one of the museum\u0027s staff The production wrapped filming last year and Depp was praised by some for his conduct on set including a handful of extras who said he \u0027couldn\u0027t have been nicer\u0027. It was however alleged that he asked a production staffer to punch him during one incident. According to sources cited by Page Six, Depp allegedly asked the staffer to punch him and said he would give him $100,000 to do so. His representatives did not comment at the time.             Depp is pictured in June, 2017, at Glastonbury festival in England when he had a full head of hair and fuller face           Depp is pictured with ex-wife Amber Heard in September, 2015.

A lot of them have lost family members.\u0027I was chatting to a guy who was driving one of the vans with supplies, he had lost four or five family members – uncles, aunties, cousins – but he was still helping out.\u0027He was fighting back tears while he was driving to the market to buy things.\u0027Mr Kerlin said he felt safe in Antigua, but added: \u0027I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s just naivety.\u0027While the volunteers\u0027 immediate efforts are focused on delivering essential supplies to those affected by the disaster, there are concerns for the long-term impact on the area.\u0027I don\u0027t think the villages will be the same again,\u0027 he said.                                                      Robbers flee on moped after robbery at Regent St jewellery shopIrate cyclist uses CAR HORN to clear pedestrians out of bike lanesTourist mugged by gang outside Magaluf rocksNightclub owner Peter Stringfellow dies from cancer at age of 77Hammer wielding gangs clash outside of a primary schoolTravellers wash their horses at the Appleby Horse FairNewborn baby is MIRACULOUSLY alive after being buried for 8 HOURSDavis says there is \u0027every reason\u0027 Brexit negotiations will succeedBritish grandmother may be deported from Perth within weeksAlligator lurks near boy playing outside with toy alligatorAstonishing moment bystanders chase moped gang on Regent Street\u0027She was my second mum\u0027: Heartbroken neighbour of Sophia KaczanA soldier rescues a girl from a hole in an area affected by the eruption of Fuego volcano in Escuintla, Guatemala  A rescue worker carries a flock of farm birds rescued from homes destroyed by the eruption in El Rodeo          Rescue workers carry injured pets and livestock to safety in the aftermath of the deadly eruption  Thick gray ash covering the stricken region was hardened by rainfall, making it even more difficult to dig through the mud, rocks and debris that reached to the rooftops of homes   Rain often forced teams to retreat for fear of mudslides and boiling water flowing down the volcano\u0027s slopes from dangerously hot volcanic gas and ash also posed a threat   Rescue operators said after 72 hours there was virtually no chance of finding anyone else alive           Volunteers are seen preparing food rations after Fuego volcano erupted in Alotenango, Guatemala, sparking new evacuationsIn past disasters in which authorities determined there was no chance of finding survivors and further efforts to recover bodies would be too difficult, areas have been declared burial sites, the final resting place of the victims.Asked about that possibility, the director of Guatemala\u0027s disaster agency, Sergio Cabanas, said: \u0027Not until the search efforts are over, and it would be left up to the people.\u0027 The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it released more than $253,446 from its global emergency fund to support frontline emergency efforts.These funds will help \u0027Guatemala Red Cross support 3,000 of the most vulnerable survivors for three months,\u0027 they added.In addition, the Mexican government said on Wednesday evening that it would send a team of medical specialists and, if necessary, transfer victims to hospitals in Mexico.The 3,763-meter (12,346-feet) Volcan de Fuego is one of several active volcanoes among 34 in the Central American country.

Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron talk during a bilateral meeting at the G7 Summit in 2017What is the G7 Summit?Every year, leaders of all G7 countries meet to discuss important issues that are affecting the world and policy agreements that are made at the G7 Summit ultimately have a trickle-down effect on countries around the world.The location of the G7 Summit changes between the nations that are represented by their member and the leader of the hosting nation hold the G7 Presidency for that ear. It is their responsibility to host and organise the annual event and set the agenda.Where is the G7 being held in 2018?In 2018, the G7 Summit will be held on June 8-9 2018 in Charlevoix, Quebec, Canada with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the G7 President this year.          Leaders of the G7 countries seen here attending a working meeting at the G7 summit in 2015What will be discussed at the G7 2018 Summit?For this year’s G7 Summit, Justin Trudeau has set up ministerial meetings on five topics:1. Advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment2. Investing in growth that works for everyone3. Preparing for jobs of the future4. Working together on climate change, oceans, and clean energy5. Building a more peaceful and secure worldThe first of these goals is even more so poignant after Trudeau referred to himself as a feminist leader and the subject of gender parity is expected to be a dominant theme, across all five discussion topics.Alongside this, with perceptions of the US have fallen after 15 women came forward accusing Trump of sexual harassment, in addition to what was heard on the Access Hollywood tape, Trudeau has set up a Gender Equality Advisory Council.          George W. Bush, John Major and James Baker pictured at the G7 summit, when held in LondonWhat is the Gender Equality Advisory Council?Dayle Haddon, one of the 19 who make up what is being dubbed ‘The Council’, mentioned that private sector accountability and more investment in technology will also be main talking points on both days, according to Notable Life. ‘If you’re not being represented, complete decisions can’t be made.‘In matters such as creating future jobs, we need help designing what that landscape looks like when gender parity is incorporated. If the majority of people working on future-shaping technologies like AI are male, what they are creating will have a male worldview, which only enforces the problem.‘We need growth that works for everyone, and to do that we need to increase girls’ education levels in the technology and AI industries so they have access to these new jobs of the future,’ she said.The aim of the Gender Equality Advisory Council is to call on private sector companies to step up and eradicate this problem and The Council will look to organisations to publicly commit to achieving a gender-neutral board, with equal pay and equal leadership by 2020.‘The leadership qualities that Prime Minister Trudeau is manifesting are extremely impressive. It’s like Canada is standing up,’ Haddon said.Mariah Carey\u0026#8217s All I Want For Christmas UK tour 2018 tickets, dates, venues and scheduleBrexit Secretary David Davis revealed after Theresa May adds 2022 \u0026#8216end date\u0026#8217 to Irish border plan Triple J\u0027s One Night Stand festival 2018: Everything you need to knowBeyonce and Jay-Z tour On The Run II launched in CardiffWhat is Kevin Durant\u0026#8217s net worth?

It was established back in 1954 by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands.The elite group takes its name from Hotel de Bilderberg in Oosterbeek, the Netherlands, where it held its inaugural meeting on May 29, 1954, at the behest of Prince Bernhard. The group’s initial aim was to revive transatlantic ties between Europe and North America, as the United States and Canada had prospered as Europe, recovering from World War II and faced with the Soviet Union on its doorstep, had seen a rise in anti-American sentiment.The Bilderberg Group’s early leaders deemed its meeting necessary to strengthen North American and European ties as Cold War tensions escalated rapidly.Over the years, the group’s main goal has evolved to promote free market Western capitalism. However, given the powerful nature of attendees and the fact that its secretive annual meetings are held under Chatham House Rules – meaning that participants are free to use any information gleaned to them but are unable to ulge the identity of the person or group who gave it to them – the group has become the subject of many conspiracy theories over the years.When is the Bilderberg Group conference 2018?The Bilderberg Group’s 2018 meeting will take place from June 7 to June 10.Where is the Bilderberg Group conference 2018?The 2018 Bilderberg Conference will be held in Turin, Italy.            IMF director Christine Lagarde has attended the Bilderberg Group meeting in years pastBilderberg Group membersThe Bilderberg Group’s annual meetings have traditionally drawn many of the most influential and powerful political and business leaders from all across North America and Europe.The annual conference is usually attended by roughly 120 to 150 people, with the 2018 meeting slated to include 131 attendees. Just a few of the reported attendees for this year include tech entrepreneur Pete Thiel, King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, Colorado Governor and possible 2020 U.S. presidential candidate John Hickenlooper and many others.Influential political and business leaders who’ve attended in years past include former U.S. President Bill Clinton, businessman and philanthropist Bill Gates and International Monetary Fund director Christine Lagarde.Bilderberg Group conference 2018 agendaThe rise of populism in Europe is at the top of the Bilderberg Group’s 2018 agenda, a development not at all surprising considering the recent success of populist political leaders across the continent and the United Kingdom’s Brexit vote in 2016.Socio-economic inequality, trade, artificial intelligence and the implications of the upcoming 2018 midterm elections in the United States are also high on the powerful group’s agenda for this year.According to the press release, the following items are currently on the meeting’s agenda in order of precedence:1. Populism in Europe2. The inequality challenge3. The future of work4. Artificial intelligence5. The U.S. before midterms6. Free trade7. U.S. world leadership8. Russia9. Quantum computing10. Saudi Arabia and Iran11. The “post-truth” world12.

The airfield was abandoned following the ceasefire of the 1974 war and today stands derelict. Nicosia, the Cypriot capital, was ided into a Greek south and Turkish north area after the brief but devastating war of 1974          Definitely a no-go area: Rolls of sharp barbed wire prevents entry into the main hall inside the decaying Nicosia International Airport. Closed since 1974, Nicosia was the island\u0027s primary airport. It is now abandoned and located in the UN-controlled Buffer Zone which separates the Turkish-occupied north from the south. The airport\u0027s crumbling walls, barbed wire and deserted airfield are a far cry from its heyday, as the gateway to sun-filled holidays in Cyprus          Parts of this plane appear to have been shot at, and scavenged, while the elements have clearly also taken a toll. This picture shows the rusting, discoloured exterior of the fuselage of an Cyprus Airways Trident passenger jet parked on the tarmac of the long-abandoned complex. Nicosia International Airport was used as the island’s principal airport. However it was initially a military air base, and underwent expansion during the Second World War          You\u0027d need more than a mop here: Bird droppings cover nearly every part of the passenger departure area in Nicosia, Cyprus, while in the ceiling above, light fixtures have become rusty because of the lack of maintenance over more than four decades. It\u0027s hard to believe it was once a beacon for holidaymakers, who once flocked to the airport before journeying to and from holiday destinations at stunning resorts nearby. Local wildlife, however, is obviously taking advantage of its abandonment          No passports needed: This office has been boarded up for over 40 years now, with just the sign about the doorway showing its former life as the official border control post. Speaking about the 1974 invasion, Captain Adamos Marneros was flying when he saw Turkish warships approaching the Mediterranean island in an invasion triggered by a coup by Greek Cypriots aiming to unite with Greece.  The pilot recalled he \u0027couldn\u0027t allow myself to be frightened\u0027 because he had to land the plane safely           The former main terminal at Nicosia International Airport stands decaying inside the buffer zone on the southern, Greek side of the ided city in Cyprus. Capt Marneros, who was then a 27-year-old pilot with national carrier Cyprus Airway, said he had deep misgivings about making the flight to Nicosia. After a sleepless night in his London hotel room watching TV reports of the buildup to invasion, he pleaded on three separate occasions with the airline\u0027s boss to cancel the flight - to no avail          Spooky too: The former arrivals hall in the main terminal at the airport also looks bare, with debris covering the floor, while an old sign can be seen with the word \u0027Yes\u0027 to the rear, near passport control. Recalling his flight\u0027s approach to the island in darkness, Capt Marneros saw the hulking silhouettes of warships \u0027creeping\u0027 toward Cypriot shores. His warnings to the airport control tower were met with what he said were halfhearted attempts to ease his concerns          A dilapidated plane, lies abandoned on the tarmac. Capt Marneros was among the last to leave the airport during an evacuation. As he left in his car, he caught sight of Turkish paratroopers just north of the airport drifting down from the skies. \u0027I could see the paratroopers\u0027 eyeballs,\u0027 he said, \u0027and the guns strapped to their gear.\u0027 His aircraft, one of the airline\u0027s four Tridents, was later wheeled to the head of the runway in a bid to prevent Turkish planes from landing. It was promptly blown to bits by Turkish bombs          It\u0027s hard to fathom now, but this hole-strewn hallway in the arrival terminal was once part of a modern, new terminal designed by a German company, which opened on March 27, 1968. The new terminal could accommodate 800 passengers at one time and the parking apron eleven aircraft. Nicosia International Airport now stands thick with dust while old aircraft decay next to the landing strips outside in the largely disused airport located 8.2km west of the Cypriot capital city of Nicosia          Also abandoned, this is the former Nicosia International Airport control tower which has deteriorated dramatically since the the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. Currently, the runways and main airfield facilities are principally under the control of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force (UNFICYP) in Cyprus. The control tower is adjacent to the terminal building and two surviving aircraft, an Avro Shackleton and Hawker Siddeley Trident, which also lie derelict          A sign reading \u0027Tipping porters not allowed\u0027 has somehow remained upright, among rolls of barbed wire below a decades-old advertisement for Seiko watches inside the once state-of-the-art terminal. Once an emblem of the young republic\u0027s growing confidence just 14 years after independence from British colonial rule, the airport overnight became a symbol of a future hijacked by unresolved conflict. The airport was the scene of intense fighting during the invasion in 1974          This would have once been a bustling part of the terminal, where people gathered to grab a bite to eat, at the airport cafe. A bar can still be seen in the background, with a few dilapidated shelves and cupboards. During the invasion, Turkish forces tried to seize the international airport and effectively encircle the capital. Taking heavy losses, the attackers failed amid fierce resistance, prompting United Nations peacekeepers to take it over and declare it a U.N. protected zone          A sad sight: The shell of an airplane, which has been sitting for 44 years at the abandoned Nicosia International Airport in Nicosia, Cyprus. All that remains is the exterior of the plane, as the rest of its key features have been gutted for years. The airport\u0027s grounds remain the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force on the island and serve as the venue for U.N.-mediated reunification talks. Herders can sometimes be seen moving their goats across the airport tarmac          Debris and bird droppings cover what were once comfortable chairs for those visiting Cyprus, while the floor of the passenger departure area at the former airport is also a mess. Crumbling walls, with ripped cigarette advertisements, can also be seen in the background of Nicosia International Airport. Larnaca International Airport (LCA), a new airport, was opened in the Republic of Cyprus in 1975, after Nicosia\u0027s closure, while Paphos International Airport (PFO) followed in 1983            The former baggage claim hall at Nicosia International Airport stands decaying inside the buffer zone on the southern, Greek side of the ided city on March 7, 2017 in Nicosia, Cyprus. The airport was abandoned following the ceasefire of the 1974 war and today stands derelict. Nicosia, the Cypriotic capital, has been ided into a Greek south and Turkish north ever since the brief but devastating war of 1974. Since then United Nations peacekeepers have maintained a buffer zone          More bird dropping-splattered seats are evident in the departure lounge inside the old Nicosia airport terminal building, now located within the UN-controlled buffer zone that separates the Turkish-occupied north from the south of Cyprus. To mark the International Day of Peace, UNFICYP once organised a Cyprus Peace Concert at the decaying terminal that has been closed since the 1974 Turkish invasion of North Cyprus.

That\u0027s taken me about five years.\u0027Despite having no background in model making, Mr Wrobel believe his design is the best in its scale.  He said: \u0027I have really gone to a lot of trouble going through old maps and drawings to get it right.\u0027I\u0027m pretty pleased with it in terms of its accuracy.\u0027 Mr Wrobel still has to act out the key moments of the battle and document it in his photobook.He said: \u0027I think that will take me a couple of years, and then when I am done I will do it all again but, but moving all the troops doing what in my view Napoleon should have done.\u0027So I will do my photobooks of what did happen and what might have happened.\u0027He said there are two professional models to rival his own - both in museums.But the scales are different, and while the most famous one at the National Army Museum, made in the nineteenth century, is much bigger, the characters are much smaller and it cannot be used for war gaming in the same way.           Figurines of French and English troops on the battle, as they would have been in 1815.

A policeman told us the area was being evacuated,\u0027 he said.\u0027There was a traffic jam because the roads are not built for all the aid vehicles that have come to help.\u0027Authorities raised the death toll from the weekend\u0027s eruption on Tuesday, as rescue teams continued the grim search for the missing.Meanwhile, strong explosions blew ash more than 16,000ft (5,000m) above sea level, with volcanic material blown over settlements to the east and north-east.\u0027We heard the eruption, it sounds a lot like thunder – every time I hear thunder I think \u0027not again\u0027,\u0027 Mr Goldsmith said\u0027The weather has also been a problem, the heavy rain is a concern as mudslides are a risk. We are very much in the wet season now.\u0027Mr Goldsmith joined volunteers transporting supplies to towns and villages near the volcano.

We went to a village today where they did not have any running water and relied on rain water.\u0027Now they are completely without water because of the ash, they don\u0027t have food because all the crops are destroyed. The sulphur in the volcanic ash means they won\u0027t be able to grow anything.  Mr Goldsmith joined volunteers transporting supplies to towns and villages near the volcano.

A lot of them have lost family members.\u0027I was chatting to a guy who was driving one of the vans with supplies, he had lost four or five family members – uncles, aunties, cousins – but he was still helping out.\u0027He was fighting back tears while he was driving to the market to buy things.\u0027Mr Kerlin said he felt safe in Antigua, but added: \u0027I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s just naivety.\u0027While the volunteers\u0027 immediate efforts are focused on delivering essential supplies to those affected by the disaster, there are concerns for the long-term impact on the area.\u0027I don\u0027t think the villages will be the same again,\u0027 he said.                                                      Robbers flee on moped after robbery at Regent St jewellery shopIrate cyclist uses CAR HORN to clear pedestrians out of bike lanesTourist mugged by gang outside Magaluf rocksNightclub owner Peter Stringfellow dies from cancer at age of 77Hammer wielding gangs clash outside of a primary schoolTravellers wash their horses at the Appleby Horse FairNewborn baby is MIRACULOUSLY alive after being buried for 8 HOURSDavis says there is \u0027every reason\u0027 Brexit negotiations will succeedBritish grandmother may be deported from Perth within weeksAlligator lurks near boy playing outside with toy alligatorAstonishing moment bystanders chase moped gang on Regent Street\u0027She was my second mum\u0027: Heartbroken neighbour of Sophia KaczanA soldier rescues a girl from a hole in an area affected by the eruption of Fuego volcano in Escuintla, Guatemala  A rescue worker carries a flock of farm birds rescued from homes destroyed by the eruption in El Rodeo          Rescue workers carry injured pets and livestock to safety in the aftermath of the deadly eruption  Thick gray ash covering the stricken region was hardened by rainfall, making it even more difficult to dig through the mud, rocks and debris that reached to the rooftops of homes   Rain often forced teams to retreat for fear of mudslides and boiling water flowing down the volcano\u0027s slopes from dangerously hot volcanic gas and ash also posed a threat   Rescue operators said after 72 hours there was virtually no chance of finding anyone else alive           Volunteers are seen preparing food rations after Fuego volcano erupted in Alotenango, Guatemala, sparking new evacuationsIn past disasters in which authorities determined there was no chance of finding survivors and further efforts to recover bodies would be too difficult, areas have been declared burial sites, the final resting place of the victims.Asked about that possibility, the director of Guatemala\u0027s disaster agency, Sergio Cabanas, said: \u0027Not until the search efforts are over, and it would be left up to the people.\u0027 The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it released more than $253,446 from its global emergency fund to support frontline emergency efforts.These funds will help \u0027Guatemala Red Cross support 3,000 of the most vulnerable survivors for three months,\u0027 they added.In addition, the Mexican government said on Wednesday evening that it would send a team of medical specialists and, if necessary, transfer victims to hospitals in Mexico.The 3,763-meter (12,346-feet) Volcan de Fuego is one of several active volcanoes among 34 in the Central American country.

The airfield was abandoned following the ceasefire of the 1974 war and today stands derelict. Nicosia, the Cypriot capital, was ided into a Greek south and Turkish north area after the brief but devastating war of 1974          Definitely a no-go area: Rolls of sharp barbed wire prevents entry into the main hall inside the decaying Nicosia International Airport. Closed since 1974, Nicosia was the island\u0027s primary airport. It is now abandoned and located in the UN-controlled Buffer Zone which separates the Turkish-occupied north from the south. The airport\u0027s crumbling walls, barbed wire and deserted airfield are a far cry from its heyday, as the gateway to sun-filled holidays in Cyprus          Parts of this plane appear to have been shot at, and scavenged, while the elements have clearly also taken a toll. This picture shows the rusting, discoloured exterior of the fuselage of an Cyprus Airways Trident passenger jet parked on the tarmac of the long-abandoned complex. Nicosia International Airport was used as the island’s principal airport. However it was initially a military air base, and underwent expansion during the Second World War          You\u0027d need more than a mop here: Bird droppings cover nearly every part of the passenger departure area in Nicosia, Cyprus, while in the ceiling above, light fixtures have become rusty because of the lack of maintenance over more than four decades. It\u0027s hard to believe it was once a beacon for holidaymakers, who once flocked to the airport before journeying to and from holiday destinations at stunning resorts nearby. Local wildlife, however, is obviously taking advantage of its abandonment          No passports needed: This office has been boarded up for over 40 years now, with just the sign about the doorway showing its former life as the official border control post. Speaking about the 1974 invasion, Captain Adamos Marneros was flying when he saw Turkish warships approaching the Mediterranean island in an invasion triggered by a coup by Greek Cypriots aiming to unite with Greece.  The pilot recalled he \u0027couldn\u0027t allow myself to be frightened\u0027 because he had to land the plane safely           The former main terminal at Nicosia International Airport stands decaying inside the buffer zone on the southern, Greek side of the ided city in Cyprus. Capt Marneros, who was then a 27-year-old pilot with national carrier Cyprus Airway, said he had deep misgivings about making the flight to Nicosia. After a sleepless night in his London hotel room watching TV reports of the buildup to invasion, he pleaded on three separate occasions with the airline\u0027s boss to cancel the flight - to no avail          Spooky too: The former arrivals hall in the main terminal at the airport also looks bare, with debris covering the floor, while an old sign can be seen with the word \u0027Yes\u0027 to the rear, near passport control. Recalling his flight\u0027s approach to the island in darkness, Capt Marneros saw the hulking silhouettes of warships \u0027creeping\u0027 toward Cypriot shores. His warnings to the airport control tower were met with what he said were halfhearted attempts to ease his concerns          A dilapidated plane, lies abandoned on the tarmac. Capt Marneros was among the last to leave the airport during an evacuation. As he left in his car, he caught sight of Turkish paratroopers just north of the airport drifting down from the skies. \u0027I could see the paratroopers\u0027 eyeballs,\u0027 he said, \u0027and the guns strapped to their gear.\u0027 His aircraft, one of the airline\u0027s four Tridents, was later wheeled to the head of the runway in a bid to prevent Turkish planes from landing. It was promptly blown to bits by Turkish bombs          It\u0027s hard to fathom now, but this hole-strewn hallway in the arrival terminal was once part of a modern, new terminal designed by a German company, which opened on March 27, 1968. The new terminal could accommodate 800 passengers at one time and the parking apron eleven aircraft. Nicosia International Airport now stands thick with dust while old aircraft decay next to the landing strips outside in the largely disused airport located 8.2km west of the Cypriot capital city of Nicosia          Also abandoned, this is the former Nicosia International Airport control tower which has deteriorated dramatically since the the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. Currently, the runways and main airfield facilities are principally under the control of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force (UNFICYP) in Cyprus. The control tower is adjacent to the terminal building and two surviving aircraft, an Avro Shackleton and Hawker Siddeley Trident, which also lie derelict          A sign reading \u0027Tipping porters not allowed\u0027 has somehow remained upright, among rolls of barbed wire below a decades-old advertisement for Seiko watches inside the once state-of-the-art terminal. Once an emblem of the young republic\u0027s growing confidence just 14 years after independence from British colonial rule, the airport overnight became a symbol of a future hijacked by unresolved conflict. The airport was the scene of intense fighting during the invasion in 1974          This would have once been a bustling part of the terminal, where people gathered to grab a bite to eat, at the airport cafe. A bar can still be seen in the background, with a few dilapidated shelves and cupboards. During the invasion, Turkish forces tried to seize the international airport and effectively encircle the capital. Taking heavy losses, the attackers failed amid fierce resistance, prompting United Nations peacekeepers to take it over and declare it a U.N. protected zone          A sad sight: The shell of an airplane, which has been sitting for 44 years at the abandoned Nicosia International Airport in Nicosia, Cyprus. All that remains is the exterior of the plane, as the rest of its key features have been gutted for years. The airport\u0027s grounds remain the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force on the island and serve as the venue for U.N.-mediated reunification talks. Herders can sometimes be seen moving their goats across the airport tarmac          Debris and bird droppings cover what were once comfortable chairs for those visiting Cyprus, while the floor of the passenger departure area at the former airport is also a mess. Crumbling walls, with ripped cigarette advertisements, can also be seen in the background of Nicosia International Airport. Larnaca International Airport (LCA), a new airport, was opened in the Republic of Cyprus in 1975, after Nicosia\u0027s closure, while Paphos International Airport (PFO) followed in 1983            The former baggage claim hall at Nicosia International Airport stands decaying inside the buffer zone on the southern, Greek side of the ided city on March 7, 2017 in Nicosia, Cyprus. The airport was abandoned following the ceasefire of the 1974 war and today stands derelict. Nicosia, the Cypriotic capital, has been ided into a Greek south and Turkish north ever since the brief but devastating war of 1974. Since then United Nations peacekeepers have maintained a buffer zone          More bird dropping-splattered seats are evident in the departure lounge inside the old Nicosia airport terminal building, now located within the UN-controlled buffer zone that separates the Turkish-occupied north from the south of Cyprus. To mark the International Day of Peace, UNFICYP once organised a Cyprus Peace Concert at the decaying terminal that has been closed since the 1974 Turkish invasion of North Cyprus. Reunification talks crashed at a Swiss summit last summer  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/18/4D01624900000578-5817865-Footage_shows_the_vulnerable_beast_walk_across_a_fallen_tree_and-m-21_1528390946007.jpg","title":"Orangutan defends forest grabbing digger","story":"    This is the harrowing moment an orangutan tries to defend its forest by grabbing at a digger          Footage shows the vulnerable beast walk across a fallen tree and lean towards the heavy machineryThe orangutan tries to grab on to the digger as it is lifted into the air but falls before it can latch onto the vehicle.A man, who is a member of the Orangutan Protection Unit for the International Animal Rescue non-profit organisation, can be seen in the video creeping under the animal with a dart gun.He successfully captures the creature and then moves it to safety.

She lost her footing near the Scout Rock lookout and fell into dense bushland, knocking herself unconscious for over five hours. Paramedic Hannah Gaulke told AAP Han survived by “crawling and scraping” her way through tough terrain until she found a “slippery, rocky waterfall” with running water. Han stayed there for days until emergency crews rescued her on Thursday afternoon, using a helicopter and 60-foot (18m) winch to pull her from the ravine. “In the entire time she was missing she’d had no food with her at all,” Gaulke said. A Scottish tourist who was staying at the same hostel as Han described it as a “miracle”. “I’ve climbed that thing three times, two in a group and one myself, and after I did it myself I said I would never be going up again,” Craig Strathie told the ABC. “Heck, I’m Scottish — we’ve got mountains all the time, but that thing can be pretty dangerous.”The area’s Special Emergency Services coordinator, Eleanor Rosam, said it was “a very difficult” track that was not used frequently. On Friday Han was recuperating in Tully hospital, where she was treated for dehydration and minor scratches. Gaulke said she had “no significant injuries” and was in good spirits. Insp Steve Kersley from Queensland police said Han had “done well to survive” the ordeal. “Six days is a long time to be lost in the bush,” he said.

In the very early moments of the 14th last year, as the fire took hold, she was on the other side of London, celebrating with friends. As she got into bed, just after 1am, she checked her phone and saw the first pictures of the blaze that would kill 72 people, then just beginning to creep up from the fourth floor.“It was just so shocking,” Burke says. “This bloody tower block – it was devastating. We just sat there in the morning, for a good two hours, open-mouthed, watching the news.”Like many other Londoners, Burke spent the days that followed veering between righteous fury and grief for the victims. Burke grew up in council housing herself, in a 1920s tenement in Islington, north London, not far from where she lives today. “They were sort of nice,” she says. “We had a nice bit of green out the front. I had mates who lived in tower blocks and I always hated seeing them, because of the lifts, y’know? My God, so scary. It was similar to Kensington, because the very rich and the poor lived side by side.”Then came a fortuitous tweet. Paul Jenkins, someone Burke followed on Twitter (“because he’s very sweary, very angry, and I like that”), sent her a message. He had been speaking to Rhona Martin, a woman who lived with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and was worried about the survivors. Could they help?Mountains of food, clothes and toiletries were already piling up in town halls and churches. “We knew donating stuff wasn’t going to help, because they had too much. We had to look at the bigger picture, what we could do for the future,” says Burke.Jenkins and Martin suggested a book: 24 Stories, one for each floor of the tower. Twelve would be written by well-known authors – including AL Kennedy, Meera Syal, John Niven and Irvine Welsh – and 12 by newcomers. All were given the broad remit of hope, community and positivity. “We didn’t want it to be full of dark, depressing stories. We wanted it to be as uplifting as it could be,” says Burke.Only two of the stories mention Grenfell, the most explicitly connected being “Singing in the Dark Times”, Pauline Melville’s story of a homeless man navigating London after the tragedy. The other pieces are united by their shared humour and tenderness even Welsh, not known for “uplifting” writing, contributed “Seventeen-Storey Love Song”, about a woman falling off a New York rooftop – and yes, it does have a happy ending.“I remember watching the news for hours with my kids,” says Nina Stibbe, who contributed “The Language of Flowers”. “We were all devastated, by the idea of people dying in their flats. They still can’t stop talking about it. When we go to London, they ask, ‘Will we see that tower?’ It is deeply, deeply symbolic for people.”Two weeks after Jenkins messaged Burke, 24 Stories was launched on the website of the crowdfunding publisher Unbound in four days, the project was fully funded (with the help of JK Rowling and Gary Lineker) within another three weeks, they had 500 stories competing for the 12 newcomer spots. Burke, who was casting two plays at the time, helped whittle down a longlist of 60.Burke’s career has taken many surprising directions. She performed in 90s TV comedies Absolutely Fabulous and Gimme Gimme Gimme and starred in acclaimed dramas such as Mr Wroe’s Virgins and Gary Oldman’s film Nil by Mouth. At one point she quit acting altogether. In the theatre she recently directed Oscar Wilde’s Lady Windermere’s Fan and Sam Bain’s The Retreat, and she has writing credits to her name – so perhaps book editing is not such a great leap.All profits from 24 Stories will go to the Trauma Response Network, a charity set up after the Manchester bomb attack last year. “The survivors of Grenfell lost their homes, en masse, through no fault of their own,” writes neuroscientist Dean Burnett in the introduction to 24 Stories. “Many of them lost friends and loved ones, too, at the same time. They ended up with nowhere to go, no resources to fall back on and at the mercy of a system that clearly didn’t care and, from what we can see, still doesn’t. Not to have some form of PTSD would be more than unlikely – it would be borderline miraculous.”Burke is aware that her support of the charity may be construed as self-promotion, she says some celebrities were criticised for turning up in the aftermath, even with offers of money and donations. Stibbe feels the same: “I was a little nervous about getting involved, because you think, ‘Who am I to talk about this?’” she says. “People are going to say, ‘So, what have you done?’ I’m a writer. Kathy is a writer, actor and director. We do what we can.”“This was a great idea and we just ran with it,” Burke says, firmly. The hope, she says, is that people will buy it and fund the survivors’ treatment – and be reminded of what happened every time they glance at their bookshelves. “Seventy-two people died,” she says, “but hundreds of people are going to have to live with it for the rest of their lives” •"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e0113668e3794ead4baa621647f6aafc342fd90/0_278_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f47cb911481193771fe5366402e521a4","title":"house of fraser to close more than half of its british stores","story":"Department store chain will shut 31 outlets, including London flagshipAt least 11,000 jobs are at risk as House of Fraser prepares to close more than half its UK stores and Poundworld teeters on the brink of administration, in the latest blow to the high streets.House of Fraser unveiled a plan designed to stave off collapse which will mean the closure of 31 of its 59 department stores including its Oxford Street flagship in London and its shops in cities including Birmingham, Cardiff and Edinburgh. As many as 6,000 jobs could be lost - 2,000 direct HoF employees and 4,000 who work for in-store concessions.The move by the 169-year-old company is part of a rescue plan that will also lead to House of Fraser moving out of its head offices in London and Glasgow and closing a distribution centre in Milton Keynes where more than 400 more jobs are under threat.Up to 5,000 more jobs are at risk at the 355-store Poundworld chain which on Thursday gave notice that it intends to appoint administrators. The legal process provides court protection from creditors for 10 days while the company attempts to mount a last-ditch rescue. However, even if a buyer comes forward at the 11th hour, they would be expected to close down a large part of the store estate.Poundworld’s private equity owner TPG Capital is understood to be unwilling to pump more cash into the business. TPG said a key reason for Poundworld’s problems was the Brexit blow to sterling, which pushed up the cost of imported goods. The two chains’ difficulties come after a string of retailers and restaurant groups, including Mothercare, Carpetright, New Look, Prezzo and Jamie’s Italian, have announced plans to close hundreds of outlets putting more than 35,000 jobs on the block so far this year. DIY chain Homebase is also expected to close about 60 stores after a £1 rescue takeover by restructuring specialist Hilco which will be completed this month.House of Fraser traces its origins back to 1849, when Hugh Fraser and James Arthur opened a drapery shop on the corner of Argyle Street and Buchanan Street in the centre of Glasgow. By 1941, it had expanded into a number of shops in Scotland and became House of Fraser.The 1950s marked a period of major expansion for House of Fraser. In 1953, still owned by the Fraser family, the group extended its geographic reach across Scotland and into north-east England and Carlisle with the purchase of the Binns chain, which had its origins in an early 19th century Sunderland drapery business. Harrods, the luxury London department store, and Dickins \u0026amp Jones, became part of the House of Fraser group in the late 1950s.Growth continued in the 1970s, with the addition of well-known names such as Rackhams, the Army \u0026amp Navy stores and Dingles.Change came in 1985 when the House of Fraser group was bought by the Al Fayed family for £615m and a new business strategy was announced, with plans to replace smaller branches with larger stores.In 1994 House of Fraser was floated on the London Stock Exchange at a market value of £484m, with Harrods split off and kept under private ownership by Al Fayed.A takeover bid from Scottish retail entrepreneur Tom Hunter was rejected in 2003 and some branches in Scotland were sold or closed.However, two years later the group was in expansion mode again, buying 16 stores under the Jenners and Beatties brands became part of the group in 2005. Large new store openings followed in 2008 at locations including Belfast, Bristol and the Westfield shopping centre in west London.In 2013, House of Fraser opened its first store overseas, in Abu Dhabi’s World Trade Center shopping mall.House of Fraser was bought by China’s Nanjing Xinjiekou Department Store Co – also known as Nanjing Cenbest – in 2014. Angela MonaghanAlex Williamson, House of Fraser’s chief executive, said that without the proposed store closures the business was likely to collapse.“A decision to close this number of stores is not done lightly. This is really grim,” Williamson said. “It is a highly emotional, highly regrettable situation that none of us either imagined or wanted to see happen, but there is simply no alternative.”Outside the Oxford Street store, which has been trading since 1879, Jeanne Bateman from Norwich said: “I’m a big high street shopper. I’m very sad to see so many big high street names closing down. I feel sorry for us the shopper, and very sorry for the people who work here.” Her daughter, Catherine Wilamowska, agreed, but added that because she lives in a small village she does all her shopping online. Wilamowska’s habits reflect a changing world in which about a fifth of all UK retail spending has moved on to the internet. While online specialists such as Amazon, Boohoo and Asos continue to expand rapidly, traditional retailers are struggling to adapt as many are stuck in now unprofitable stores on long and expensive leases. Switching to selling online also requires heavy investment in IT and delivery networks at a time when cost prices have risen as a result in fall of the value of the pound. Many retailers are also facing big increases in business rates, together with higher labour costs as a result of the national minimum wage and apprenticeship levy. At the same time shoppers have reined back spending on clothing and household goods because of a squeeze on spare cash and a shift to renting rather than owning homes.The House of Fraser chairman, Frank Slevin, said: “The retail industry is undergoing fundamental change and House of Fraser urgently needs to adapt to this fast-changing landscape in order to give it a future and allow it to thrive.”In a presentation to investors, the company admitted it had made mistakes with its website and by cutting back on in-house womenswear brands, but it also blamed Brexit and the fall in the value of the pound for pushing up costs for retailers. Dave Gill, national officer at the shopworkers’ union Usdaw, said: “This is devastating news for House of Fraser employees. We are receiving calls from loyal and long-serving staff who are extremely worried, including those who work in brand concessions and are not directly employed by House of Fraser.”He added that although HoF does not recognise Usdaw, he had asked the retailer “to engage in urgent talks, so that we can challenge the business case, investigate what can be done to save jobs and represent our members’ best interests”.The restructuring and closures are a condition of a deal that will give control of House of Fraser to the Chinese C.banner business, which also owns Hamleys.It is feared House of Fraser could struggle to complete the CVA, as landlords and lenders have expressed concerns about a lack of consultation and fears that C.banner will not be able to inject sufficient cash into the business to turn it around.Williamson said management had been forced to take brave decisions, including closing some of its most high-profile stores, to try to ensure the business had a future. “There are too many case studies of CVAs that have not worked, and this is not going to be one of them,” he said.C.banner has committed to putting £70m into House of Fraser after the restructure which Williamson said would help turn it around.The company has also put another £1m into its pension fund after discussions with trustees, who expressed concerns about protection for savers in the restructure. On Thursday, landlords called for an urgent government review of the rising use of CVAs, which they say risks undermining the UK’s reputation and deters investment in town centres.The British Property Federation said it believed the process was being misused.Melanie Leech, the chief executive of the landlords’ group, said: “The CVA process is intended to be part of a comprehensive business recovery plan. “Property owners, looking after savers’ and pensioners’ money, will support businesses who demonstrate this commitment, but must protect those pensioners against unfair action that penalises their interests.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0602adc3bb1f3cf5fb9a7ca9d3b9add0ac4ea53/0_67_2407_1444/master/2407.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0049589f139287781b8989cbec2ba63e","title":"paul dacre gone daily mail next associated newspapers","story":"Like all bullies, he targets underdogs – and those may soon include his successor at the paperAsked for the winning formula of his Daily Mail, Lord Northcliffe replied: “I give my readers a daily hate.” No one has kept that flame burning more brightly than Paul Dacre, poisoner of the national psyche, bully-in-chief, whose iron whim has terrified prime ministers for a quarter of a century, and who has announced he will be stepping down as the paper’s editor in November.Like all bullies he targets underdogs, imposing on the country racism, homophobia and philistinism, and shunning complexity and evidence. His sheer bully-power often frames the national debate by warping broadcasters’ news agendas, because they know the Mail makes politicians quake. Theresa May – his candidate – caves in to him every time, as paralysed on paying for social care as on Brexit. His legacy is the great Brexit ide that has torn the country in two.Decades of straight-banana EU fabrications and myths sowed the seeds, but nothing was as shocking as his front pages in the referendum run-up, filled with dark-skinned migrants making bogus claims, criminals and terrorists heading this way.Dacre defenders point to his championing of the murdered Stephen Lawrence – son of Dacre’s decorator – as if one case wipes clean the regular racist filth.With no compass as to where the true middle lies – it’s around £27,000 – his own £2.5m salary plus £1.4m bonus may skew his understanding. So may his Scottish estate, where activities include deer-stalking and grouse shooting, and his Sussex cattle farm, for which he draws bundles in EU agricultural subsidy.His political modus operandi is to go for the jugular, to play the person, not the ball. So when Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, expressed her members’ alarm at how a hard Brexit might kill their businesses, Dacre’s Mail did her over – and her family – in a savage double-page spread.It works: industrialists dare not put their head above the Brexit parapet for fear of the Mail lopping it off. When Gina Miller bravely went to the high court to secure parliament’s right to a Brexit say, he found no actual dirt, but called her “a gloating Guyana-born investment manager who alternates between glorying in self-promotion and complaining that her safety is under threat”. Thanks to Mail nastiness, she – like Stella Creasy and other Dacred women – faces death threats.Why do people – especially women – read it? There is a gobsmacking fascination with his outrageous headlines: how far will he go? Women are a favoured target, the Mail acting as playground bitch, forever papping celebrities putting on weight, spotted without makeup, revealing cellulite in a bikini. The case of the Royal Navy’s Faye Turney was a classic: after she was captured by the Iranians, the Mail joined the chequebook stampede for her story, offering – according to the defence department – “a very substantial sum”. But when she told her story elsewhere, Dacre took revenge, savaging her as an unfit mother: a picture of soldiers’ coffins bore the headline, “They won’t be selling their stories.”As editor-in-chief and chair of the Associated Newspapers board, his hot, fiery breath and sweary bollockings may bear down on his successor. As he reputedly frightens his proprietor, Lord Rothermere, Dacre may be the one to appoint an editor in his own image, just as he followed the moralising tics and toxic politics of his predecessor, David English.Optimists hope the sheer democracy-threatening anarchism of his recent assaults on the supreme court as “enemies of the people” has finally stirred Rothermere to rid us of this mania. The obvious replacement is the Mail on Sunday editor, Geordie Greig, friend of the Rothermeres and well-liked in moderate Tory circles. But long-term enmity between Dacre and Greig has exploded into print with the MoS’s robust remainer stance landing like an Exocet into the heart of Dacre’s daily.Who else? Mentioned is George Osborne, the London Evening Standard editor: Mail-hard on austerity, but like Greig sharing none of Dacre’s retro social conservatism. At least one cloud would be lifted: Dacre’s nostalgic miasma of an imagined 1950s in the days before orce, career women, single mothers, perverts and ethnic minorities caused our mortal moral decline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a778b30b89287ecffd1cdbfab88b2f2f2cae4ced/0_94_3786_2272/master/3786.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea3eef7c36360a62cf60e140f5f67e87","title":"save planet meat dairy livestock food free range steak","story":"Farming livestock for food threatens all life on earth, and ‘free-range’ steak is the worst of allWhether human beings survive this century and the next, whether other lifeforms can live alongside us: more than anything, this depends on the way we eat. We can cut our consumption of everything else almost to zero and still we will drive living systems to collapse, unless we change our diets.Whenever I raise the crucial issue of yield per hectare, I receive a barrage of vituperation and abuse. But I’m not having a go at farmers, just pointing out that the figures don’t add up. We can neither feed the world’s growing population nor protect its living systems through animal farming. Meat and dairy are an extravagance we can no longer afford. There is no way out of this. Those who claim that “regenerative” or “holistic” ranching mimics nature deceive themselves. It relies on fencing, while in nature wild herbivores roam freely, often across vast distances. It excludes or eradicates predators, which are crucial to the healthy functioning of all living systems. It tends to eliminate tree seedlings, ensuring that the complex mosaics of woody vegetation found in many natural systems – essential to support a wide range of wildlife – are absent. Unless you can cook well – and many people have neither the skills nor the space – a plant-based diet can be either boring or expensive. We need better and cheaper vegan ready meals and quick and easy meat substitutes. The big shift will come with the mass production of cultured meat. There are three main objections. The first is that the idea of artificial meat is disgusting. If you feel this way, I invite you to look at how your sausages, burgers and chicken nuggets are currently raised, slaughtered and processed. Having worked on an intensive pig farm, I’m more aware than most of what disgusting looks like.This could also be a chance to break our complete dependence on artificial nitrogen. Traditionally, animal and plant farming were integrated through the use of manure. Losses from this system led to a gradual decline in soil fertility. The development of industrial fertilisers saved us from starvation, but at a high environmental cost. Today, the link between livestock and crops has mostly been broken: crops are grown with industrial chemicals while animal slurry stacks up, unused, in stinking lagoons, wipes out rivers and creates dead zones at sea. When it is applied to the land, it threatens to accelerate antibiotic resistance.Understandably, the livestock industry will resist all this, using the bucolic images and pastoral fantasies that have beguiled us for so long. But it can’t force us to eat meat. The shift is ours to make. It becomes easier every year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82ed2537fd95a6a6e43e2548401098e39f39ee0f/0_275_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8edd76305245ab2e1a2bd3632e11bf4c","title":"appleby horse fair 2018 in pictures","story":"Thousands of Gypsies and Travellers from across Britain congregate at this annual event to buy and sell horses.

Starting from 2020 this will almost certainly mean fines – potentially of millions of euros – being levied by the European commission.Ireland has also been heavily in the news recently over the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment, which prohibited abortion. The role of the Citizens’ Assembly, an exercise in deliberative democracy, in the process has, quite rightly, been lauded. It proved that given time, access to expert evidence, the absence of the proverbial megaphones of vested interests, and a conducive environment to discuss issues, citizens can, and will, come to informed and nuanced opinions.Less well known, at least outside Ireland, is that the assembly have considered a number of additional topics. These included how the state can help make Ireland a leader in tackling climate change. As noted already, Ireland’s progress to date on this issue has been wholly inadequate.It was my privilege to serve on the expert advisory group of the assembly for its climate deliberations. Citizens were presented over two weekends with what amounted to a crash course in, not just the evidence basis for climate change, but also what critical aspects of their life, such as energy, transport, agriculture, and our homes might look like 30 years hence, were Ireland to become a leader in tackling climate change. They were also shown inspiring present day exemplars such as the Dublin fire brigade station that has gone carbon neutral, through community owned renewable energy efforts in Tipperary, to organic low-impact farmers. Crucially, these discussions were undertaken without the voices of vested interests, from both ends of the spectrum. These all too often tend to obfuscate, and discussions of climate change in the public sphere turn into a slanging match.Real efforts were made to ensure that the questions given were balanced and nuanced and properly reflected trade-offs that would be required in the real-world. There were no questions, for example, about subsidies without a commensurate counterweight of a source of increased revenues to cover the costs. But they also recognised aspects such as equity that could and should be achieved. So, for example, there was a question around raising taxes on carbon intensive activities. But the funds would then be ringfenced and used to enable the transition to lower-intensity activities, with priority given to those in fuel poverty and community owned activities.The citizens were almost unanimous in desiring an act similar to the UK Climate Change Act with a watchdog similar to the Climate Change Committee charged with setting sector-wise targets but given real teeth – the ability to sue the government or other public bodies for non-conformance.The citizens also voted strongly for the imposition of tax and subsidy basis for the farming sector to penalise carbon intensive activities and encourage more climate friendly behaviours in the sector. They also wanted Ireland to reimagine its approach to transport, in both urban and rural areas.The recently unveiled 2040 strategy of the government, if enacted in full, starts to make substantive progress in addressing many, but by no means all, of the issues raised. But, unless and until strategy is translated into action and results across successive governments the jury must remain out.There is clearly an enormous appetite to make Ireland live up to its reputation as the emerald island by being a leader in addressing climate change. Citizens recognised the competitive advantages of energy independence and first mover advantage, as well as co-benefits such as air quality improvements.Will our politicians give the same due diligence to the Citizens’ Assembly’s climate change considerations as the eighth amendment?

But for fearless, witty depictions of women’s bodies, audiences have always had to look elsewhereThese days, it seems no raunchy femme-centric Hollywood comedy or TV sitcom is without its obligatory vagina reference. “I was just washing my vagina,” they say or, “I’m gonna punch her in the vagina.” The word “vagina” is bandied about as though we are expected to fall about laughing at the very idea of it. And maybe I would laugh, if only I weren’t more bemused than amused by the perplexing way “vagina” appears to have expanded to embrace not just the vagina itself, but the vulva and the female pubic area in general.But Hollywood, as ever, is all talk. In an industry run by overgrown schoolboys, breasts remain the primary female erogenous zone. Despite the pioneering work of Sharon Stone crossing her legs in Basic Instinct (1992), visible vulva is, unsurprisingly, a rarity in mainstream cinema, possibly because it’s not considered as titillating as big bazoomas.Perhaps this is for the best, though, since the last thing we need are gross-out comedies in which women’s nether regions get the same treatment as testicles: Ben Stiller’s caught in his zip in There’s Something About Mary (1998) or Will Poulter’s grotesquely inflamed by a spider bite in We’re the Millers (2013). “Closeups make us anxious about things,” Jean-Luc Godard once said, and he had a point.Lad-com producer and director Judd Apatow, having already discovered the comic potential of gratuitous todger in Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) and the criminally underrated Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (2007), inserted a closeup of a baby being squeezed out of a real vagina in Knocked Up (2007), but one suspects this was more in a quest for male adolescent yucks than an attempt to even things up.For the real money shots, as usual, we must look to the Europeans, whose fearlessness in the gynaecological sector rivals men’s top-shelf magazines in their pre-Pornhub heyday. The French film-maker Catherine Breillat, for example, out-Apatows Apatow with an explicit cervical examination and birth sequence in Romance (1999). Then, in Anatomy of Hell (2004), she got porn actor-director Rocco Siffredi (AKA “the Italian Stallion”) to apply lipstick to the labia and anus of his leading lady’s vulva double, though in both films the characters’ tendency to earnestly debate gender politics undercuts potential shock value, let alone any hint of eroticism (which is presumably the intention). Meanwhile, her compatriot François Ozon’s preposterous but delicious thriller L’Amant Double (2017), kicks off its daft plot with a speculum’s-eye view of the female protagonist’s internal couloir: about as sexy as a smear test, but a witty invitation into its heroine’s psyche.The Eisenstein of the arty obstetric shot is Gaspar Noé, who in Enter the Void (2009) and Love (2015) inserts trippy, semi-abstract imagery of penises penetrating vaginas, shot from the vaginal perspective in glorious red and orange with sporadic strobe effectx. Typically, Lars von Trier is more mean-spirited with his full-on frontal scenes in Antichrist (2009), where Charlotte Gainsbourg no sooner exposes her lady parts than she’s snipping away at them with scissors.More lyrically, The Invader (2011) by Belgian director Nicolas Provost, begins with a medium closeup of a pudendum posed like Gustave Courbet’s 1866 painting L’Origine du Monde, followed by a two-minute Steadicam shot of its serene white owner getting to her feet and strolling across a nudist beach towards the sea – where half-drowned African migrants are being washed up on the shore.Presenting the case for more playful vaginal action, albeit in a film that elsewhere features stalking and rape, Pedro Almodóvar’s adorable pastiche of a silent-movie dream sequence in Talk to Her (2002) shows a tiny man shedding his vest and pants to crawl inside a gigantic simulacrum of his lover’s vagina, which looms over him like a dirigible fringed in AstroTurf. More bonkers still is Ken Russell’s Lisztomania (1975) in which Roger Daltrey, dressed in a purple crinoline, gets sucked into an outsize replica of Sara Kestleman’s gusset before re-emerging with an eight-foot erection. But this is merely a prelude to a Busby Berkeley-esque musical number in which his former mistresses commandeer his phallus for a maypole dance before chopping off the glans with a guillotine. Vagina for the win!

The film is about the Mongol Derby, a brutally punishing 1,000-kilometre endurance race across Mongolia, recreating Genghis Khan’s 13th-century horse-messenger trail.Riders have to use the wild horses they’re given and ride all day for about 10 days, changing mounts every 40 kilometres. They are intensively tracked and monitored with GPS, with hyper-alert support teams of doctors and vets, although psychotherapists would probably also be a good idea. The contestants face tough terrain, the possibility of encountering wolves and probableinevitable injury – or, as someone cheerfully puts it: “faceplanting”, which could lead to broken necks. It looks as terrifyingly dangerous as the TT races in the Isle of Man.There have been Mongolian competitors in the Mongol Derby but by and large the riders seem to be from Europe, America, Britain and Ireland, and there is, just possibly, a quasi-colonial experience in the race, although it is more nuanced than this: a black South African rider’s presence complicates this impression. One rider says: “You don’t want to go through this so quickly – you don’t enjoy the culture and the landscape.”Perhaps there’s simply no other way to get through it – though Ivo Marloh’s camera gives some sense of the pure daunting vastness of the setting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddc398c9b2f0f9b5d10dcb3fbde191348f67c0bb/150_0_2576_1546/master/2576.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3b8374d4201cbd461030b1a03e737fe","title":"the boy brought up by hounds andrew kotting on a true shaggy dog story","story":"His new film, Lek and the Dogs, is about a boy who lived with a pack of wild animals in Moscow, and was inspired by Hattie Naylor’s haunting play. The film-maker and playwright talk about archetypal stories and abandoned childrenOn the desolate streets of Boris Yeltsin’s Moscow in the mid-90s, a four-year-old boy named Ivan Mishukov walked out of the home he shared with his mother and his alcoholic stepfather and began living with a pack of wild dogs. For two years, he ran with the mutts, begging for food that he distributed among them and curling up with them at night to protect himself from the harsh climate. The police tried several times to apprehend him, only to be thwarted in their attempts by his snarling posse. Eventually, he was packed off to a children’s shelter. He stopped growling and went back to speaking. “He appears to be just like any other Moscow child,” wrote Michael Newton in his book Savage Girls and Wild Boys: A History of Feral Children. “Yet it is said that, at night, he dreams of dogs.”The story, which was first reported in July 1998, has been fictionalised in works including Eva Hornung’s novel Dog Boy and the play My Life with the Dogs by the theatre company New International Encounter. But it is Hattie Naylor’s stark, haunting play Ivan and the Dogs that has inspired a new film from the British director and artist Andrew Kötting. Lek and the Dogs uses Ivan’s story to complete Kötting’s Earthworks trilogy, each instalment of which features the character Lek, played by the French actor and performance artist Xavier Tchili. The 2001 film This Filthy Earth was caked in mud and grime, while Ivul, from 2009, took place largely in the treetops.The new picture burrows beneath the earth, tracing the subterranean-dwelling LekIvan on a journey into his “disrupted” mental landscape and a past fraught with trauma. Kötting riffs imaginatively on the material, amplifying its resonances and peculiarities on every level: visual, audio and philosophical. He stitches archive footage into the fabric of the film, making its texture amorphous, mottled and strange locations range from French caves to a chalky Chilean ghost-town. The spine of the picture, though, is that enduring story.“It’s Romulus and Remus or The Jungle Book,” Naylor says. “It’s an archetypal story that’s embedded in us. And it works, I think, because it taps into our own confused relationship with animals and our own wildness, that question of whether it’s still there in us. The play has done particularly well in places where there has been a very recent collapse. It’s been all around Brazil. The poverty, the abandoned animals, they can still see it and feel it.” It was Newton’s book that introduced Naylor to Ivan. “There was very little information to go on, so in my version he leaves because he is hearing his stepfather beat up his mother. Then I researched what was happening to kids at that time. They were being abandoned, just like dogs were, because there was simply no money. Society was collapsing.”Naylor met Kötting in the 80s, when they were students at the Slade School of Fine Art. “We found each other in the basement, messing around with sound,” she recalls. She later named her theatre company after his 1996 debut feature, Gallivant, a warped and beguiling documentary in which the director travels the coastline of mainland Britain in the company of his grandmother and his seven-year-old daughter, Eden, who has the rare genetic condition Joubert syndrome. Lek and the Dogs, though, is Naylor and Kötting’s first collaboration. “He sort of destroyed my play,” she laughs. “But it’s an amazing piece of work. He’s an auteur, isn’t he? A one-off.”There is no disputing that. I travel to St Leonards in East Sussex, where Kötting lives. He meets me at the station, wheeling a bicycle and wearing a patched blue “upcycled” shirt made by his wife, Leila. He is 58, stocky and strong, with a ruddy face and spiky hair.As we eat fish and chips on the seafront, his eyes are darting and alert, always on the lookout for a telling detail. He points out the violent flapping of the deckchair fabric (“If I were filming you, I’d want to record that”). He gestures to a yellow buoy on the horizon, which he uses as a marker on his regular swims out to sea, and the bolthole in the distance that belongs to his friend and collaborator Iain Sinclair. Their projects together include Swandown, in which they piloted a swan pedalo from Hastings to the Olympic Park, and Sinclair’s book London Overground, about the pair’s perambulations around the “ginger line”.We repair after lunch to Kötting’s studio in Hastings Old Town. Paintings by Eden, who is now 30 and an accomplished artist, hang on the walls and from the ceiling. The nerve centre is a shed he has assembled inside the studio and into which he retreats to do most of his editing and tinkering, playing around with footage and sound design. It was Naylor, he says, who kept him on track as they wrote Lek together. “She was always banging on about story. ‘We can’t just be looking at stuff, we’ve got to respect the story.’ I gave up reading novels years ago. I lose interest. I’m not attracted to the linear. Collage is so much more satisfying. You can jump in and out and it still makes sense. It holds itself together. But I knew there was something in Hattie’s play that I could use as a springboard.”The director has always relied on “the angels of happenstance” as part of his creative process. Many of the visual coups in Lek and the Dogs were accidental: the discovery of a pile of abandoned shoes in the desert a pet cemetery that Kötting came across after his preferred ending of Lek playing Pied Piper to a pack of dogs proved impossible to shoot. Most startling are the wriggling, foetus-like creatures seen at the start of the film. I had taken them to be animatronic or stop-motion models. Not so, says Kötting: they were newborn baby loir (dormouse-like creatures) that dropped on to Eden’s desk while she was drawing in the family’s other home in the Pyrenees. “I went in there because I heard her laughing and calling me: ‘Papa, papa!’ I thought: ‘What the fuck are they?’ I got my camera and left it running. They were dead, but every now and then they would twitch. I hadn’t even started thinking about Lek at that point. Manna from heaven.”When he came to grade the footage for the film, he made sure it matched the tone of Tchili’s whitened skin as he scampers on all fours through the desert.The picture has an apocalyptic air that seems uncomfortably pertinent. “We’ve got the enemy now, haven’t we? Before, there was Thatcher. Now, it’s Brexit, North Korea, whatever. This is what happens. We build toward a climax and then it all peters out. I don’t know. I’m no Pollyanna, but I’m optimistic. In five years, we’ll all still be blundering along. There’ll be a few more traffic jams on the motorway. The film does resonate, though. Did you know they’re slaughtering dogs left, right and centre in Moscow at the moment? Thousands of them, ahead of the World Cup.” He shakes his head.Although we cover a lot of subjects, Kötting shows his only flickers of boredom when I ask what happened to Ivan later in life. “Who knows? He evaporated. Maybe he’s a drunk. Or maybe he’s playing football for Russia.”In fact, Ivan’s trail went cold very soon after the initial story broke. “There are a few photos of him online,” says Naylor. “But it all seemed to be suppressed by Russia. They claimed it didn’t happen. The last I heard, he joined the sea cadets at 17 and managed to readjust to society.”Kötting is content to let this sleeping dog lie. “I’m happy not knowing. The myth is the important thing. That and the fact that it’s true. We all need our mythical figures – Muhammad, Jesus, Robin Hood, Valerie Singleton – and Ivan is one of them.”• Lek and the Dogs is released on 8 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1821c4439b82582dce039a5c1d5ce51d55550e3/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb251f24a914a0d0044ed8dd1aa785ee","title":"england costa rica international friendly match report","story":"These are the moments when it is probably wise to remember – this being England, after all – that it is never sensible to overdose on optimism before the World Cup actually starts.Yet there are at least grounds for positivity and increasingly there is a sense that Gareth Southgate’s players are high on confidence, capable of putting together some vibrant football and not showing any obvious signs of the end-of-season fatigue that has weighed them down before major tournaments in the past.Southgate is certainly entitled to be encouraged after another satisfying win most notable for the spectacular first-half goal with which Marcus Rashford announced his intentions to press for a starting place when England arrive in Russia on Tuesday.At the very least Rashford has reminded the England manager that, on form, he is capable of producing moments of outstanding and rare quality. He can be erratic sometimes, yes, but on this evidence he can trouble even the most accomplished defences and when Rashford can score goals of this brilliance it is tempting to make an argument that Southgate should find a way to shoehorn him into the team.The reality, however, is that by the time England are ready to face Tunisia in Volgograd on Monday week it might be that only John Stones from this starting lineup will be among Southgate’s first-team picks. The latest friendly was a game for the back-up players mostly. It was not only Rashford who seized the opportunity – Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Fabian Delph both impressed in their attacking midfield roles – but however much Southgate talked about places still being up for grabs the likelihood is that the players he selected for the 2-1 win against Nigeria last Saturday will, on the whole, begin in the World Cup.Jack Butland Surprisingly given the nod ahead of Jordan Pickford\u0026nbspbut the Stoke keeper made a couple of decent stops. 7Phil Jones Did little wrong but did not come under much pressure and\u0026nbspalways sense he could drop a clanger. 6John Stones Only player to start both warm-up games but gave the ball\u0026nbspaway a couple of times. 6Harry Maguire\u0026nbspLucky to get away with it on two occasions when Joel Campbell got in behind him. 6Trent Alexander-Arnold\u0026nbspUnlikely to oust Kieran Trippier for a starting\u0026nbspspot in Russia but the youngest player in the squad coped well. 7Jordan Henderson Wore the captain\u0027s armband and constantly looked to press the opposition – but Southgate may prefer Eric Dier. 7Danny Rose\u0026nbspShowed enormous bravery off the pitch this week and started\u0026nbspbrightly but was disappointing in second half. 6Ruben Loftus-Cheek Linked up well with Henderson and\u0026nbspprovided the assist for Rashford\u0027s opening goal. 7Fabian Delph Leeds lad gave a good account of himself at home and moved\u0026nbspseamlessly into a deep midfield role. 7Marcus Rashford\u0026nbsp(pictured) Staked claim to a starting spot in Russia with\u0026nbspblistering performance and scored terrific opener. 8Jamie Vardy Missed a chance to double the lead and only touched\u0026nbspball eight times in first half before being subbed on the hour. 5SubstitutesDanny Welbeck\u0026nbsp(on for Vardy) Ever-reliable forward came off the bench and made an impact with\u0026nbsping header from close range. 7Kieran Trippier\u0026nbsp(on for Alexander-Arnold) Should have done better from set pieces after coming on\u0026nbspbut seems likely to get a starting spot. 6Gary Cahill\u0026nbsp(on for Stones) Did not have much to do but was vocal and Southgate may be swayed by his valuable experience. 6Jesse Lingard\u0026nbsp(on for Loftus-Cheek) Only had 10 minutes to impress but came close to scoring straight away and looked lively again. 6\u0026nbspDele Alli\u0026nbsp(on for Henderson) Energetic when he came on, linking up well once again with Lingard and crossing for Welbeck\u0027s goal. 7Nick Pope (on for Butland)\u0026nbspIs unlikely to feature at all in Russia but given his England debut by Southgate, who has done so well in harvesting team spirit. 6– Ratings by Martha Kelner– Submit your own ratings at the bottom of the match reportThe encouraging part for Southgate is that, throughout his entire squad, there is not a single player who could be accurately described as off-form. Danny Welbeck, the only outfield player not to have started either of England’s last two games, was brought on just after the hour and, within 15 minutes, he had doubled the lead with a close-range header. Trent Alexander-Arnold acquitted himself well on his first international appearance, operating as a right-sided wing-back, and there was also a debut for Burnley’s Nick Pope, England’s third-choice goalkeeper, when he replaced Jack Butland during the second half.Jordan Henderson, who captained the side in Harry Kane’s absence, played with considerable authority – the choice between Henderson and Eric Dier increasingly looks like one of Southgate’s tougher decisions – and the only disappointment, perhaps, was that Jamie Vardy found it difficult to impress.The Leicester striker managed only eight touches in the opening half and was substituted after 61 minutes. He could not take his best chance with a spinning close-range effort and, by the end of the night, he might have been forgiven for wondering if he had fallen back in the pecking order of front players.Rashford, on the other hand, was electric, a frequent menace to the Costa Rica defence and clearly emboldened by scoring a 13th-minute goal from the kind of angle and distance, almost 30 yards out, that would have put off many players in the same position. His contact with the ball was delivered in a way that many players of his generation have copied from Cristiano Ronaldo, striking it with great power but in a way that is deliberately designed to make his shot dip late on, almost like a beach ball, in the final part of its trajectory.This one was aimed diagonally, right to left, and started off so high it gave the goalkeeper, Keylor Navas, no chance of reaching it. The ball finished in the top right-hand corner and it is fair to say the Leeds supporters in the Don Revie Stand who had booed Rashford’s name when the teams were read out – along with that of Phil Jones, another Manchester United player – changed their tune for the remainder of the evening. Well, until Jesse Lingard was brought on.Rashford had shown early on that he was in the mood, eluding one of the Costa Rica centre-halves, Kendall Waston, with a lovely piece of deceptive skill on the byline, but he was not the only England player to catch the eye. Loftus-Cheek’s link-up play was another prominent feature and Delph, a more accomplished player than many people appear to realise, looked comfortable occupying a more advanced midfield role than his usual position at Manchester City. Rashford was the obvious choice for the man-of-the-match award but Delph – one of five Yorkshiremen in England’s starting XI – would have had reasonable grounds otherwise.Costa Rica are 23rd in Fifa’s world rankings – only 11 places back from England – but they were overwhelmed by the energy of their opponents in the first half. It was a tepid display from los Ticos and, unlike during the Nigeria game, Southgate’s team did not relinquish their superiority after the interval.Butland had a relatively stress-free evening before making way for Pope and Southgate could also reflect on several other chances for England, most notably when Navas kept out Henderson’s 20-yard drive and Harry Maguire’s header was cleared off the goalline from a corner. Dele Alli, another second-half substitute, supplied the cross for England’s second goal. Rashford was also involved and Welbeck added the finishing touch with a stooping header."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4deebfcab0331e667de17e0a1e6f2bcf8aff4563/5_172_5083_3050/master/5083.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e51cab5631793dd61a1db6e2ec4ef89","title":"england marcus rashford costa rica plan b","story":"And so on to the banks of the Baltic. Nobody ever really knows what to make of games such as these, the final demob‑happy friendlies of a tournament summer.At the end of an energetic 2-0 defeat of a forgettable Costa Rica England’s players waved a farewell to the far corners of Elland Road. From here they will travel east for their opening World Cup fixture in 10 days’ time unbeaten in 10 games, and with a leer of quiet confidence beneath the usual deflationary bluster.This was a productive run-out for a starting team of Plan Bs and second-choicers, with enough attacking vim in the shape of Marcus Rashford and Ruben Loftus-Cheek to suggest their early opponents in Group G may be harried by similar ferreting energy.Most obviously there was Rashford, who produced a goal that will live long in the memory for anyone staring down its line of flight. Beyond that there were some wonderfully bold moments as a mobile, tricksy centre-forward, completely overshadowing Jamie Vardy, who touched the ball eight times to Rashford’s 49 in the first half.Loftus-Cheek must be the best option now if Southgate needs to alter the tempo or unsettle a defence with something more subtle. This is change in itself. In the past a Plan B for England has only ever meant a tall, aggressive man with a square jaw and flailing elbows. This time around B looks to be craft and movement, a footballer who looks to jab and move and tickle you to death rather than launching the footballing equivalent of an RAF stealth bombing raid.On a lovely summer evening there was also evidence of the usual meticulous planning by the FA.

The atmosphere was subtly different to Wembley, the key point of contrast being that there was one. From the first whistle those angular corrugated stands were a noise funnel of songs and cheers, notwithstanding the parping racket of the dreaded England band.Best of all was the startling noise that greeted Rashford’s opening goal after 12 minutes, a bark of pleasure as the ball was sent dipping under the bar and into the top of the net. The goal was pretty much all Rashford’s work, a wonderfully executed example of the knuckleball-style shot from Cristiano Ronaldo’s Old Trafford playbook. Taking the ball in an inside-right position he had time to plant his standing foot and punt the top of his toe through the bottom of the ball, sending his shot on a strange dipping parabola over Keylor Navas, who could only wave it vaguely into his net like a man watching the last late-night cab disappear round the corner of Wellington Street while absent-mindedly cradling a kebab.Loftus-Cheek had been the supplier with a snappy short pass that will register as an assist. It was Rashford’s fizzed pass inside that gave Dele Alli space to dink a short‑range cross for Danny Welbeck to e and head in off the post for the second, defying his own best effort to e and head just past the far post. Welbeck now has 16 goals in 39 England games, only 25 of them starts. Only 15 out-and-out centre-forwards have scored more goals for the national team since England started playing football 147 years ago. Rashford produced plenty of other nice moments, most notably a beautifully impudent, Ronaldinho‑style elastico‑flap, easing the ball one way then twanging it back the other to burn Giancarlo González away in his thrusters.There was something heartening about seeing him play with such freedom so soon after the scolding he received on FA Cup final day. Gareth Southgate has been a significant positive influence. Say what you like about Southgate’s lack of what the great José will always refer to as “titles”. But he does know how to get the best out of Rashford. He was helped by the poverty of the opposition. Costa Rica were muscular and dogged here. That was about it. At the back Kendall Waston moved with all the limber athleticism of the cast‑bronze Don Revie statue outside Elland Road.But England will still move on with a little hope. There is a refreshing energy to the team and plenty of speed across the ground. The challenge, as ever, is to play above rather than below their capacities when the pressure bites. And to provide, as Rashford did here, just a little touch of beauty after those recent tournament scars.Jack Butland Surprisingly given the nod ahead of Jordan Pickford\u0026nbspbut the Stoke keeper made a couple of decent stops. 7Phil Jones Did little wrong but did not come under much pressure and\u0026nbspalways sense he could drop a clanger. 6John Stones Only player to start both warm-up games but gave the ball\u0026nbspaway a couple of times. 6Harry Maguire\u0026nbspLucky to get away with it on two occasions when Joel Campbell got in behind him. 6Trent Alexander-Arnold\u0026nbspUnlikely to oust Kieran Trippier for a starting\u0026nbspspot in Russia but the youngest player in the squad coped well. 7Jordan Henderson Wore the captain\u0027s armband and constantly looked to press the opposition – but Southgate may prefer Eric Dier. 7Danny Rose\u0026nbspShowed enormous bravery off the pitch this week and started\u0026nbspbrightly but was disappointing in second half. 6Ruben Loftus-Cheek Linked up well with Henderson and\u0026nbspprovided the assist for Rashford\u0027s opening goal. 7Fabian Delph Leeds lad gave a good account of himself at home and moved\u0026nbspseamlessly into a deep midfield role. 7Marcus Rashford\u0026nbsp(pictured) Staked claim to a starting spot in Russia with\u0026nbspblistering performance and scored terrific opener. 8Jamie Vardy Missed a chance to double the lead and only touched\u0026nbspball eight times in first half before being subbed on the hour. 5SubstitutesDanny Welbeck\u0026nbsp(on for Vardy) Ever-reliable forward came off the bench and made an impact with\u0026nbsping header from close range. 7Kieran Trippier\u0026nbsp(on for Alexander-Arnold) Should have done better from set pieces after coming on\u0026nbspbut seems likely to get a starting spot. 6Gary Cahill\u0026nbsp(on for Stones) Did not have much to do but was vocal and Southgate may be swayed by his valuable experience. 6Jesse Lingard\u0026nbsp(on for Loftus-Cheek) Only had 10 minutes to impress but came close to scoring straight away and looked lively again. 6\u0026nbspDele Alli\u0026nbsp(on for Henderson) Energetic when he came on, linking up well once again with Lingard and crossing for Welbeck\u0027s goal. 7Nick Pope (on for Butland)\u0026nbspIs unlikely to feature at all in Russia but given his England debut by Southgate, who has done so well in harvesting team spirit. 6– Ratings by Martha Kelner– Submit your own ratings at the bottom of the match report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/322d4e779f640b72d608276e1326a4831eb0c55a/87_43_4927_2956/master/4927.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90d1b7e72b90dd5ee8ee297076cd9e6d","title":"liverpool set to complete signing nabil fekir lyon","story":"• Deal to go through on Friday after Liverpool meet valuation• France international follows Fabinho and Naby Keita to AnfieldLiverpool are set to complete the signing of Nabil Fekir on Friday after meeting Lyon’s €60m (£53m) valuation of the France international.Fekir is on the verge of becoming Jürgen Klopp’s second major transfer of the summer, with Anfield officials having agreed a deal worth an initial €55m to the French club plus €5m in bonuses.

They have also registered interest in Xherdan Shaqiri, who is available for £12m-£13.5m after Stoke City’s relegation from the Premier League.Bayern Munich and Atlético Madrid have also been linked with Fekir, who can operate in a number of forward roles and would in effect be Philippe Coutinho’s replacement at Anfield.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic retired from international football after Euro 2016 and they were then drawn with France and the Netherlands in their World Cup qualifying group. However, Sweden finished second in their group and went on to eliminate Italy in the play-offs.It was not pretty but it was effective and it is probably fair to say that the team have re-won the hearts of the Swedish people. For so many years it was all about Ibrahimovic but this team have gone back to the hard-working ethic that saw them qualify for a string of tournaments during the 2000s and reach the quarter-finals of Euro 2004.True, then they had three players of outstanding quality – Ibrahimovic, Fredrik Ljungberg and Henrik Larsson – whereas this time only RB Leipzig’s Emil Forsberg comes close to being described as a “star”. And that is partly why their success has been so cheered back home. To witness the centre-back Andreas Granqvist (who had an unsuccessful spell at Wigan) and the midfielder Seb Larsson (previously in the Premier League but now in the Championship with Hull City) withstand the Italian onslaught in the second leg was magnificent. In qualification Sweden’s main strength was the defence with Granqvist paired with Manchester United’s Victor Lindelöf in central defence. Granqvist was the leader and was voted Swedish player of the year in 2017, the first player to usurp Zlatan since 2006. The only real worry in defence is on the left side, where Sweden struggled at times in qualifying because of Forsberg’s attacking instincts exposed the left-back Ludwig Augustinsson.In attack, it is important for the team to find Ola Toivonen, who likes to drop deep and then pick out the runs of Forsberg and Marcus Berg. Another attacking ploy for Sweden under the coach, Janne Andersson, is for the wingers, usually Forsberg and Viktor Claesson, to move inside to give the full-backs space to advanceSweden lack creativity in central midfield, especially if Hamburg’s Albin Ekdal is injured, which he has been a lot recently. A front two of Toivonen and Berg lacks the charisma of Ibrahimovic but they do know each other well and have played together in various youth teams since they were 14 years old. “We have a philosophy that we are working with the players on and that does not change depending on who we are playing,” says Andersson. “Basically, we need to prepare well, be well organised and have a bloody good attitude in Russia.”Which player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup?Viktor Claesson is not a big name but could be a revelation in Russia, where he plies his trade at Krasnodar. Very quick, he has scored regularly from midfield this season. Which player is likely to disappoint?It could be Ola Toivonen, who, despite being a key player for Sweden, does not feature regularly for his club side Toulouse. Will time finally catch up with the 31-year-old in Russia?What is the realistic aim for Sweden at the World Cup? Having Germany in the group probably means that Sweden are fighting for second place. With Mexico and South Korea the other two teams in Group F, it is certainly not impossible to qualify but there is also no pressure on Sweden to do so. Reaching the last 16 would be a very good result. Andréas Sundberg writes for fotbollskanalen.se.Follow him on Twitter here.

While there, he was arrested and imprisoned by police, who confiscated his memory cards, phone and laptopSlavery has a long history in this north African desert nation. For centuries, Arabic-speaking Moors raided African villages, resulting in a rigid caste system that still exists to this day, with darker-skinned inhabitants beholden to their lighter-skinned “masters”. Slave status is passed down from mother to child, and anti-slavery activists are regularly tortured and detained. Yet the government routinely denies that slavery exists in Mauritania, instead praising itself for eradicating the practice.Members of Mauritania’s leading anti-slavery organisation, the Initiative for the Resurgence of the Abolitionist Movement (IRA), hope to oust the majority Arab-Berber government in national elections next year. The IRA leader, Biram Ould Abeid – a former slave who was imprisoned for years before coming second in 2014’s national elections – has vowed to remove President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, who came to power in a 2008 coup and has since dismantled the Senate in what critics see as a bid to broaden his powers.Fatimatou and her daughter Mbarka, above, were slaves to a family in the Aleg region, roughly 250km from the capital, Nouakchott. “They called me ‘Fatma the servant’: I looked after the cattle, prepared food, and fetched water from the well,” says Fatimatou. “I lost two babies to this family because they prevented me from taking care of my own children. I was forced to work when I had just given birth.” Fatimatou was freed with her children in the early 1990s by the organisation SOS Slaves. Today, she lives with her family in one of Nouakchott’s working-class neighbourhoods.Former slaves Habi and her brother Bilal, above left, stand in front of Bilal’s garage outside Nouakchott. The siblings were both slaves to a family east of the capital, but Bilal fled suddenly one day after his master beat him. After several attempts to rescue his sister, who was a victim of sexual abuse and forced labour, she was finally freed with the help of SOS Slaves in 2008. Today, the pair live in a poor neighbourhood on the periphery of Nouakchott. With the help of some activists, Bilal recently opened a small tyre-mounting garage.Mauritania is a bridge between the Arab Maghreb of north Africa and darker-skinned sub-Saharan Africa. The ruling Arab-Berbers have higher paid positions in jobs and government, while the darker-skinned Haratines and Afro-Mauritanians are under-represented in leadership positions and face many obstacles in society, from access to education to well-paid jobs.Haratines do many jobs that Arab-Berbers consider dirty or degrading, such as working in local markets. Sos Slaves provides workshops to help empower Haratine women, most of whom are unemployed, poor and have little or no education. Some workshops teach recently freed slaves about money – what it is and how it is used – while others teach Haratine women skills such as embroidery or sewing, which help them to earn money for the first time in their lives.Mabrouka, 20, was a child when she was taken from her mother, also a slave, to serve with a family in the south-western Rosso area. Around the age of 11, when she was cooking for her masters, she was badly burned on her left arm. She still suffers from the pain. Mabrouka was 14 when she was freed in 2011, but was never able to go to school. She got married at the age of 16 and is now the mother of Meriem, four, and two-month-old Khadi.A Tarhil neighborhood resident outside her house, where she was relocated by the state when her slum in Dar Naim was demolished to make way for the construction of a road. Married, with two children, she sells biscuits to passersby while her husband holds small jobs in the city. “If we had the budget, we would have rented a room in Nouakchott. Here, we don’t even have water – we have to pay for a cart to deliver water,” she says.Haratines work in certain professions that are designated for their caste alone, such as butchery and rubbish collection. Above, on the left, men at a slaughterhouse prepare cattle for sale in Nouakchott. The picture on the right shows Youssef, 18, who is in his third year of secondary school in Nouakchott. A few days a week he works as a rubbish collector to help support his family.Moctar was born into slavery in an Arab-Berber family, where he was forced to work alongside his mother and brother. In 2012, after several attempts, he managed to escape and met an activist from the anti-slavery movement. He tried to liberate his mother and brother, but they refused to go with him. His mother even criticised his escape and testified against him. “When I was younger, my mother told me every night that we must respect our masters, because their caste is higher than ours, and they are saints,” says Moctar. He started school at 13 and hopes to become a lawyer, in order to fight for the rights of the Haratines.Meryem (in blue) lives in Znabeh, a small village comprised of former slaves. In 2014, following the death of their father, the children of slavemaster Sheikh Mohammed freed four women and their children: Meryem, Aïcha, Beïga, and Merine. They all fled with their children and grandchildren and settled near a water source. They now survive off of their small holding and the little food it brings.Salma, above right, served for more than 50 years as a slave in a white Moorish family in northern Mauritania’s Chagar region. Her children were also born into servitude.In 2013, Salma and her daughter Yema were released by her two sons, Bilal and Salek (pictured above), who had escaped a few years earlier. But Yema twice ran back to her master’s family. Today, she is married and has two children. Salma, Yema and her brothers now live together in a slum in Dar Naim.Aichetou Mint M’barack was a slave by descent in the Rosso area. Like her sister, she was taken away from her mother and then given to a member of the master’s family to be a servant. She got married in the home of her masters and had eight children, two of whom were taken away from her to be slaves in other families. In 2010, Aichetou’s older sister was able to free her with the help of the IRA Movement, after she herself fled her masters when they poured hot embers over her baby, killing it. Aichetou and her eight children are now free and live together in Nouakchott.Jabada, below, is over 70. She fled her master after he tied both her hands to a tentpole, which cut off one finger entirely and deformed the others. She is now unable to use her hands. Taken in by another family who helped heal her wounds, Jabada stayed with them until her freedom in the 1980s. She now lives with her children and grandchildren in one of Nouakchott’s poor neighbourhoods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/333257b4c6ed496dc2d34aed6deae03f7500d7ea/0_216_4071_2443/master/4071.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a47e652be68c8b666f4c2d25a57a8d3","title":"most lawyers recommended to be judges went to state schools data shows","story":"Figures for England and Wales show greater social mobility but racial ersity ‘not happening fast enough’Almost two-thirds of lawyers recommended to become judges in the past year attended state schools, according to the first social mobility statistics released by the judicial appointments commission (JAC).The figures for England and Wales suggest the judiciary may be undergoing a gradual transformation despite criticism that solicitors and those from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds are not making significant advances.Traditionally, most judges have come from the ranks of barristers but there is increasing resentment among solicitors that they find it far harder to make their way on to the bench.Andrea Coomber, director of the legal reform charity Justice, said: “While the statistics paint a more encouraging picture for appointments of women to the senior judiciary, the same can’t be said for BAME candidates and solicitors. “Barristers – not the most erse bunch – still dominate senior appointments. The concerns expressed in our report of last April remain alive including that there needs to be more shared accountability between the JAC and the judiciary to effect change.”Peter Herbert, the chair of the Society of Black Lawyers, said: “These statistics demonstrate that racial ersity in the judiciary is simply not happening fast enough. When a royal wedding ceremony demonstrates greater racial ersity than our justice system something is badly wrong. “We urge the minister of justice to adopt clear targets for the recruitment, retention and promotion of BME judges and magistrates. A judicial ‘Rooney rule’ should be adopted so that every BME candidate who fits the criteria must be interviewed. “These are some of the basic measures necessary that will help to ensure the judiciary and magistracy truly represents the erse society they serve.”Christina Blacklaws, the vice-president of the Law Society, which represents solicitors across England and Wales, said: “Without doubt the skills solicitors develop in practice are more and more relevant to the changing court environment.“Many solicitors demonstrate the expertise needed to be an effective judge: intellect, the ability to be fair and even-handed, authority, and advanced communications skills.“The solicitor profession has a vital part to play ensuring our world-renowned judiciary is as erse as the society it serves and I would encourage all solicitors to consider whether a judicial role might be right for them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc3088e816602c5d57f572a10882f6c68c52450c/0_0_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=829c2e70d7a9973a7e243204c86e8b33","title":"jezfest labour live ticket sales so slow giving away","story":"Ticket sales for Labour Live have been so slow that they are now being given away. Just another reminder for party members: participating in capitalism always gets you screwed overHow has Lost in Showbiz left it this late before focusing on Labour Live, the Labour party’s political-rally-cum-music-festival-cum-arts-event-cum-friendly-bombs? During the EU referendum, I seem to remember getting a full two columns out of Bpop Live, the concert to promote Brexit, featuring the sounds of Nigel Farage and Phats and Small – and that event never even happened. Another mixture of speakers and musical acts, some of whom had not lost court battles to trade under their own name, Bpop Live was pulled after failing to fill much past row B of the Genting Arena in Birmingham. The trouble with these political concerts is you need to make the offering really enticing, or you are left with a bit of a horror show. It’s not Bestival it’s Worstival.No such fate awaits Labour Live, which will be going ahead at White Hart Lane recreation ground on 16\u0026nbspJune even if Len McCluskey has to rush in a one-member, one-free-ticket ruling. Have you got tickets, which were priced at £35? What do you mean: “It’s literally the first Saturday of the World Cup and – shoot me if you like – I’d rather watch\u0026nbspFrance and then the Argies than John McDonnell”? That’s crazy\u0026nbsptalk.Admittedly, the event is perceived as having run into a few problems, not least the lineup. There was rather a lot of hype around Labour Live when it was announced, suggesting it would be the biggest and most slickly stage-managed political rally since any of the ones it’s tasteful to mention. Following Jeremy Corbyn’s very well-received appearance at Glastonbury last summer, it was expected that Labour could bring together some of the biggest entertainment properties in the Corbynverse – a sort of Infinity Rally featuring Stormzy and Lily Allen and whatnot.That was then. For whatever reason, Labour Live’s headliners are now the Magic Numbers (ask yer dad). Incredible, really, to think of the sheer volume of agents who have told their Corbyn-supporting clients that they are simply NOT doing this. I wonder what lies they have told? “No one but no one wants you to appear at this more than me, but the record company just won’t have it. It’s heartbreaking, but my hands are\u0026nbsptied.”Still, Jermain Jackman will be there, and Hookworms, and Reverend and the Makers (again, your dad can help), and the gig will obviously feat. Jeremy Corbyn. So the situation could be a lot worse. The problem with anti-EU concert Bpop Live was all the booked artistes pulling out when they discovered it was an anti-EU concert. This will not be the case with Labour Live. Pretty sure that when my colleague Owen Jones says he is going to be somewhere, he honours his commitment – unlike East 17 or the two remaining members of 5ive, who binned off Bpop Live when it started to look like a shitter.Even so, there are whispers that Labour could be in for a big financial hit on the event, never mind the PR awks of a sparsely filled venue. To this end, none other than Unite boss McCluskey has had to step in to get the show back on track, which – creatively – feels akin to the moment Bob Geldof got promoter Bill Graham on board for the US side of Live Aid.Indeed, it’s a shame Labour Live can’t avail itself of someone with even a hundredth of the talent and soul of the legendary and extraordinary Graham, who always spoke with wistful power of the cultural moment of 70s rock, where the possibility of immense change felt real and within the grasp of a generation. Then again, instinct suggests there are – how to put this? – other aspects of contempo Labour discourse that would have put Graham right off association with them.Anyway, they have got Len instead, which in one sense isn’t weird – he already has form as a mood-music promoter. As for his strategy on this occasion, Unite announced a couple of weeks ago that it is giving away 1,000 tickets and would even organise free transport to the event. Since then, Labour HQ has made further offers of free tickets to constituency Labour parties, along with promises to lay on transport. And this week, the Labour party announced: “We’re offering a limited number of £10 tickets to under-27s. But you’ve got to be quick!”Of course you have. Like the saying goes: the early bird catches the people who bought early bird tickets. “Is there a process to try and reclaim costs?” one irked Labour supporter wondered on Twitter. “I’ve spent £70 on two tickets.”There isn’t, alas. As a Labour spokeswoman told the Observer last Sunday: “Labour Live is one of the ways we’re continuing to open up politics to a wider audience and spread Labour’s message about how we can build a society that works for the many, not the few.”It certainly works for the many who are being given free tickets – but arguably less so for the few who paid actual money for them. I hope the latter group of suckers learns their lesson: participating in capitalism always gets you screwed over, while waiting for a free handout builds a concert we can all be proud of. I\u0026nbspalso hope the person in charge of this eccentric ticketing process will be chief secretary to the Treasury within four years.So there you have it. We have not yet got to the stage of needing to put on a concert to save the concert, but there is a clear sense that the Labour press office would now literally rather talk about the realities of their Brexit position than Labour Live.However, anti-Corbyn elements should not be tempted to fall into any traps with this one. Those seeking to extrapolate Corbyn’s electoral prospects should avoid reading anything whatsoever from Labour Live’s ticket sales data. After all, as mentioned, Brexit couldn’t sell out a Birmingham arena during the referendum campaign itself, but – yes, here it comes – just look what it’s selling out now!Exciting news this week for the #MeToo movement, which has caught the eye of the man who for so long was the holy grail of aspirational Hollywood actors.For decades, working with Woody Allen was always the greatest honour for any movie star, until – basically overnight – it wasn’t. Indeed, the director’s insistence on making an estimated 12 films a year meant that a couple of movies were still in post-production when the deluge of voices suddenly saying they would never work with him again broke. This left the stars of those movies in the odd position of being contractually obliged to promote the very same forthcoming films for which they were already apologising for appearing in.Whatever. The director himself has other fish to fry. “I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement,” explained Allen this week. “Because I have worked in movies for 50 years. I’ve worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one — big ones, famous ones, ones starting out — have ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all. I’ve always had a wonderful record with them.”Well. I don’t think any women’s movement can really be regarded as having made it until a man wants to be its figurehead – and if the ladies of #MeToo are serious about taking this to the next level, they should do more than just place these peerless credentials on file."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8657dc8555ff6903caad0a9ac22c55c8dc4b256c/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=34ad02e6e15f9ec6bec7e829c4e61d52 1320w","title":"jorja smith lost found review","story":"Most people will know Jorja Smith either by voice, thanks to her sunny R\u0026ampB vocals on Drake’s Get It Together, or by face, thanks to her many magazine covers, five-storey high billboard campaigns and fashion brand endorsements. Others in the music industry will know her as Bruno Mars’s tour support, and Kendrick Lamar’s co-writer on I Am from the Black Panther soundtrack. After a clutch of singles and a Brits critics’ choice award, this pop-R\u0026ampB debut album is her proper introduction as a solo artist, working it all out in real time as we listen in.The highlights include Wandering Romance, where, between bass stabs, she wholly exposes her desire and frustration. You can almost see her face writhe as she belts: “No one keeps me dirty like you do … so take it how you want it, take all my love.” The effect is rousing, to say the least.The delicate yearning on February 3rd hears her begging someone to “lose themselves from playing games”, conjuring those raw moments of trying to make a lover commit. On Lifeboats (Freestyle) she ponders “so why are the richest in floats and all my brothers drowning?” over gentle piano lines and soft hums – she channels Estelle’s cockney conversation, but without quite matching her finesse. The album can sound laboured, and not just lyrically. You can feel her voice strain and contort even in the first few notes of the opening track, where she walks on the edge of the overly saccharine, only to eventually crash to a fall with Tomorrow (“Don’t you wonder why  I won’t say goodbye  I won’t even cry.”)Lost \u0026amp Found is a well-paced album full of gentle vocals, catchy pop hooks and a playful relationship with the pains of youth, love and insecurity. Smith’s voice moves between arrestingly husky and overly nasal, with plenty of room to develop, but the sparse and uninspiring production doesn’t save the songs from feeling forgettable at times. As far as the poetry of trying, failing and picking yourself up again goes, this has merit, but as for staking a claim as pop’s biggest new R\u0026ampB talent, it doesn’t quite stand five stories tall."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f86690808e0b03c42f3418a7e8da04e644adceb/0_66_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5722a9ef922918e6766fe133767bf4a4","title":"lost 1963 john coltrane album discovered","story":"An album of previously unheard original compositions by the legendary jazz saxophonist has been discovered, 55 years after its recordingA lost album of originals by John Coltrane, the American saxophonist who took jazz to new heights of freedom and expression, has been unearthed.The album, being released on 29 June as Both Directions at Once: the Lost Album, was recorded in a session on 6 March 1963, at the Van Gelder studios in New Jersey. Joining Coltrane in the quartet that also recorded classic albums such as A Love Supreme, Coltrane, and Ballads, are Jimmy Garrison on double bass, Elvin Jones on drums, and McCoy Tyner on piano. The master tape left in the studio was lost, and it’s likely it was destroyed in the early 70s when the label, Impulse!, was trying to reduce storage fees. But Coltrane gave his own reference tape of the recording to his wife Naima, despite their then disintegrating relationship – the pair orced in 1966, and the tape has stayed in her family’s possession ever since.Sonny Rollins, a peer of Coltrane’s and also regarded as one of the greatest jazz saxophonists of all time, described the discovery as “like finding a new room in the Great Pyramid”.Among the seven tracks are two completely unheard original compositions, called Untitled Original 11383 and Untitled Original 11386, both of which are played on soprano saxophone. Another composition, One Up, One Down, has been heard only in a live bootleg from the Birdland jazz club, and never before in this studio version.The sessions capture Coltrane at a crucial juncture in his music. It was still two years before Ascension, where he opened up his quartet into an experimental, spiritually minded big band, but he was already heading towards its “free jazz” sound. Impressions (1963), recorded across the previous two years, features some unmoored and raw soloing quite different from the previous bebop era. Nevertheless, he was still in love with melody: Ballads, recorded during the same period and also released in 1963, features some of his most accessible material. The 11386 recording similarly sees the quartet play in a traditional style, revisiting a melodic chorus theme between solos, and the album also features Coltrane’s first, never before heard version of Nat King Cole’s Nature Boy – unlike the freer 1965 version, the Both Directions at Once version is a straight three-minute take without solos. Ben Ratliff, former New York Times jazz writer and author of Coltrane: the Story of a Sound, told the : “This is Coltrane’s quartet starting to move into the last stages of their stable and authoritative phase, when they were often playing the same handful of songs. There’s no concept or grand design here. But he’s trying some new tunes, and playing a strange blues, and fine-tuning Impressions – and that’s a lot.”Both Directions at Once was recorded at an intensely fertile time for Coltrane and his quartet – as well as Ballads and Impressions, he also released a collaboration with Duke Ellington in 1963. The lost session was recorded during a two-week run of shows at Birdland – Coltrane played the club straight after the session – and the following day, 7 March, he recorded the album John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman with the jazz singer (its tracklisting changed on the way to the studio, after the pair heard Nat King Cole singing Lush Life on the radio and decided to include their own version).Saxophonist Wayne Shorter, interviewed for the album’s liner notes, says the title Both Directions at Once came from a compositional tip Coltrane gave to him: “about starting a sentence in the middle, and then going to the beginning and the end of it at the same time.” ’s jazz critic John Fordham finds another meaning: “Coltrane was looking back at bebop – the virtuosity and melodic resources of which he had stretched to breaking point – and the song-based lyricism of jazz he had recently explored with Duke Ellington, and was about to with Johnny Hartman. But he was also looking forward to imagining the more intense, mantra-like, spiritually-driven music that produced A Love Supreme in 1964.”British jazz and improv saxophonist Evan Parker meanwhile told the : “This release is most welcome – the ‘classic quartet’ was where Coltrane did his best work.” He picked out Coltrane’s interplay with drummer Elvin Jones as being “the core of the music ... which reached astonishing levels of intuitive understanding.”Ratliff adds that “most of all, Both Directions at Once is a study in how seriously strong the band was, and how powerful his intent, or his concentration, had become.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/843ae6dcd8ba6993b9776e7085b0d3cc13982943/130_0_3900_2340/master/3900.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36f27eef00fb53451677cae21d4fecde","title":"gypsy damian le bras road traveller roots","story":"It is Friday night. I’m 30 years old, alone on a fake-fur blanket in the back of a cold Transit van. Most of my generation are out there in pubs, or indoors by the telly, canoodling, arguing or cooking, or going across to the thermostat to turn the heating up. I’m parked on a Cornish industrial estate with no warmth except the tiny, wavering plume of heat that rises out of my lantern. This place is so lonesome that even the doggers, boy-racers and stoners have spurned it. I curse myself silently. You’re not a Traveller, my mate, you’re a . What sort of Traveller would come and sleep here on their own? I have covered thousands of miles in my van in a bid to uncover the history of Gypsy Britain. But the road is proving tough.Gypsy reality is partly composed of fairgrounds and showgrounds, picturesque lakeside halts, sheltered commons, bright heaths. But it also comprised frozen copses and hilltops. Old maintenance roads with potholes and bad light. Scrapyards. Council waste ground. Lay-bys near the edges of tips. Slag-heaps and drained marshes. Fen ends. Chalk pits, yards and quarries. These are the stopping places, these fringes and in-between places. They are the places that nobody lives except Travellers – or nobody but those who share ancient connections with them: gamekeepers and poachers, scrap-metal men, horsewomen, rangers and shepherds. They are the old nomads’ haunts of the island. Many are smashed and built over some – magically – are still more or less just as they were in centuries long past. They form the hidden Gypsy and Traveller map of the country we live in: they are the bedrock of our reality and, perhaps, the antidote to the unending cycles of romanticisation and demonisation.I had conceived a plan to visit these places, to live in them in my own way, and see what I might learn. Perhaps I might even solve the bizarre contradiction of Britain’s love affair with caravanning, camping and glamping, and its hatred of those who were born to this life, and who largely inspired its adoption as a non-Gypsy pastime. As one Scottish Gypsy Traveller put it: “There are 80,000 members of the Caravan Club, but I’m not allowed to travel?”There is more to this Gypsy geography than a list of physical places. The stopping places themselves are an outgrowth of something non-physical, something that is ancient, unseen yet important, precious and reviled, envied and feared. This thing is the Gypsy belief – the core belief of the culture – that it is possible to live in a different way: in your own way, part of the world, but not imprisoned by the rules. That you can know the ropes and yet not be hemmed in by them. That you can dwell alongside the mainstream, while not being part of it. Otter-like, you can live in the bank of the river and swim and hunt there when you need to, and then climb back out with equal ease and alacrity. There is no better symbol of this belief than the network of atchin tans (stopping places) laced across Britain they are historical, topographical proof that the Gypsy philosophy has existed here, that it still does, that it still can. By staying at the traditional stopping places, I hoped to answer the questions that had been following me, on and off, all my life. What is left of these places? What might we learn from them? What redemption might lie there, in a country that still passes new legislation aimed at ending the Traveller way of life? Is it still possible to live on the road? Was the end of the old Gypsy life a tragedy, or was it a case of good riddance to an irredeemably hard and pitiless life on the edge? Above all, I hoped to resolve the biggest question: the question of myself, whether I could make my peace with Gypsy culture. My conflict seemed to echo the wider tension between nomads and settled people that endures in modern Britain.On the way to our regular pitch selling flowers in the marketplace in Petersfield, my elders would point and nod at empty spaces by the sides of the road, flat areas on verges and slightly raised banks, vacant pull-ins and lay-bys, and make comments as if there was something there, something I couldn’t see. They were glimmers of another world, but it felt as distant as the stars. I knew the places had something to do with the time they were “on the road” – most of my family were settled now, living in houses or caravans and mobile homes on private bits of land.Travellers I knew from the east of England had lived rough deep into the recent past, still working the farms into the 1990s. By then, it had been the best part of 50 years since anyone in my family had depended on that kind of work. So it came as a shock to meet Travellers younger than me who had grown up picking turnips in January. They described reaching down with a gloved hand and grabbing hold of the big, leafy tops, how it would sometimes send a plug of ice shooting upwards.Alongside selling flowers, my family had roofing and car-breaking businesses. We had a big field and a yard, a word that seemed to mean a place where all things might, and did, happen. Terriers, geese and perturbed-looking cockerels roamed in between the legs of cantankerous horses. Stables were stacked full of the musty paraphernalia of horsemanship, flower-selling, roofing and car respraying. Bits of cars lay everywhere, named as if they were the parts or clothes of people or animals: bonnets, boots, seats, wings, belts. There were brass-handled horsewhips, jangling harnesses, buckets of molasses-sprayed chaff and milled sugar-beet, bales of sweet-smelling fresh hay. But all of this old rustic stuff was stacked and wedged in among the hard and greasy gear of the family economy: gas bottles, blowtorches, leaky old engines, spray paint, rolls of lead, felt, and seemingly infinite stacks of every conceivable type of roof tile. A heavy boxing bag swung with barely perceptible creaks, keeping time in the half-light of the dusty old garage.There were caravans there that we sometimes lived in and out of, especially in the summer. We never considered this odd, even though we also had a big house on the land that my grandad had built with his men. And there always seemed to be heavy and dangerous things lying close to hand. The hard stuff of motion was everywhere, although we were settled: cars, tractors and trucks, some brand-new, others eaten by weather and time horses, ponies, traps, sulkies and carts scattered wheels and bolts from Ford and Bedford lorries. And, hung from a barn door like a pair of swords and scabbing to ochre with rust, there were two axles rescued from the ashes of the last wagon owned by our family.We had a name for ourselves: Travellers. In our case, it didn’t just mean anyone who travelled around, regardless of their race: to us it meant our people specifically, the Romanies of Britain. The first Romanies probably arrived on the British mainland towards the end of the 15th century, and had been a contentious presence ever since.Wherever the Gypsies went, they took with them their strange tongue, Romani, and it was through this that the mystery of their origins was solved. An 18th-century German linguist called Johann Rüdiger overheard Gypsies talking, and was struck by the similarity of their speech to Indian languages. Later linguists, including the so-called “Romany Ryes” – rye being the Romani word for a gentleman – such as the English writer George Borrow and the Irish academic John Sampson, would identify layers of borrowings from Persian, Slavic and Romance languages in the Gypsies’ speech, using these to trace a philological map of their long road into the West. English Romani had German-derived words in it, like nixis, meaning “nothing”, and fogel for “smell”.As for the name of the Romanies, it was derived from their own word for “man” or “husband”, rom, and it had nothing to do with Romania, which got its name from the Roman military camps which once filled its territory. The Gypsies called their language Romanes, an adverb meaning “like a rom”. To rokker Romanes meant, simply, to talk like a Gypsy and not like a gorjer – a non-Gypsy. The word gorjies comes from the old Romany word gadje or gadzhe, and though its form has mutated with time, its meaning is the same: the non-Gypsies, outsiders, the people-who-aren’t-us.Almost everyone who has studied Romani in Britain has remarked on how adept its speakers are at coming up with names for things. In some ways, talking Romanes means having to be constantly inventive and alert, both in terms of creating words and also interpreting the new ones that get spun off the cuff and thrown into daily Traveller conversation. There is no stigma attached to inventing words, as there so often is in English nor are new words looked down upon as annoying neologisms that we’d be better off without. Invented words are more likely to be smiled upon or chuckled at as evidence of a witty, intelligent mind one with a good and flexible grasp of the ancient Travellers’ tongue.Besides, if Romani is to retain one of the functions which has kept it alive thus far – and which it has in common with almost all minority languages – namely, to stop outsiders knowing what you are talking about, then it will always be necessary to invent new ways of saying things. According to a Belarusian Romany man I once met, a word is no longer a truly Romani word once its meaning becomes known amongst the gadzhe – it is useless, dead, and best left where it is. This is an extreme opinion, but it points to a common anxiety: that the language will lose its power if it becomes too widely known. Yet words come and go as they please, like mood and temper traded by friends, explained by lovers, and hurled across the fray. Every Gypsy who “gives away” the Romani language risks the accusation of treason.In the old Romany tradition, you can only call yourself a true Romany Gypsy – one of the kaulo ratti, the black blood – if all your ancestors, as far as you know, are of the tribe. I can trace my Romany ancestry back at least six generations I was brought up to know the Romani language to learn the old tales and to keep the Romanipen – the cleanliness taboos of the old-fashioned Gypsies. I was raised, and still live, in a Romany psychological realm a mental Gypsyland.I have both Gypsy and non-Gypsy blood and so, in many Travellers’ eyes, I do not have the right to call myself a true-bred Romany. It does not matter that there is no such thing as a racially pure Gypsy: over a 1,000-year migration it is virtually impossible that there will have been no mingling in the line. The mixing in my family had happened within living memory, and this meant I was at best a poshrat – a mixed-blood Gypsy – and at worst a “half-chat gorjie” or, as a friend once memorably put it, a “fucked-up half-breed”.I do not look like most people’s idea of a typical Gypsy, my blue eyes and fair hair belying my origins, my picture of myself. My identity was inside me and the outside didn’t match up. It imbued me with a tetchy defensiveness, and a resentment of people whom I then believed had simpler ethnicities: Scottish, Nigerian, Han.I felt so close to my roots, and especially to the Romany women who had brought me up – my mum her mother, Gran and Gran’s mother, Nan. But this seemed to count for little in a world which, for all its modernity, still believed in labels such as “half-caste”, “full-blood” and “mixed race”. Later, as a teenager, I started carrying photographs of darker-haired family members in my wallet, to challenge the disbelief of those who thought I was lying about my Romany background. I lived in a world that wasn’t sure if I really belonged in it, and so I wasn’t sure, either. Regardless, it was where I was. Our family were the mistrusted local Gypsies, the bane of the decent, upstanding parish council. We were “gyppos”, “pikeys”, “diddakois”, “them lot”. Locally, we were infamous. The ide was crystal clear.Compared with the insults and slurs, the words Romanies, Gypsies, and Travellers were dignified, and we used all of them interchangeably. The greater part of our family owned their own yards and bungalows, but the name Travellers still seemed to make sense. There were wheels everywhere, and we were always on hair-trigger alert to hook up trailers and go when the need arose: we drove miles for a living, and had family who lived on the road. Some places with links to the Travellers were not easily romanticised. The sides of the M1, the A1, the A303 and the M25 are peppered with modern-day atchin tans. They are sites with access to opportunities to earn money, and – being less desirable to non-Gypsies – also the sorts of locales where less cash is needed to set up a camp.Such places symbolise the misunderstood truth of many Traveller lives, which is that they are neither permanently nomadic, nor ever truly static. Howbeit, these yards provide a base, the highway is right beside them, ready for the times when family ties, work, a wedding, a funeral, the fair season, beckon. Councils refer to them as “sites close to the key regional transport corridors, favoured by Gypsies and Travellers”. Travellers call them :“Handy, being right by that main road”. Handy, yes, but still handcuffed to tragedy. Every family is haunted by stories of relatives, too often toddlers, who have been knocked down and killed by their literal closeness to roads.The word “Gypsy” wasn’t often heard back when I was a teenager. When it was, it was usually as part of a story about the old days, where someone had shouted out, “Dirty Gypsies!” and nine times out of 10 a fight had ensued, which the dirty Gypsies – who, in my grandad’s words, were “rough, tough and made out of the right stuff” – almost always won.In our world, arguments are often resolved by somebody leaving and the relationship being severed. If this doesn’t happen, then there will almost always be a fight. In the best-case scenario, it’ll just be a fair fist fight, nice and clean, one-on-one, with a referee to see fair play and as few spectators as possible to get sucked into the row. It can be between two men or two women: it’s usually men, but not always. These things are often organised quickly in a place right out of the way, so the law is unlikely to be an issue plus, some police officers I’ve spoken to even seem to have a laissez-faire stance on it, possibly because they have seen worse ways of ending a row than a bare-knuckle fight. Worst-case scenario, it will not be clean and it will not be fair, and the more people that get involved, the more likely that is. If weapons come into it, then the police are especially likely to show an interest.The proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674-1913 are speckled with references to London’s Gypsies and Travellers. There is a website that explains why they were “over-represented in the proceedings”: they formed part of “what many contemporaries considered a dangerous and crime-prone “residuum”’, which seeped back into the city at autumn following the end of the temporary farm work. It goes on, telling how “in a working-class mirror to the elite’s “London Season”, October and November saw hundreds and thousands of men, women and children returning to the capital from hop-picking and market gardening, from touring the fairs and tramping in search of work”. It was a yearly migration from the city to the countryside and back that continued, for some, right up to the 1950s.For all its flighty connotations, Gypsy culture can be stifling in its demands for living in line with its hidden rules. Rock stars employ “Gypsy” to mean those who have escaped from moral claustrophobia, but in reality, Gypsies are just as likely to feel confined as anybody else. In Glasgow, I watched as a troupe of little girls from the local Roma community danced in brightly coloured dresses at a community event. They clicked their fingers on outstretched arms and sang “Ja tuke tuke” to a furious klezmer beat. The audience clapped and twirled, unaware of the lyrics’ meaning: “Get away from me.”Nan talks of the old paradox that we have heard about all of our lives. The hardship of old times, versus the sense of togetherness that Travellers have lost. The gratitude for comforts that not long ago were undreamed of and unheard of, set against the moral corruption, unhappiness and constant malaise that have come from an overfast integration into the gorjies’ consumerist world.For centuries, politicians had guessed that if Gypsies could be settled in regular housing, then within a few short generations they would be just like everyone else. There would be no need for a word for outsiders, because we would be just like them. But that isn’t what has happened. Many Gypsies now live either in housing, or on permanent caravan sites, not in meadows or lanes or lay-bys or by the sides of old tips. And yet they are still what they are, changed in some ways, but different enough to draw the old line between themselves and the gorjies.I sometimes wonder what Nan thinks I am. Of course, I am her great-grandson, born from her line, flesh and blood. But I’m not what she calls a “true Traveller”. Aside from my mixed roots, I wasn’t born to that life: I arrived into a changed era, one of stability, stasis, hot running water, and Christmases stacked with teetering piles of presents. The Romany bloodline never dies out. But the life of the Traveller changes, sometimes so much so that you could forgive the outside world for thinking the people themselves have vanished.When I was small, Horsmonden in Kent was a typical Travellers’ horse fair. This meant that most people weren’t actually there for the horses. It’s true that a core of those who came, mostly men but quite a few women as well, were proper horse people. They came towing their boxes with strong cobs standing inside, tethered in the half-light their two-wheeled sulkies – light trotting carts with a seat big enough for one or two people – and their harness, head collars and whips. But people came from far and near to the fair, and most of them weren’t interested in any equine displays. If they were, then it was simply because they provided an authentic backdrop. What they were interested in depended on the inidual: but mostly, they were interested in each other. It is a quirk of our scatteredness: a few hundred thousand people at most, flecked across Britain’s damp islands, and we meet mostly at weddings, funerals and fairs. The horse trade has its ups and downs – as I write this, it’s down, the worst in my lifetime. But the horse fairs will persist, because their purpose goes beyond trade.When the days are hot and tanned skins gleam with sweat in the sun, it is clear once again that horse fairs are shop windows for young brides and husbands. They always have been. This much, at least, is gospel, and proudly announced to journalists and inquisitive souls who come asking questions about the culture. But not every dalliance ends in a marriage, and rumours occasionally flare of unauthorised, ultra-brief flings at the fringes of fairs: dangerous liaisons that lead to bad names, fights, or worse, feuds that run on and on.For the not so young, what they seek from each other is something subtler, less clear to outsiders, but an equally powerful draw. I suspect few would want to explain what it was, for fear of sapping its power by giving it voice. What the fairs offer is a chance to track the progress of our lives: to reminisce about previous years when we trod the same field, but equally to remark on how far we have come.We polish and dress up our lives for the day and compare them to the lives of others, affirming their context, confirming their meaning. The fairs are where we remind ourselves who we are. It’s not that we don’t keep being who we are in between – of course we do. But the fairs provide a special concentration of Traveller experience, a tincture of what it is to be a Gypsy. At a horse fair we get to see, just for one day, what life would be like if the world shared our Gypsy priorities.And then there are those who despise both horses and the fairs. For some families, the horse had its day a long time ago. I once asked my mate Charles if he and his family used to go to the fairs up north, which is where he comes from. He looked at me as though the question was perverse. “We don’t mind a day at the races, but Damian, can you see me or me dad, or any of us here, fucking about with horses? My great-great-grandad was a proper Gypsy man, and he was driving a Rolls-Royce a hundred year ago.”Traveller culture, preoccupied though it can be with bygone times, has always preferred the tangible: today’s bread, the here and the now. As Nan says, “You can only eat one meal at a time.” In the past, writers took this as evidence that Gypsies inhabited a “heroic present”, lacking a sense of history and living so sharply in the moment that concepts such as deferred gratification were lost on them. I have always dismissed such ideas as inherently dangerous: they are liable to slide into essentialism, and the belief that races have irreconcilable differences. But maybe in turning so sharply away from a lie, I lost sight of a truth: that the present holds a finer promise than the past with its shadows and dust. In an inversion of the obvious, perhaps even the Traveller obsession with cemetery maintenance itself supports this view. After all, isn’t the act of placing flowers on a tomb a gesture of bringing a little life back to the dead?After the fair at Horsmonden, I largely avoided gatherings of people, spending time in empty stopping places, visiting forlorn churches and well-kept graves. It is dawning on me that there is only so much I can learn from this. Another of Nan’s catchphrases comes to me: “There are no pockets in shrouds.” Perhaps this saying, a caution against overzealous pursuit of riches, masks a second meaning as well. There is a poverty to death a limit to how much a skeleton can teach you about a life it no longer knows.I realised how sparsely furnished my van was. Its naked pale blue surfaces stared at me like sheets of ice. For eight months, I had been travelling with what I thought were the bare essentials – bed, stove, wash gear, clothes and so forth. But there were other trappings of Romany life, when it was lived most richly: beautiful furnishings, gilded surfaces, portable pictures, talismans and silks. I’ve been missing a trick: the means by which a difficult life was rendered livable and even, at times, enviable.When I asked Mum for help, she looked happy, as if pleased that I’d finally grasped the meaning of life. She gave me armfuls of folded materials. There was an Islamic purple velvet hanging, edged with golden stitching and arranged in a pattern of teardrops matching Bedouin horse-cloths, constructed out of navy blue and orange-coloured diamond shapes of fabric brightly coloured Indian tapestry cloths: two square ones, and one in the shape of an arch. They shouted in bright yellows and blues and greens and pinks, with tiny mirrors stitched into them alongside little embroidered birds, stars, flowers, chakra wheels and Hindu swastikas. I decorated the van, clipping the cloths to the plywood lining with bulldog clips and larger, stronger, rubber-tipped market grips.The van was completely transformed. Its contents came together into a nomadic aesthetic all of its own ramshackle, yet somehow making happy sense as a whole. My gran and grandad – Mum’s parents – wandered over to see what I’d been doing. They seemed stunned, but in a good way: “Looks like an old vardo,” Grandad said, using the Traveller word for caravan. Gran remarked that the way I had hung the cloths reminded her of the inside of the Travellers’ square tents back when she was a little girl. Their approval came as a relief. I slammed the doors and smiled as I thought of the road ahead.• Follow the long read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.This is an edited extract from The Stopping Places by Damian Le Bas, published by Chatto \u0026amp Windus on 7 June.

All look the same in the tests performed.But whatever the ultimate source of the material, if microbial life did find a foothold on Mars, the presence of organics meant it would not have gone hungry. “We know that on Earth microorganisms eat all sorts of organics. It’s a valuable food source for them,” said Jennifer Eigenbrode, a biogeochemist at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.“While we don’t know the source of the material, the amazing consistency of the results makes me think we have a slam-dunk signal for organics on Mars,” Eigenbrode added. “It is not telling us that life was there, but it is saying that everything organisms really needed to live in that kind of environment, all of that was there.”The car-sized rover, which has trundled a careful 12 miles (19.3km) since it landed in the planet’s Gale crater nearly six years ago, detected a slew of organic molecules in pieces of Martian mudstone it drilled from the ancient lake bed and heated in its onboard oven. When the samples reached 500 to 820C, the rover’s instruments detected a range of so-called aromatic, aliphatic and thiophenic vapours. The science team believes these are breakdown products of even larger organic molecules, similar to those found in coal, which were trapped in the Martian rocks in the distant past.“To me it is amazing that we can show we have organic matter preserved for more than 3bn years in these rocks,” said Kirsten Siebach, a planetary geologist who was not involved in the work at Rice University in Houston, Texas. “This is very promising for the preservation of potential ancient life on the planet.”“These molecules could have been part of life, but they could also have been food for life,” Siebach added. “To know that the water really was full of organic molecules really opens up the different ways that life could have existed on Mars.”The Nasa rover has found hints of organics on the planet before. In 2015, mission scientists reported that Curiosity had detected whiffs of chlorine-containing organics in the planet’s rocks, but concerns over potential contamination and instrument glitches meant that the results did not convince everyone.The latest findings, reported in the journal Science, are far more compelling. According to Inge Loes ten Kate, a geologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, “the results convincingly show the long-awaited detection of organic compounds on Mars.”The discovery of organics in rocks mere centimetres beneath the Martian surface has raised hopes of finding richer deposits of the compounds deeper down. In those may lurk tell-tale signs of life itself, scientists say. “If we can find things like fatty acids, that would be the first potential hints of life,” said Eigenbrode.In a separate paper published in Science, another Nasa-led team describes Curiosity’s latest measurements of the Martian atmosphere. Before the rover touched down in August 2012, missions to the red planet had already spotted methane in the atmosphere which spiked from time to time as plumes of the gas apparently rose from the planet. The discovery fuelled speculation that the gas might be the expulsions of Martian microbes eking out an existence deep underground. More mundane explanations included chemical reactions between water and Martian rocks.The new measurements do not settle the question, but the team led by Christopher Webster at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion lab in California reveals the first regular pattern in Mars’s fluctuating methane. Tests on the Martian air show that background levels of methane rise and fall with the changing seasons. As winter gives way to summer in the northern hemisphere, the methane triples from 0.24 to 0.65 parts per billion.Webster suspects that reservoirs of methane lie deep under the surface of Mars, perhaps in water crystals called clathrates, and leak the gas continuously. When the methane reaches the surface, it sticks to Martian dust but is released in ever-increasing quantities when the ground warms up in the summer.“These subsurface reservoirs could be from ancient methane that was trapped underground, or from methane that is forming today. Either way it could be produced by chemistry or by microbial activity. We certainly cannot rule out a biological source at this stage,” said Webster.Taking the measurements was no easy task. A year on Mars lasts two Earth years, so to spot a seasonal pattern in the methane levels, the scientists had to take readings for four Earth years. “That’s why it has taken us so long,” said Webster. “Talk about having patience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da2c359956f50125815a6b21db1a23ef2a43ceb2/0_42_2760_1656/master/2760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=351ae426f46b9951ae89c944f5e317e3","title":"simona halep sweeps aside garbine muguruza reach french open tennis final","story":"It is testimony to the depth of their friendship that Sloane Stephens’s perfectly shaped backhand down the line to put Madison Keys out of her misery and out of their French Open semi-final on Thursday was struck almost apologetically.When it landed like a merciful knife into the deuce corner to end their one‑sided match in just an hour and 17 minutes, the winner raised her arms in celebration, smiled broadly then looked immediately up the court on a packed Philippe-Chatrier to commiserate with her fellow American.Stephens played an almost perfect defensive game, soaking up seven aces and keeping her mistakes to a minimum, to win 6-4, 6-4 and book a place in the final on Saturday against the world No\u0026nbsp1, Simona Halep, who earlier took an hour and a half to break down the resistance of Garbiñe Muguruza, 6-1, 6-4.In the second semi-final a plainly nervous Keys hit 41 unforced errors, 22 of them on her forehand, as she strove to get into the contest. They have been here before. In the US\u0026nbspOpen final last year – a first for both of them – Stephens won in 61 minutes, forcing 30 unforced errors from Keys, keeping her own down to six.“It’s always hard playing someone from your country and such a good friend,” Stephens said. “I was just pleased to get through that today and play some good tennis.”Key to her improvement after a long stretch out injured before her comeback last year has been Stephens’s noticeably calmer demeanour. She looks content, on and off the court, and her game has benefited from it.Halep will be an altogether different proposition. She is 5-2 up in their careers and Stephens has not beaten her since winning on the hard courts of the Australian Open in 2012. In Paris, however, the Romanian’s clay smarts make a considerable difference she beat Stephens 6-4, 6-3 in the quarter-finals four years ago.While Stephens, the No\u0026nbsp10 seed, has had an easier tournament, Halep will probably start favourite. Her record on clay this season is 15-3 and, although her serve faltered a little on Thursday, she had plenty left against Muguruza.It is a compliment to the Russian as any win against Sharapova, even at this stage of her career, takes the sort of perseverance that can lead on to more success in that tournament.Halep’s one problem here had been starting strongly. She dropped her first set of the tournament to Alison Riske, struggled at the beginning of her third-round match against Andrea Petkovic before bagelling her in the second set, and went down in a first‑set tie-break in the quarters against Angelique Kerber. Not this time.“Sometimes it’s working well, sometimes not,” she said. “But, if you finish the match in a good way, doesn’t matter that much. Today I just felt good on court. I felt positive and I started to play very well from the\u0026nbspbeginning.”This is her fourth final in a grand slam tournament – although she is yet to break through – and Stephens’s second. But Halep says she will do nothing different.“I don’t know what I would change – probably nothing,” she said. “I will keep my routine.“I have more experience now. I feel calm. And I have two more days until we play. I will stay chilled, I will relax. And then we will see what is going to happen on Saturday. But, for sure, I will fight for every ball.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4589948bf8ad3d372b3969e5506a58d901bdf739/0_32_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62f579b185e5579de0b1ebd976b2cf97","title":"wakefield wigan super league match report","story":"Shaun Wane insisted on Thursday night that “there is no panic at all” at Wigan, after yet another defeat for the Warriors amid off-field turmoil at one of Super League’s most famous clubs.This was Wigan’s third successive defeat since the sudden decision from Wane to announce he would be ending his 30-year association with the club at the end of this season.The Warriors have scored just four tries in those three games.The headlines which accompanied the ill-fated behaviour of the Tomkins brothers last weekend have stolen much of the spotlight in the past seven days, but it is impossible to avoid the fact that on the field Wigan’s form has collapsed since news of Wane’s impending departure broke.“There’s absolutely no panic at all,” Wane said. “We have to improve and we need to be better, work harder, and I need to be smarter. But they’re a strong bunch, and I know people will enjoy the position we’re in.”Home games against Wigan usually bring out the best in Chris Chester’s Wakefield side, and by the end it was hard to argue with the final scoreline being so comprehensively in Trinity’s favour. Like Wigan they, too, have only league matters to focus on after exiting the Challenge Cup but it is not unreasonable that, with more performances such as this, a top-four push could be realistic. They have now beaten the league’s top two at home this season.With one of their greatest sons, Neil Fox, in attendance, this was a performance of which he would have approved. “We want to be in that top six every year, and it’s really important for us now to invest a bit more money in the team – but we’re looking up, not down,” Chester said post-match.Wakefield took an early lead when some wonderful lead-up play allowed the wing Ben Jones-Bishop to cross. Ryan Hampshire improved that try with a penalty before Bill Tupou finished well shortly after.Trinity’s dominance emanated from the strength of their pack, and after the outstanding David Fifita won them another penalty Hampshire improved again to make it 14-0. By the time Wigan scored via Gabe Hamlin, it ended a barren run of 184 minutes without a point.Trailing 14-6 at the break, it was clear the first score after half-time was vital. It went to Wakefield as Jones-Bishop superbly picked a Sean O’Loughlin pass with the visitors pressing to race the length and, realistically, consign Wigan to yet another defeat.Tom Johnstone then produced a magnificent finish after another Wigan error, and while the visitors did briefly threaten a thrilling finish when Tom Davies and Morgan Escare scored it always felt a stretch too far for a side so dramatically out of sorts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69881e930a58569e24bfb43b5bb0ba054993b259/0_176_5292_3175/master/5292.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24fa1bccb404d423bd3f74263f7535d7","title":"my name is lucy barton review laura linney triumphs as a writer confronting her past","story":"Bridge theatre, LondonElizabeth Strout’s novel works outstandingly on stage, thanks to sole performer Linney’s nuanced command of the narrativeNovels, depending on the stream of time, rarely make good plays. Elizabeth Strout’s first-person narrative, longlisted for the Man Booker prize in 2016, however, breaks the rules and fits perfectly on the stage. That’s partly because of the quality of the writing and partly because of a beautifully nuanced solo performance by Laura Linney: a space that recently looked underpopulated with a four-character play, suddenly feels colonised by Linney’s commanding presence. Fans of the book will know that it is the reminiscence of a writer hospitalised for nine weeks in New York by a mysterious illness. But the focus is on five days when the eponymous heroine renews acquaintance with her mother, who has come to visit her from rural Illinois and from whom she has been long estranged. The two women talk, gossip about people from Lucy’s past, warily seek each other’s love. In the end, the mother departs as abruptly as she came and you feel the two women have briefly bonded without ever addressing their shared guilt: in the mother’s case, over Lucy’s impoverished childhood and, in Lucy’s, over her own necessary desertion.It sounds slight: in fact, it’s a story full of mysterious resonances. What comes out in performance, even more than in reading the book, is the idea that, even if you totally reinvent yourself, your past remains inescapable. Lucy has sought to overcome a childhood in which she and her siblings were beaten and deprived of the consolations of TV, films and magazines. Her father, who fought in the second world war, suffered from what we would now call post-traumatic stress disorder. Fleeing Illinois, Lucy has settled in New York, married, had children and acquired the ruthlessness that is part of a successful writer’s equipment. Yet, as Lucy admits, the Barton family provided a structure she was unaware of, until it was ended by death. Although I was sorry not to hear more of Lucy’s literary mentor, Sarah Payne, Rona Munro’s adaptation is sensitive to Strout’s structure. Richard Eyre’s production also has a distilled clarity: Bob Crowley’s set consists of a hospital bed and chair, while Luke Halls’s video design modulates between vistas of the gleamingly geometric Chrysler building and Illinois acres of soybeans and corn, which seem to stretch to infinity. But it is Linney who triumphantly carries the evening. I’d seen her once before on stage, in Eyre’s Broadway production of The Crucible, where she caught perfectly Elizabeth Proctor’s puritan severity. Here she switches easily between different modes. She talks to us, the audience, with warmth and ease. When she characterises Lucy’s mother, prattling on about the marital misfortunes of sundry relations, her voice acquires a rasping, midwestern edge. As Lucy relives her hospital memories, Linney is even more extraordinary: she shifts between exasperated fury at her mother’s wilful incuriosity and loving astonishment at this unworldly old woman’s ability to negotiate labyrinthine hospital corridors and the New York jungle. You can see the story in several ways but it is partly about the enforced loneliness of the writer who, at the same time, reinforces our common humanity. Linney, as a performer, has mastered the art of public solitude and gives you the uncanny feeling that you are listening not to an invented story but a slice of lived experience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82c90726839a6e90168dfe6ecba072f16e38618d/0_0_3675_2205/master/3675.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=199b98df08344ecccb5431473cee3e25","title":"marshall major iii bluetooth review wireless headphones","story":"The much-loved British brand has improved its wireless on-ear range, perfect for metal and hip-hop heads alikeThe Marshall Major III Bluetooth headphones are the latest in the much-loved British audio brand’s wireless headphone range, and while the changes are minor over the last pair they are still a winning combination of look, sound and battery life.You’d be hard pressed to notice the difference at first glance between 2016’s Major II Bluetooth and the new Major III Bluetooth. But compare them side by side and you realise they are slimmer and better looking, maintaining the classic Marshall styling in black vinyl.In fact, the new headphones are 24g lighter, which combined with softer ear pads make them a touch more comfortable to wear. They still squeeze my head pretty hard, but the top band does give a bit so they will eventually wear in.They are on-ear headphones, meaning they sit directly on your ear, not around it. The arms are slimmer and simplified, but maintain their height, twisting and tilting degrees of freedom so that they sit flat against your ear. The controls have been simplified for the Major III, with the brilliant gold-coloured metal joystick at the bottom of the left phone taking over all functionality. Hold it in for a few seconds to turn them on or off, press it once to pause or play the music, twice to trigger Google Assistant or Siri, tilt it left or right to skip the track and up or down to adjust volume. It all works very well, making you wonder why so many other manufacturers don’t have a similar control scheme.The Bluetooth connection is strong in all scenarios and supports aptX for higher fidelity and lower latency streaming with modern Android smartphones. Pairing is easy – just hold down the joystick for a few more seconds when powering the headphones on and find them on your phone.A standard 3.5mm analogue headphone socket is in the right ear cup for listening wired or when the battery runs out.The Major headphones have always sounded good with rock and similar genres, but the Major III Bluetooth suit a wider range of music types. They still sound great with driving rock music, but feed them something slightly more subtle such as the live version of Hotel California by the Eagles from Hell Freezes Over and you can hear good separation, punchy bass drums and clear vocals. The sound is very direct and those looking for thundering bass will have to look elsewhere. But the Marshalls make anything sound good, from Librarian by My Morning Jacket and Do I Wanna Know? by the Arctic Monkeys at the indie-rock end of things, to hip-hop tracks such as Dr Dre’s Forgot About Dre or Can’t Take It With Me by Blue Sky Black Death.The new Marshalls lasted well over 30 hours in my testing, making them some of the longest-lasting Bluetooth headphones around. You’ll probably be able to go weeks of commuting between charges, even at relatively high volumes.They charge in half the time that the older model did, going from dead to fully charged in around three hours via the microUSB socket in the right earcup.The Marshall Major III Bluetooth only come in black and cost £129, which puts them in the mid-range of Bluetooth headphones. Competitors range from around £50 and up. The previous generation Major II Bluetooth are still on sale for £69, while a wired-only version of the Major III cost £69 and the Marshall Mid Bluetooth cost £169.The Marshall Major III Bluetooth are another brilliant pair of wireless on-ear headphones from the British audio brand that bring great sound, very long battery life and classic styling.They aren’t perfect, squeezing my head a little too hard, lacking NFC for instant pairing and with the cost of Bluetooth headphones coming down over the last couple of years they’re not quite as good value as they were in 2016.But the Major III Bluetooth are packed with small improvements over almost every aspect of the design, fit and sound compared to the previous generation, and worth considering, particularly if you’re into driving rock music.Pros: great sound, long battery life, great controls, fold up for travel, sturdy, great look, good connectivityCons: on-ear design may not be comfortable for everyone, no NFC for one-touch pairing"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/498611917de1548ede4eb387dbed12db2b516f62/0_0_5222_3134/master/5222.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43372f40d3029c6d99e6682a39cfd36c","title":"hong kong city walking guide wan chai district","story":"Traditional buildings and bold skyscrapers, open-air markets and hip design stores all sit shoulder to shoulder in one of Hong Kong’s oldest districtsWan Chai is one of Hong Kong’s oldest areas and it’s always been far less influenced by the city’s one-time colonial overlords than its neighbouring districts to the west. To this day, Wan Chai is a dense assemblage of residential flats, small stores, hole-in-the-wall restaurants and the occasional bar, crammed into just a few streets. We start at Wan Chai’s far western end, by Star Street – an area that’s home to some of the city’s hippest boutiques and eateries. Grab an energising coffee at Elephant Grounds at the entrance to the area, before heading up the hill to explore. Make sure to pop by design store Kapok, which stocks work from some of Hong Kong’s best designers, before swinging by combination art gallery and print shop Odd One Out. Also seek out Lala Curio, hidden away down an alleyway off the main streets. It’s crammed full of whimsical, Chinoiserie-inspired decor, furniture and accessories.We’re heading down the hill and into Wan Chai proper now, turning on to Queen’s Road East: the city’s first ever road, which still snakes along a good portion of the island. The Happy Cake Shop (106 Queen’s Road East) has been baking Hong Kong’s unique buns and cakes since 1979 and there’s always a reassuring queue out the door. Trays of baked goods are regularly brought out from the back, and you’ll want to grab whatever’s piping hot: go for a coconut-filled cocktail bun or a sugar-crusted pineapple bun, which actually contains no pineapple at all. And of course, you can never go wrong with a classic egg custard tart.Further down Queen’s Road, we get to the Hopewell Centre – one of the city’s very first skyscrapers. This cylindrical building contains Hong Kong’s only revolving restaurant, The Grand Buffet but you’re not here for the food: you’re here for the glass observation lift that propels visitors up to the 56th floor. As you ascend, the dense city falls away from you and the harbour pops into view beyond. We follow Queen’s Road again until we arrive at Stone Nullah Lane. A “nullah” is an open storm drain, an Indian word borrowed during colonial times. Thankfully, the nullah has since been covered over, although the name remains. Sitting on the lane is one of the city’s best-preserved pre-war buildings: the Blue House (72 Stone Nullah Lane), so-named for its vibrant hue. This balconied tenement appears just as it would have done when it was built in the 1920s, thanks to restoration efforts that have won it Unesco plaudits. The building was once home to a respected kung fu studio, and the ground floor was occupied by a bone-setting clinic – the traditional Chinese practice that’s a combination of chiropractic and martial arts. Now, the Hong Kong House of Stories on the ground floor hosts small-scale exhibitions. At the top of Stone Nullah Lane, the beautiful Pak Tai Temple sits ensconced in the shade of two enormous banyan trees. It’s the largest temple complex on Hong Kong Island, hidden away among auto repair shops and residential units. Pak Tai is a martial god, responsible for the triumph of good over evil. The temple was built in 1863 but is actually home to a copper statue of the deity that’s more than 250 years older. Make sure to check out the buildings to the side, where some of the temple’s original tiling is preserved.By now you’ll be in need of a restoring drink, and Tai Lung Fung (5-9 Hing Wan Street) has just the thing. This unpretentious bar is steeped in Hong Kong culture, from the distinctly Hong Kong tiling to the old-school memorabilia on the walls – all just the right side of kitsch. Suitably refreshed, we’re heading into the open-air market on Wan Chai Road. The “wet market” – so named for the water spritzed on the vegetables, and the stalls that are hosed down every day – offers a true snapshot of Hong Kong life. Market-goers haggle over the price of bok choy, butchers carve off chunks of pork belly, and chickens are killed and plucked for the freshest possible meal. In among it all are dotted dried seafood stores, eateries and bric-a-brac boutiques.Time for a classic bite in a cha chaan teng. These no-frills eateries – literally “tea restaurants”– grew up around Hong Kong’s industrial boom in the 50s and 60s, serving uniquely Hong Kong cuisine. The 61-year-old Ho Wah Cafe still serves up all the old favourites. Order the house speciality: a toasted corned beef and egg sandwich, washed down with strong, sweet milk tea. Next door to Ho Wah sits the Green House, named for its one-time paint job. This group of 10 prewar tenement buildings has been refurbished (and painted white), reconfigured around a small open square into Comix Home Base, an arts centre for Hong Kong’s comics industry. The space holds regular exhibitions, so there’s always something new to see.Reward your wanderings with a superbly crafted cocktail at The Optimist (239 Hennessy Road), one of the city’s best restaurants. Or if you’re in need of a view, then head across the road to Wooloomooloo Steakhouse, whose rooftop bar offers gob-smacking views of the city from right in the middle of it all. Look over the edge and the roads seem to stretch away far beyond you, orange-lit arteries glowing and blinking as dusk falls on Hong Kong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cf10efd7aa20b15b8d99e75f1b54cbe6198341d/0_0_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=124cde3a65d79ef4fee65f25ac7c86cd","title":"leros greek island dodecanese greece beach mussolini","story":"This Dodecanese gem has 20th-century Italian influences as well as the classic repertoire of secret beaches and laid-back tavernas‘It is an unusual island,” said my friend Yannis, slightly self-consciously. “We are a bit different from our neighbours.”Yannis, a cafe owner, is right: Leros is unusual, but in a good way. It is just a few miles from Turkey, but a million tourist miles from Kos and Rhodes, its Dodecanese siblings. It has mostly slipped under the holiday radar, which is a shame because it has everything we all want from a Greek island – beaches, fishing villages, tavernas, ruins – plus an extraordinary modern history. And for that we can thank Mussolini.The Italians grabbed the Dodecanese in 1912 and Mussolini later poured money, and cement, into Leros to make it the base for his imperial ambitions. A huge naval complex was built and a new capital, Portolago, emerged from a mosquito-ridden swamp.This model town is one of the finest examples outside Italy of rationalist architecture (think art deco but without the lightness of touch) and it’s largely intact nearly 100 years later. The broad boulevards, grand villas for the officers, apartment blocks for the lower ranks and market hall are still here. It’s not hard to imagine Italian soldiers and sailors parading along the seafrontThe town, renamed Lakki after the war, was left to rot for decades but the islanders have learned to love it and it is now coming back to life. The cinema (cineleros), for example, now beautifully restored, is very Cinema Paradiso.The second world war left its mark all over the island: in derelict military buildings with amazing murals painted by bored squaddies and in tunnels in the cliffs (a history told underground at the War Tunnels Museum near Lakki, €3). Off the coast lie the wrecks of many ships and warplanes from the Battle of Leros, which inspired Alistair MacLean’s The Guns of Navarone (book es at hydrovius.gr).It also explains why most of us don’t know Leros. Mussolini’s former military barracks held political prisoners during Greece’s military dictatorship and became notorious mental hospitals. (They’re now a refugee camp.) These establishments gave islanders jobs, so tourism wasn’t such a big deal. But times have changed: the prisons and hospitals (though sadly not the camp) are closed, so tourists now focus on the island’s more conventional attractions.The Knights of St John reached Leros 600 years before Il Duce, and the Byzantine castle they conquered and fortified still dominates the island. It glowers over Alinda bay and its beach, the longest on the island. It’s a beautiful spot and the closest little Leros (it’s only about eight miles long) gets to mass tourism. There are many good fish tavernas in the area but locals rate Mylos, which has an amazing setting on the waterfront by a windmill. Like in most places on Leros, a meal for two here shouldn’t cost more than €50, often less.I love the nearby port of Agia Marina, with its ferries bustling back and forth between islands. It’s perfect for a leisurely coffee and some people-watching. If you summon the energy, a short walk up the hill is Platanos, the old capital, with a jumble of narrow lanes and white-washed houses. Panteli beach, below Platanos, is actually prettier than Alinda and I prefer it, largely because of its excellent restaurants, such as El Greco.There are fantastic walks all over the island and on foot is often the only way to get to the many attractive little beaches. One of my favourites is the first cove on the south side of Gourna bay, where there will probably just be some goats to watch you swim in the clear water. And that brings us neatly back to Mussolini and Leros’s fascinating 20th-century story, because it passes a giant second world war acoustic mirror, a precursor of radar. The concrete structure has been recently restored. Mussolini may be long gone but he has not been forgotten on Leros.• Eight-room Archontiko Angelou (doubles from €75 room-only) is a charming 19th-century villa in Alinda behind the seafront. Bianco (doubles from €55 B\u0026ampB) is a boutique hotel in the town centre. Olympic Air has daily flights from Athens to Leros in summer for around €100 one-way. Frequent ferries run by Blue Star  and Dodekanisos Seaways connect Leros with Athens (from about €33), Kos, Rhodes and other Dodecanese islands.

The city tried to lure a large grocer with financial incentives but had no luck. “Access to fresh food options can have a profound effect on the health and wellbeing of iniduals, which can transform communities. I believe everyone should have equal access to healthy options as well as education to improve eating habits.”One recipient, Glenda Cunningham, of the Baylor Scott and White health and wellness centre, praised the project’s work. “The community looks forward to the Big Tex urban farm delivery each week. The food is fresh, free and beautiful,” she said.In Orange, Connecticut, the food production company Watson’s fellowship garden has been running for four years. The company grows produce for food banks and had extra space available, so it decided to expand and has opened its garden to a centre helping children with autism spectrum issues. Christina Cole, 47, a graphic designer at Watson, said: “The plot for Milestones Behavioural Services, which includes a pumpkin and melon patch, gives kids with autism and developmental disabilities the chance to not only have fun and be outside, but also learn life skills and take home what they grow and learn to cook with their families. With the garden season kicking in, we’re getting ready to put in a corn maze.”According to the Connecticut food bank, one in eight people in the state struggle with hunger. “We feel no one should have to think about where their next meal is coming from,” Cole said.The company provides 4,800 plants each year, and those not used are donated to the food bank for use in its gardens. Watson hopes the garden will not only help children but also address food insecurity facing older generations. “Those who are elderly and on a low income used to get vouchers from the state to access fresh fruit and vegetables, but the programme has been cut due to a lack of funding. With our garden we hope to work with the community and help with such issues. Everyone should have access to food, much less something fresh,” Cole said.She said shops were willing to donate food in West Haven but did not have the resources to do so. “I’m in the process of trying to organise the logistics of starting runners to help businesses get food to those who need it most. We’re hoping it will help reduce food waste in the area.” Rose Majestic, the executive director of Wheat, which provides food to people in crisis, said: “The people who comes to us can’t afford fresh produce so Watson’s weekly deliveries go a long way in helping them. We hope other businesses that have yards that can be dug up and used for feeding the hungry in our community start to do the same.”Watson is hosting an event in June to try to get local businesses to start their own community food-growing projects. “In light of the world nowadays, we should all get back to learning to grow our own food. It is the essential basis for survival. It can only further us all to know how to feed ourselves healthily and it’s a great help to have an alternative food source for our neighbours.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The senate, however, added nearly four dozen amendments, meaning the legislation will now return to the House of Commons for consideration. The federal Liberal government, led by Justin Trudeau, introduced the legislation last year in a bid to make Canada the second country in the world to legalise the cannabis, after Uruguay. Medical marijuana is already legal in Canada. The legislation ided the responsibilities between the federal and provincial governments, with Ottawa responsible for regulating production while leaving it to provinces and territories to decide how the drug will be distributed and sold. Once passed and implemented, those who want to grow their own marijuana will be limited to four plants per household. Canadians will be allowed to carry up to 30 grams of dried cannabis for personal use while those who sell or give marijuana to minors or who drive under its influence will face stiff penalties. Since becoming the Liberal leader in 2013, Trudeau has argued that the decriminalisation and regulation of marijuana would help keep the drug away from children and ensure profits don’t end up in the hands of what he described as “criminal elements.” While the sale of recreational marijuana is not expected to begin until August or September, the senate vote was one of the major obstacles standing in the way of legalisation as Conservatives senators sought to block the initiative. The many amendments added by the senate – and which will now be considered by MPs – reflect some of this opposition, such as tighter restrictions on advertising by cannabis companies and allowing provinces to prohibit home cultivation.

I’m Warren Murray with more jargon to add to the Brexit lexicon. Theresa May has bent to secretary David Davis’s demands over the “backstop” that would keep Britain in the EU customs union for the sake of an open Irish border. But isions persist in the cabinet over Brexit – as evidenced by a secret recording of Boris Johnson, where he warned of a “meltdown” on the road to exiting the European Union and dismissed the Irish border issue as “folly”. The foreign secretary criticised Philip Hammond’s Treasury as “the heart of remain”, saying it had focused on “mumbo jumbo” predictions about short-term disruption, instead of the potential gains from leaving the EU. “Imagine Trump doing Brexit,” Johnson told Tory dining partners at Chatham House. “He’d go in bloody hard … There’d be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he’d gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere. It’s a very, very good thought.”Life on Mars – Yes it’s another of those headlines but in this case the facts behind it are quite promising. The venerable Mars Curiosity rover has drilled into a piece of mudstone and found chemical traces of organic compounds. “It is not telling us that life was there,” says Jennifer Eigenbrode, a Nasa biogeochemist, “but it is saying that everything organisms really needed to live in that kind of environment, all of that was there.” It points to the Mars of long ago having had lakes that held the carbon-based compounds necessary for life similar to our own. Could life still be there? “These molecules could have been part of life, but they could also have been food for life,” said Kirsten Siebach, a planetary geologist. “This is very promising for the preservation of potential ancient life on the planet.”G7 begins – Donald Trump looks set to clash with everyone else as the G7 summit gets under way in Quebec today. France, Germany, the UK, Japan, Canada and Italy will be lobbying the US president to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. The UK, Germany and France will demand that European companies having dealings with Iran are spared from US sanctions. More pressing are steel and aluminium tariffs, with the EU poised to impose retaliatory measures on American goods ranging from jeans to motorbikes. Sharp words have circulated between several of the leaders: Emmanuel Macron of France has called for the G7-minus-one to resist Trump’s attempts to impose a “crude hegemony” while Canada’s Justin Trudeau called Trump’s tariffs “unilateral and illegal”. Trump hit back, claiming that Canadian trade policy was “killing our agriculture”.‘Left to die’ – A 38-year-old woman with advanced breast cancer was denied potentially life-saving chemotherapy for nearly six weeks in what refugee support groups say is another manifestation of the “hostile environment” policy. Kelemua Mulat, from Ethiopia, is now receiving the treatment after the Christie hospital in Manchester managed to override a Home Office decision that she was not eligible for NHS care. Mulat has been refused asylum but is appealing, saying she is part of a pro-democracy group whose members have been sentenced to death or long jail terms.‘New room in the Great Pyramid’ – An unheard album of John Coltrane’s music has been found and will be released at the end of this month. The session, recorded on 6 March 1963 in New Jersey, features the legendary jazz saxophonist in what is regarded as his “classic quartet”.The master tape was lost but it turned out Coltrane had given a copy to his soon-to-be ex-wife and it remained in her family. Both Directions at Once: the Lost Album comes out on 29 June. The British jazz and improv saxophonist Evan Parker told the : “This release is most welcome – the ‘classic quartet’ was where Coltrane did his best work.”“I can trace my Romany ancestry back at least six generations I was brought up to know the Romani language,” writes Damian Le Bas as he goes back on the road to reconnect with his Traveller roots. “I was raised, and still live, in a Romany psychological realm a mental Gypsyland.”Eight months into his journey to rediscover the stopping places of Traveller life, “I realised how sparsely furnished my van was … bed, stove, wash gear, clothes and so forth. But there were other trappings of Romany life, when it was lived most richly: beautiful furnishings, gilded surfaces, portable pictures, talismans and silks. I’ve been missing a trick.” With his Mum’s help the van was soon decked out: “An Islamic purple velvet hanging … matching Bedouin horse-cloths … brightly coloured Indian tapestry cloths. I slammed the doors and smiled as I thought of the road ahead.”Gareth Southgate has admitted he has “serious decisions” to make over his preferred lineup for England’s opening group game at the World Cup after a much changed team impressed in the 2-0 dismissal of Costa Rica, which served as a productive run-out for a starting team of Plan Bs and second-choicers. England football fans visiting Russia are at serious risk of homophobic, racist and anti-British attacks and have been offered only “vague reassurance” about their safety by the Foreign Office and police, MPs have warned.Red Bull’s Max Verstappen has rejected suggestions he should change his driving approach, saying he might “headbutt someone” if he is questioned any further on being involved in incidents at every race this season. Sloane Stephens brushed aside Madison Keys in an all-American semi-final at Roland Garros to set up a French Open final against Simona Halep, after the Romanian top seed defeated Garbiñe Muguruza. The mouthwatering prospect of Anthony Joshua finally facing the American Deontay Wilder in a huge heavyweight title reunification fight has moved several steps closer.

It was the proverbial tough day at the office for executives at some top companies yesterday.

Three other people were injured. The same month, a woman in her 70s drove her car into a hospital waiting area in south-western Japan, injuring 13 people.And in November last year, two people were killed when a car driven by an 83-year-old woman rammed into them at a hospital near Tokyo.As a super-ageing society, Japan is at the forefront of a dementia crisis that experts warn will affect other countries with growing older populations in the decades to come.According to the health ministry, 4.6 million people are living with some form of dementia, with the total expected to soar to about 7.3 million people – or one in five Japanese aged 65 or over – by 2025."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5eb297390d913aca6c3416aedaa26f65d1bb899/0_219_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b11fcb6d0f3484fb58e46503950f7a9","title":"ontario election results populist doug ford to become premier","story":"The brother of troubled late former Toronto mayor Rob Ford to become leader of Canada’s most populous provinceDoug Ford – the brother of controversial former Toronto mayor Rob Ford – is the new leader of Canada’s most populous province, winning a majority government in a local show of strength for the isive wedge politics that have rattled much of the world.“This victory belongs to the people,” Ford told supporters on Thursday. “Together we made history. We have taken back Ontario, we have delivered a government that is for the people.” Ford – a businessman who rails against the elite and regularly peppers his speeches and interviews with boasts and falsehoods – is the brother of Rob Ford, the former Toronto mayor who made headlines around the world after he admitted to smoking crack cocaine while in office.In his victory speech, Ford thanked his brother. “I know my brother Rob is looking down from heaven. I’m just getting chills talking about him right now,” he said. “I know Rob is celebrating with us tonight. We owe so much to Rob’s legacy.” Throughout the campaign Ford’s brand of populism prompted a slew of comparisons to Donald Trump, as the Canadian leader took aim at safe injection sites and opposed legislation to create protest-free zones outside abortion clinics. But in contrast to Trump, he campaigned hard among Canada’s immigrant communities who hold considerable sway in several ridings in the province.He has long been a controversial figure in Canada during his one term as a Toronto city councillor he refused to attend the city’s Pride parade – describing it as “middle-aged men, with pot bellies, running down the street buck naked” – and lashed out at a home for developmentally disabled youth, labelling it a “nightmare” that had “ruined the community”.Ford also gained a reputation as his brother’s most aggressive defender, lashing out at Toronto police and journalists as Rob Ford fended off claims he smoked crack.Doug Ford himself was plagued by drug-related allegations in 2013, the Globe and Mail reported he had sold hashish for several years in the 1980s. Ford has denied the claims.Ford will now lead Ontario, a province that is home to nearly a third of Canada’s 36 million residents as well as much of the country’s financial and manufacturing sectors. In some ways, Ford’s win echoes the rise of populism in countries such as Poland, Hungary and Italy, said Ian Lee, a professor at Carleton University. “He’s very much a populist,” he said. But he pointed to different underlying reasons. “I don’t believe that this is part of the bandwagon or the trend that we’re seeing in the US, in Poland, in Hungary, in other countries in Europe.” Instead he saw Ford’s victory as a rejection of the governing Liberals, who had steered the province to the left. The Liberals, led by premier Kathleen Wynne, were reduced to seven seats – one seat shy of the eight needed for official party status. Pollsters had long predicted that voter frustration about growing inequality, the rising cost of living and economic uncertainty would take a toll on her party. As the results came in, Wynne, Ontario’s first female premier as well as its first openly gay premier, announced she would step down as leader. “There is another generation, and I am passing the torch to that generation,” she said. Some of the deep clamour for change emerged simply from the fact that the Liberals had governed for 15 years – a lengthy stretch for any political party, said Cristine de Clercy, a political science professor at Western University in southern Ontario. But the dizzying pace of initiatives rolled out by Wynne’s government might have also played a role, said de Clercy, citing a rise in the minimum wage and reforms in workplace legislation and education. “She asked Ontarians to embrace many initiatives very quickly and I think certainly in some sectors people pushed back.” What few predicted, however, was that the race would become a battle between the Conservatives and the left-leaning New Democratic party (NDP) pitting rightwing populist politics against promises to increase government spending and raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy.The Conservatives’ commanding lead eroded during campaigning as Ford refused to detail how his promises would be funded – simply saying he would find “efficiencies” across the government – and amid calculations that suggested his tax cuts would disproportionately benefit the province’s wealthiest.Just days before the vote, Ford family drama roared into the headlines, as the widow and children of Rob Ford filed a C$16.5m ($12.3m) lawsuit in a Toronto court. Rob Ford, who served as Toronto’s mayor from 2010 to 2014, died in March 2016 after a battle with cancer. The lawsuit accused Doug Ford of being a “negligent” business manager whose decisions had steadily chipped away at the value of Deco Labels, the company the Ford brothers had inherited from their father.“It’s going to be a very different legislature that convenes,” said de Clercy. “It’s worth remembering Mr Ford is a total rookie. He has not participated in Ontario politics, he doesn’t know the ways and means of the legislature. There is a pretty steep learning curve for him, as there would be for any politician in his shoes.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed0942c4c43f3005d93e324d52db75994cb8e2c8/179_0_5210_3128/master/5210.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=922f66d49a15a9b3ada058dc4f88b6c6","title":"would you give a job to this gangster","story":"In one of the world’s deadliest countries, a growing movement sees jobs for ex-gang members as the only way to end the violenceIt was a scorching hot day when Carlos Fernando Argueta was interviewed for a job at a clothing factory in western El Salvador, but he still wore a long-sleeved shirt. The tattoos on his arms had cost him jobs before, tell-tale signs of his past life in the notoriously brutal Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) street gang.“Believe me, I’m very ashamed,” says Argueta, 39, who joined the gang when he was 12. “I know that we corrupted many hearts and minds. But if God has his arms open for people like us, then why can’t society give us a job opportunity?”Between 30,000 and 60,000 active gang members in El Salvador, in a population of 6.3 million. It was one of the most dangerous countries in the world last year in 2015 it recorded one murder every hour, after a truce between the MS-13 and Barrio 18 gangs fell apart and a bloody turf war resumed.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThe interviewer spotted that Argueta was attempting to hide his past. He gave him the job anyway.Argueta has worked for nine years at League Central America, a clothing factory that produces apparel for US universities including Harvard and Princeton. It’s one of a growing number of firms, at least 10 so far, in El Salvador hiring reformed gang members. Those include energy firm AES Corporation and a tuna packing company, according to the Trabajemos por la Paz (Working for Peace) group, which has found jobs for more than 700 reformed gang members since 2008.Unsurprisingly, research suggests that those who can find regular employment are more likely to escape the cycle of gang violence that has tormented the country.League Central America has employed at least 100 former gangsters since 2009. The company pairs with local churches and community groups to provide job training and facilitate the delicate process of cutting ties, which involves careful negotiation with leaders who view defectors with suspicion. In fact, members are never considered to have truly left, only to have become calmado, or inactive.According to the head of League Central America, Rodrígo Bolaños, none of those who joined his firm have returned to active status.This process of rehabilitation stands in stark contrast to the politically popular mano dura, or iron fist, approach to dealing with the country’s gang violence, which has seen lethal extrajudicial violence meted out by security forces. “We have stopped a tremendous problem by embracing the community, giving them a true opportunity in life. We’re resolving the problem instead of killing them,” says Bolaños.“It sends the message that we have to embrace the community if we want to have a healthy country.”Manuel Oswaldo Henríquez, a 31-year-old employee at League Central America, joined the Barrio 18 gang at 14. “After ninth grade, I didn’t want to study anymore,” Henríquez says. “There was no future for me in this country because I had already tattooed my body.” His teachers were afraid of him, awarding passing grades out of fear. His life consisted of shootouts in rival neighbourhoods, followed by the inevitable retaliation on his own turf.“It’s hard being in the gang. It’s not like your mom telling you to do something. If you don’t follow the orders, there are punishments, beatings. That’s life in the gang.”Now, Henríquez has a respectable job that allows him to provide for his wife and six-year-old son.Not everyone is convinced of the merits of offering jobs to people such as Argueta and Henríquez who have perpetrated terrible crimes. Many Salvadorans bear the scars of years of gang violence. Some firms still refuse to partner with Trabajemos por la Paz, while others are only comfortable offering food for programmes and events. Those that do open their doors also face the task of winning over the existing employees.For Morales there’s a simple logic to the approach. “Any social reintegration programme is incomplete if it can’t provide people with a way of making a living that is respectable and socially accepted,” he says.Henríquez has faced resistance in his new life. “There are many people who don’t believe that gang members can change,” he says. “But they can, I’ve seen it in myself and I’ve seen it in other people as well. If there are opportunities, I know that a gang member can change and be different.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The survey, which was conducted for the BBC by polling firm Lucid Talk, found 59 per cent of people in Northern Ireland identify themselves strongly as Irish, 58 per cent as Northern Irish and 56 per cent as European. Of those surveyed, 29 per cent with a Protestant background defined themselves as Irish while only four per cent of those with a Catholic background identified as British. More than a quarter (28 per cent) said the UK’s decision to leave the European Union has made them more likely to vote for a united Ireland.

More than half of those surveyed still prefer a power sharing executive at Stormont. Over a quarter favour some form of joint authority between London and Dublin while 15 per cent would prefer direct rule from Westminster.

Photograph: Adrian DennisAFPGetty ImagesBritain will insist a permanent solution to keep the Border open is agreed by October and included in its withdrawal agreement to ensure that a backstop arrangement does not last beyond the end of 2021. Government sources in London said that British negotiators will not agree to a final deal that does not include a permanent, agreed solution for the Border as part of a framework on the future partnership between Britain and the EU that will accompany the withdrawal agreement.Britain’s proposal for the backstop was published on Thursday after prime minister Theresa May defused a cabinet revolt led by Brexit secretary David Davis by including in the document an end date for the backstop of December 2021, one year after the end of the post-Brexit transition period. Under the British proposal, the backstop would see the entire UK remaining part of the EU customs territory.“The UK is clear that the temporary customs arrangement, should it be needed, should be time limited, and that it will be only in place until the future customs arrangement can be introduced. The UK is clear that the future customs arrangement needs to deliver on the commitments made in relation to Northern Ireland. The UK expects the future arrangement to be in place by the end of December 2021 at the latest. There are a range of options for how a time limit could be delivered, which the UK will propose and discuss with the EU,” it says.Brexiteers fear that the arrangement could mean Britain would remain in the customs union indefinitely, with the EU wielding a veto over when it could leave, but the prime minister’s official spokesperson said the UK would not agree to such an arrangement.“We’re not going to sign up to anything which means that the EU can hold us in a temporary backstop when our customs arrangements are ready. At the point when new customs arrangements that meet our commitments on Northern Ireland are ready, the backstop must end. But we will talk to the EU about that as part of the wider negotiation on this proposal,” the spokesperson said.Downing Street insisted that the new proposal was consistent with the commitment Britain made last March that the backstop would remain in place “unless and until” another solution was found for the Border.“The point of the counterproposal is to make sure that if a customs arrangement with the EU is not in place by the end of the implementation period there won’t be a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and that is fully in tune with what we agreed in March,” the spokesperson said.“We are not looking to implement the backstop. We are confident that our system will be agreed and in place.”The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney, who is on a visit to the Middle East, said he would discuss the proposals with the commission negotiating team in the coming days.He stressed that “substantial progress on the backstop” was needed before the EU summit at the end of this month. “Clearly, a great deal of work remains to be done and this needs to be the highest priority for all sides in the weeks ahead,” he said.In Dublin, official sources said that while the British proposals published on Thursday did not constitute sufficient progress in themselves, they provided a basis to engage with the British, which may lead to achieving progress before the summit.Sources conceded, however, that with only two weeks’ negotiating space left before arrangements to finalise the summit are required, the timetable before the summit is extremely tight. The Irish Government has drawn some encouragement from the fact that the British government was now “engaging” with the issues but believes a fundamental breakthrough is still required in June.One senior Irish Government source said while it was obvious that greater detail was needed from the British before the end of June, it was important to “keep the show on the road”.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3523255.1528406081!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"foster criticises taoiseach for launching west belfast festival","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP leader Arlene Foster has criticisedTaoiseach Leo Varadkar’s decision to open the Féile an Phobail festival in Belfast. Photograph: Eric Luke DUP leader Arlene Foster added her voice to criticism of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s decision to open a festival in Belfast because of the links between certain events to the Republican movement.Critics rounded on Mr Varadkar over his decision to launch Féile an Phobail in west Belfast because it includes a talk by the leaders of the 1983 Maze Prison escape in which a prison officer was killed.Ms Foster said in a message posted on social media website Twitter that she was “very concerned at the message Leo Varadkar is sending with his apparent endorsement of all events at the west Belfast festival.”Unionist politicians along with Austin Stack, the son of murdered prison officer Brian Stack, and Maria Cahill who has accused members of the republican movement of abusing her objected to the Taoiseach’s decision to launch the festival.She tweeted that her thoughts were with the family of Brian Stack, David Black and Adrian Ismay - two other prisoner officers killed by republican paramilitaries - and “the families of prison officers who face daily threats.” She added the subject line: “#standwithwhatsright”The DUP leader made her remarks while retweeting a message posted by Austin Stack criticising Mr Varadkar for opening the festival.“The romance continues between Fine Gael and Sinn Féin,” he wrote, referring to the murder of the prison officer during the Maze escape. He pointed out that eight weeks after the prison break, some of the escapees murdered Irish army private Paddy Kelly in Ballinamore, Co Leitrim. Defending his decision to launch the festival, Mr Varadkar said that he was not considering cancelling his appearance and that it was a community festival which Ms Foster had spoken at in the past. He even pointed out that English singer-songwriter Olly Murs who appeared on the X Factor TV talent show in 2009 was appearing at the festival.“I believe the headline act this year is Olly Murs. I don’t think anyone could accuse him of being a die-hard republican,” said Mr Varadkar.This is his sixth visit to Northern Ireland since becoming Taoiseach last year. He travelled north on Thursday night ahead of a historic visit to the headquarters of the Orange Orange and the Museum of Orange Heritage in Belfast, the first such visit by a Taoiseach, on Friday morning.Mr Varadkar visited the oldest GAA club in Co Down at Mayobridge on Thursday evening before meeting the chief executives of the north-south implementation bodies in Newry. -the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

Photograph: Will OliverEPASo what this latest thing to have happened in all this Brexit business?After months of awaiting a British response to the EU’s draft proposal around the “backstop” solution – a default plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland post-Brexit – London has suggested its own version of the plan.Wait, what’s the backstop again?To maintain an invisible border, the EU and UK agreed in a political deal last December that if they had not agreed a trade deal post-Brexit or other specific solution for the Border, then there should be a backstop maintaining regulatory alignment North and South to avoid customs checks.Where does the Government stand on this?Dublin is pushing hard for the backstop because, in the absence of a long-term trade deal (which will take years to negotiate) and an alternative solution (several of which have been suggested by the UK and rejected by the EU), this fall-back solution effectively maintains the status quo on the island of Ireland post-Brexit.Did the UK approve of the EU’s suggested backstop?Even though it agreed in principle to a backstop, London said that it could not agree to the EU’s proposed backstop because alignment would only apply to Northern Ireland and in effect establish a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. This caused alarm among the Democratic Unionist Party whose support is keeping Theresa May and her Conservative Party in power in the House of Commons.The UK government has formally proposed the idea a “temporary customs arrangement” in a government paper that would apply to the UK as a whole, keeping the entire country in the EU customs union in the event of a failure to reach a deal on customs arrangements with the EU.This backstop would, crucially for ardent Brexit supporters in May’s government and party, be limited in time. It would continue beyond the proposed Brexit transition period, when EU and UK will remain aligned, from the UK’s formal departure in March 2019 until December 2020. This would maintain frictionless trade between the EU and the UK and eliminate tariffs, quotas and customs processes on all EU-UK trade.So how long would this time-limited backstop last?May’s government has said the time-limited backstop will only apply, should it be needed, until a permanent customs arrangement is introduced and that it “expects” this to be in place by the end of 2021.“Expects”? But what if the permanent plan is not in place by then?That is where things get complicated, not just for the upcoming negotiations around whether the two sides can meet somewhere in the middle in time for a summit of EU leaders at the end of this month.This is not a guaranteed cut-off date and the EU would likely reject that because it is temporary in nature, does not protect the EU single market and customs union, and because Brussels had rejected the idea of allowing the backstop to apply to the UK as a whole. But the fudged position keeps the Brexiteers happy because it ensures that the UK will not have indefinite membership of the EU customs union.Why this time-limited backstop?The temporary measure was agreed as a concession by May to quell a cabinet revolt by UK Brexit secretary David Davis, a hard Brexiteer who threatened resignation if it was not time-limited.What does the Irish Government think of the UK proposal?It welcomed the fact the UK has proposed something but it is still assessing it. Prior to the proposal, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar rejected the idea of a time-limited version of the post-Brexit backstop arrangement because, he said, the whole idea of a backstop was that it should apply until there is an alternative in place that maintains a frictionless, invisible border on the island. It should be an “all-weather” backstop, he said.So what next?The formal response of the EU’s Brexit “task force” team of negotiators is awaited.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"the lemass","story":"Stonewalling ended when Harold Wilson took power in 1964 and revealed location of bodyRoyal was eager to attend but prospect of official visits exercised former taoiseach"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3523719.1528438932!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar to visit orange order headquarters in northern ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar defended his decision to launch the west Belfast Féile an Phobail community event.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe Tánaiste Simon Coveney held what were termed “frank and forthright” discussions with Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu on Thursday night at the prime minister’s residence in Jerusalem. According to Irish diplomatic sources, the one-hour discussions focused on Middle East peace efforts, the situation in Gaza and bilateral relations and follows criticism by Dublin of Israeli actions on the Gaza border where 130 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire over the last few months. Mr Netanyahu, who also serves as Israel’s acting foreign minister, met Mr Coveney after returning from a three day European trip where he met the leaders of Germany, France and the United Kingdom for talks focused on Iran.Ahead of a Thursday night’s meeting in Jerusalem Mr Coveney reiterated Irish support for the two-state solution.After talks in Ramallah on Thursday afternoon with Palestinian officials, Mr Coveney urged the parties to make progress despite the recent challenges they have faced.“My third visit to Palestine and Israel in less than a year is a reaffirmation of Ireland’s, and my own personal, commitment to and support for the two-state solution, which I believe offers the only prospect for a peaceful and secure future for both Israel and Palestine,” he said. “I heard how Israeli settlement expansion is continuing to erode the rights of the Palestinian people, and reduce the possibility of establishing a contiguous and sovereign Palestinian state.”Some 130 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops on the Gaza border over the last 10 weeks and massive protests are planned for Friday, the final weekend of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Palestinian foreign minister Riad al Malki briefed Mr Coveney on developments in Gaza and the status of Jerusalem in light of the recent American recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and the transfer of its embassy to the holy city.The two men also discussed ways to strengthen bilateral relations and promote economic ties, including the possibility of increasing scholarships for Palestinian students seeking to study in Ireland.Mr al Malki, who was joined in the talks by Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and Mohammad Shtayyeh, the head of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction, thanked Ireland for its support for the Palestinian cause. He praised Mr Coveney for summoning the Israeli ambassador to protest the events on the Gaza border, and his support for the West Bank Bedouin community of Khan al-Ahmar, faced with eviction by the Israeli authorities.For his part, Mr Coveney stressed that Dublin’s positions on all issues related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are fully consistent with international law and relevant United Nations resolutions, pointing out Ireland’s desire to see the Palestinians achieve reconciliation and unity.In Jordan on Wednesday, on the first leg of his four-day Middle East trip, Mr Coveney met his Jordanian counterpart Ayman Safadi and visited the Zaatari refugee camp to see first-hand how Jordan is coping with the influx of 1.3 million refugees from the Syrian civil war.He praised Jordan’s “great humanitarian role” in hosting Syrian refugees and stressed the need for the international community to continue to provide the necessary support.On Friday, on the final stop of his visit to the region, Mr Coveney will meet his Cypriot counterpart Nicos Christodoulides in Nicosia and with the special representative of the UN Secretary General and head of UNFICYP (United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus), Elizabeth Spehar.

Hints have been found before, but this is the best evidence yet.The organic molecules preserved in 3.5 billion-year-old bedrock in Gale Crater - believed to once contain a shallow lake - suggest conditions back then may have been conducive to life. That leaves open the possibility that microorganisms once populated our planetary neighbour and might still exist there.The chances of being able to find signs of ancient life with future missions, if life ever was present, just went up, said Curiosity’s project scientist, Ashwin Vasavada of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.Curiosity also has confirmed sharp seasonal increases of methane in the Martian atmosphere. Researchers said they can’t rule out a biological source. Most of Earth’s atmospheric methane comes from animal and plant life, and the environment itself.The two studies appear in the journal Science. In a companion article, an outside expert describes the findings as breakthroughs in astrobiology.The question of whether life might have originated or existed on Mars is a lot more opportune now that we know that organic molecules were present on its surface at the time, wrote Utrecht University astrobiologist Inge Loes ten Kate of the Netherlands.Kirsten Siebach, a Rice University geologist who also was not involved in the studies, is equally excited. She said the discoveries break down some of the strongest arguments put forward by life-on-Mars sceptics, herself included.The big takeaway is that we can find evidence. We can find organic matter preserved in mudstones that are more than 3 billion years old, Siebach said. And we see releases of gas today that could be related to life in the subsurface or at the very least are probably related to warm water or environments where Earth life would be happy living.The methane observations provide one of the most compelling cases for present-day life, she said.Scientists agree more powerful spacecraft - and, ideally, rocks returned to Earth from Mars - are needed to prove whether tiny organisms like bacteria ever existed on the red planet.Curiosity’s methane measurements occurred over 4 ½ Earth years, covering parts of three Martian years. Seasonal peaks were detected in late summer in the northern hemisphere and late winter in the southern hemisphere.JPL’s Christopher Webster, lead author on the study, said it’s the first time Martian methane has shown a repeated pattern. The magnitude of these seasonal peaks - by a factor of three - was far more than scientists expected. We were just blown away, he said. It’s tripling ... that’s a huge, huge difference.Webster theorises the methane created either now or long ago is seeping from deep underground reservoirs up through cracks and fissures in the crust. Once at the surface, the methane sticks to dirt and rocks, with more released into the atmosphere when it’s hotter.We have no proof that the methane is formed biologically, but we cannot rule it out, even with this new data set, Webster said.Scientists have been seeking organic molecules on Mars ever since the 1976 Viking landers. The twin Vikings came up pretty much empty.Arriving at Mars in 2012 with a drill and its own onboard labs, Curiosity confirmed the presence of organics in rocks in 2013, but the molecules weren’t exactly what scientists expected. So they looked elsewhere. The key samples in the latest findings came from a spot 4 miles away.Signs of life in our Solar SystemAs with methane, there could well be non-biological explanations for the presence of carbon-containing molecules on Mars, such as geologic processes or impacts by asteroids, comet, meteors and interplanetary dust.Jennifer Eigenbrode, an astrobiologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre in Greenbelt, Maryland who led the organics study, said she’s intrigued by the possibility that life might have existed and adapted on Mars.I’m equally as fascinated by the idea that life never got started on Mars in the first place. That’s a harder question to address scientifically, but I think that we need to give the search for life on Mars due diligence. We need to go to places that we think are the most likely places to find it.Please review our commenting policyCarol Vorderman reveals she was paid three times more than Richard Whiteley for CountdownPippa Middleton confirms pregnancy and reveals she escaped morning sickness unlike her sister KateLove Island 2018: From contestants to recoupling, a beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new seriesDonald Trump \u0026#39tired of Theresa May\u0026#39s school mistress tone’ and will not hold talks with her at G7Brexit backstop idea explained - and how it could prevent a hard Irish borderCannabis shops set to open in Canada by autumn after Senate approves legalisationTrump lashes out at Macron and \u0026#39indignant\u0026#39 host Trudeau ahead of tense G7 meetingTheresa May will have formal meetings with the leaders of all the G7 - except Donald TrumpSons of Anarchy star Alan O\u0026#39Neill found dead, aged 47Comment: In the rush to focus on Brexit and the NHS, we must not forget about spending on defence Comment: You can\u0026#39t stop your cats loving other people – but they can damn well stop feeding them Donald Trump will invite Kim Jong-un to White House if Singapore summit goes wellBrexit backstop: An iceberg lies dead ahead, yet we have no planMan dies after being shot in MerseysideMoped gang armed with zombie-style knife jump on car bonnet after stealing watches from driver and passengerRussian police may turn a blind eye to crimes against British fans during the World Cup, say MPs\u0026#39Lamentable\u0026#39 failings mean hospitals risk being overwhelmed by needless admissions White House planning to use federal prisons to house suspected illegal immigrantsWarning for holidaymakers as plastic pollution in the Mediterranean reaches new heightsBrexit has created \u0026#39new ide\u0026#39 in SNP, study finds ahead of party conferenceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 8 june 2018","story":"Founder\u0027s Day Parade at Royal Hospital Chelsea, a screening of Gladiator at the Colosseum in Rome and a violin made of drift wood are some of Friday\u0027s pictures of the dayCarol Vorderman reveals she was paid three times more than Richard Whiteley for CountdownPippa Middleton confirms pregnancy and reveals she escaped morning sickness unlike her sister KateLove Island 2018: From contestants to recoupling, a beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new seriesDonald Trump \u0026#39tired of Theresa May\u0026#39s school mistress tone’ and will not hold talks with her at G7Brexit backstop idea explained - and how it could prevent a hard Irish borderCannabis shops set to open in Canada by autumn after Senate approves legalisationTrump lashes out at Macron and \u0026#39indignant\u0026#39 host Trudeau ahead of tense G7 meetingTheresa May will have formal meetings with the leaders of all the G7 - except Donald TrumpSons of Anarchy star Alan O\u0026#39Neill found dead, aged 47Comment: In the rush to focus on Brexit and the NHS, we must not forget about spending on defence Comment: You can\u0026#39t stop your cats loving other people – but they can damn well stop feeding them Donald Trump will invite Kim Jong-un to White House if Singapore summit goes wellLife on Mars?

Could I still work my abs?It\u0027s particularly hard in the early months when you don\u0027t really want to share the news with everyone, not even your class instructor.After doing some research, she said she adapted her current routine and worked out for 45 minutes, three to four times a week.Pippa Middleton says has now given up running while she is pregnantShe said she had given up jogging because she liked the idea of giving my body (and growing baby) a rest from pavement pounding.Instead, when she wasn\u0027t in the gym and taking part in classes such as yoga and Pilates, she would walk, cycle, swim and play tennis.I\u0027ve noticed my body change and weight increase, but through effective exercise and sports I feel that it\u0027s being strengthened to support a healthy pregnancy, birth and recovery.Pippa Middleton and James Matthews arrive for the wedding ceremony of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle She said she avoided strenuous abs pull-ups and instead was conscious of holding my tummy in (as if giving your baby a hug) to support my back and ensure that post-baby, my old favourite jeans will still fit ...  eventually.Speculation over Ms Middleton\u0027s pregnancy first emerged in April, days before the birth of the Duke and Duchess\u0027 third child, Prince Louis.Mrs Middleton married Mr Matthews in May last year, with the cream of high society in attendance.Duchess of CambridgePlease review our commenting policyCarol Vorderman reveals she was paid three times more than Richard Whiteley for CountdownLove Island 2018: From contestants to recoupling, a beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new seriesDonald Trump \u0026#39tired of Theresa May\u0026#39s school mistress tone’ and will not hold talks with her at G7Brexit backstop idea explained - and how it could prevent a hard Irish borderCannabis shops set to open in Canada by autumn after Senate approves legalisationTrump lashes out at Macron and \u0026#39indignant\u0026#39 host Trudeau ahead of tense G7 meetingTheresa May will have formal meetings with the leaders of all the G7 - except Donald TrumpSons of Anarchy star Alan O\u0026#39Neill found dead, aged 47Comment: In the rush to focus on Brexit and the NHS, we must not forget about spending on defence Comment: You can\u0026#39t stop your cats loving other people – but they can damn well stop feeding them Donald Trump will invite Kim Jong-un to White House if Singapore summit goes wellLife on Mars?

On “The Ultracheese” the descending piano chords symbol a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.In a comment piece about the early reactions to the album, culture reporter Jacob Stolworthy also noted how the band were lightyears away from their debut album.The fact is, these four musicians have fully submerged themselves into this venture, into this defined hotel and casino, and are inviting you to check in and do the same, he wrote.Its theatrical production and refined vocal delivery - heavily sprinkled with Turner\u0027s natural musicality and love of Dion, Serge Gainsbourg and The Beach Boys - is the kind that will unlock new doors with each listen.​See more of Aaron Parson\u0027s photography on his website.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

After further study of the field at New York’s Bellevue Hospital, she returned to Columbia as director of its new anaesthesia ision, its first female head of department.Building the unit from the ground up in partnership with her old mentor Dr Allen Whipple\u0026nbsp(who had steered her away from surgery), Dr Apgar\u0026nbspworked tireless as both a practising physician and administrator, no easy task when America’s entry into the Second World War in 1941 created significant staffing shortages.Dr Apgar\u0026nbspdeveloped her five-point score for assessing\u0026nbspnewborn health\u0026nbspin 1952. The test grades babies on scores of zero to two on five key criteria: the colour of their skin, their pulse rate, their reflex ability, their responsiveness to limb flexion and their respiratory rate. The resulting scores are totted up to give a total out of 10 indicating the health or otherwise of the infant in question.The criteria can be remembered by the acronym\u0026nbsp”Apgar”, standing for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration.In 1959, by which point her test had been rolled out across US maternity\u0026nbsphospitals, Dr Apgar\u0026nbspleft the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center to\u0026nbspearn\u0026nbspa Master of Public Health degree from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health and served as vice president for medical affairs at the March of Dimes Foundation to advance the study of birth defects.She was an outspoken advocate for universal vaccinations\u0026nbspto prevent mother-to-child transmission of rubella during the pandemic that struck 12.5m people in the US between 1964-65 and contributed more than 60 articles to newspapers, magazines and academic journals, publishing her book Is My Baby All Right? with Joan Beck\u0026nbspin 1973.Dr Apgar\u0026nbspwas known throughout her career for her warm bedside manner and forthright optimism. In her personal life, she played the violin, enjoyed a range of hobbies from fly-fishing and stamp collecting\u0026nbspand took flying lessons, dreaming of swooping under the George Washington Bridge.Although\u0026nbspshe rarely campaigned against or spoke publicly about gender inequalities, Dr Virginia Apgar\u0026nbspglided past\u0026nbspthe sexism of her period with ease, preferring instead to lead by example and allow her professional excellence and commitment to her work speak for itself.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

But now here she is, a teenager, and we are watching Love Island together.I am a Love Island virgin, which are three words you won’t hear together very much over the next eight weeks. I have never seen it before, and am only vaguely aware of it. That isn’t to say I’m some television snob I’ve watched copious amounts of Big Brother. I do like I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!. I have caught myself laughing at Mrs Brown’s Boys. I even saw The Chase once.But somehow, Love Island has been slightly beyond the periphery of my experience. I mean, I’ve never seen The Only Way is Essex, but I feel like I have. Love Island, though… my reality TV filter must be clogged, and the past three\u0026nbspseries of it have been caught up in the webbing, never really permeating even my subconscious mind.I have a vague idea that Love Island is some combination of castaways having to undergo Bear Grylls-style survivalist trials crossed with the sort of orgy the Marquis de Sade might have dreamed about after eating a particularly pungent cheese too close to bedtime.So, here we are, settling in front of ITV2, my teenage daughter and I. My wife questions the wisdom of Alice encouraging me to watch a programme which, she informs me, will feature a parade of nubile young women in bikinis, as though I am a pensioner in a comedy sketch who might have a heart attack. But I am insistent Alice and her friends have been frantically Snapchatting all evening in excitement at the prospect of series four of Love Island. This will help me get down with the kids, I am sure of it.I ask Alice for a brief précis of what it’s all about as the titles start. She tells me that there will be more boys than girls and everyone has to couple up but the spare boy then has to steal a girl from\u0026nbspone of the others and at the end of the first round the boy without a girl is unceremoniously dumped from the show.How utterly awful, I think. And is there a point to it all? Apparently, yes £50,000 for the last couple standing. And, apparently, “Instagram promotions”, whatever that might entail. But wait monogamy is not the name of the game. Every so often there has to be a process of “recoupling”, says Alice, which sounds to me like something unpleasant from an episode of 1970s sci-fi series Logan’s Run.This, I ponder, is going to be an interminable couple of months. Surely they must do something other than pant over each other? Yes, Alice says. There are tasks and challenges. What, like they have to catch fish and find coconuts and stuff?She laughs. No, not like that at all. And as the first of the female contestants begins to arrive, I start to understand. This is not so much Bear Grylls as Bare Arse. The girls are deposited at a posh hotel inidually, via Jeep, dressed in the teeniest, tiniest of bikinis. There is Samira, who is a dancer, Hayley, who is a model, Kendall, who manages a shoe shop. They are wearing a handkerchief’s worth of fabric between them. By the time Danny Dyer’s daughter rocks up, I am secretly wishing someone would put some clothes on. I must be getting old.I lose track of who is who because I’ve had a sudden moment of dissonance. The voiceover guy has a Scottish accent that sounds awfully familiar. It is Iain Stirling, Alice informs me. “Don’t you remember? He used to be on CBBC.”Oh my God. He’s the fresh-faced young chap who used to come on with Hacker T Dog. I always had a fondness for Hacker because he was from Wigan, like me. And now his mate Iain is narrating this cesspit. I look at my daughter, and remember those years of Tracy Beaker and Dora the Explorer. Truly, the days of innocence are over.I ask Alice, cautiously, nervously, if she looks up to these girls, whose makeup has more mass than their clothing and who are talking about willies. She rolls her eyes. “It’s just entertainment, Dad.” I think there are five practically naked girls cavorting on screen now, but to be quite honest I’m eyeing up the fire pit on the sun terrace. Is it gas powered? Where does the canister go?But here comes Caroline Flack, presiding over things like some brothel keeper in a Wild West frontier town. Because that’s exactly what it feels like when the boys turn up, one by one, like cattlemen who have been on the trail too long, excitedly wringing their stetsons and being invited by Flack to inspect the lineup of girl flesh on offer and take their pick.Oh, the girls do have a tiny bit of agency they are allowed to take a step forward if the boy in front of them takes their fancy. But ultimately, the guy gets to choose, though I am told these roles reverse in the coming days.The boys are all rippling six packs and tattoos. There’s one called Niall, who seems sweetly funny, and a guy called Wes, who claims to be some kind of engineer in the nuclear industry, except he’s having trouble saying the word “nuclear”. He gives up and falls back on some double entendre, which I’m 100 per cent sure some researcher has not written for him, promising with a leery wink to “engineer the ride of someone’s life” and then, if that was a bit too subtle, says something about having a big gear stick.My wife, no doubt thinking ahead to getting up at 6.30am today, wonders just how these people get eight weeks off work to do this. And that’s never more pressing a question than when Alex turns up. He’s an A\u0026ampE doctor. How can they spare him? He’s presumably done six years of medical school so he can try to crack off with a girl on a televised Club 18-30 holiday. Doesn’t he know how hard-pressed the NHS is? Hasn’t he seen 24 Hours in A\u0026ampE?Half an hour in and I try to get into the spirit of things by betting my daughter a fiver (I know, I know, the sheer crimes of moral turpitude we have descended to) that a boy whose name sounds like\u0026nbspEeyore, but is Eyal, will pick Samira, the dancer, who seems quite switched on compared to the others. I lose the wager. I’m disappointed in Eyal. I thought he had more about him.We meet Jack, who has the most astonishingly white teeth I have ever seen in my life. Apparently he went all the way to Turkey to get them done. You could see the glow of his teeth from the International Space Station.\u0026nbspI have drifted off when someone says, in what context I know not, that it’s “too soon to spoon!” Is it too soon to switch over and watch Lucy Worsley cosplaying a suffragette, I wonder?By this point I am finding it all quite dreadful, and not because I’m old. It’s because it reminds me of what it was like to be young. If you were ever left standing tearfully at the end of musical chairs, if you ever were picked last for games, if you ever walked home alone from a disco and listened to “How Soon Is Now?” by The Smiths on repeat while staring mournfully at your Betty Blue poster, if despite your best efforts you could only ever cultivate the physique of Little Plum from The Beano, then Love Island is a hateful parade of everything you wanted to be but weren’t.I look at Alice. God, I think, please don’t ever be so shallow as these people. But she’s on Snapchat with her friends. One of them likes Jack, he of the luminous gnashers. Alice pulls a face. Who do you like best, I ask? Eyal.Back on screen, Eyal is indeed coming across as, relatively, deep. He is trying to explain to Hayley, the model, what the word “superficial” means. There’s a new guy arrived, called Adam, whose job is to break up one of the couples and get his chosen girl to be with him. It’s becoming like a standard night out, except there are no fights. Apparently giving someone who tries to steal your girl a good shoeing is verboten and gets you kicked out.A little too late, perhaps, I start to wonder if this is really appropriate for Alice. But she has already seen the latest season of 13 Reasons Why, and also informs us that she has watched a movie called Ibiza that is trailed in the ad break which seems to be very heavy on jokes revolving around male ejaculation. Where did those Dora the Explorer days go? When Adam is going round trying to steal girls I want to shout at the screen, “Swiper no swiping!” But it would just make me sad.Everyone goes to sleep, the “couples” sharing beds. They are young and full of self-esteem, and no one is in their forties\u0026nbspand worried about snoring or accidental nocturnal flatulence. As far as I can tell, nobody has sex, which is a relief. It’s probably the best night’s kip Alex the A\u0026ampE doctor has had for years.Are you embarrassed watching this with me, I ask.\u0026nbspAlice shrugs. “Not on the first episode,” she says. “I probably would be, later on.” It will, I am told, get heavy later on. I am slightly aghast. People will actually have sex? On the telly?There was one couple that didn’t last year, says Alice. One couple that didn’t do it? Only one? I’m not sure whether to feel proud of them or sorry for them.It feels like this is going to be a very long eight weeks, daily doses of people pretty much doing the same thing over and over again. A bit like Dora the Explorer. And even with the salacious promise of off-screen sex among these beautiful, vacuous people, I imagine it’s going to be less the Marquis de Sade’s 120 Days of Sodom than 56 Days of Sod All.It’s too much time to devote to these people, and I’m afraid Alice might be on her own – with her pals on Snapchat of course – for the rest of Love Island. I gave it a go and it at best bored me, at worst made me feel vaguely angry and depressed.Though I might tune in tonight, just to see who gets kicked out after last night’s cliffhanger…or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

While the discovery does not shed light on whether Mars was once home to alien life,\u0026nbspand whether it could still be,\u0026nbspthe findings could be the result of ancient life there.“The chances of being able to find signs of ancient life with future missions, if life ever was present, just went up,” said Curiosity’s project scientist, Ashwin Vasavada of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\u0026nbspExperts say that the findings should propel us to look for conclusive evidence of alien life living on the planet.“With these new findings, Mars is telling us to stay the course and keep searching for evidence of life,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at Nasa\u0026nbspheadquarters\u0026nbspin Washington. “I’m confident that our ongoing and planned missions will unlock even more breathtaking discoveries on the Red Planet.”The new announcement is actually the result of two\u0026nbspnew studies that reveal vast\u0026nbspdetail about how methane exists on the planet, as well as the unexpected organic molecules that are preserved in its soil.And one team has made a significant breakthrough in our attempt to understand the ancient organic matter on Mars, which could help us discover\u0026nbspwhether the world was once habitable and what happened to it in the billions of years since.The surface of Mars is inhospitable today. But in the past, it almost certainly had liquid water, which could have helped fuel life there.The Curiosity rover has headed to an area that was thought to once have been a large lake of that water, inside Gale Crater. It was inside that hole where scientists found the new findings, which suggest the\u0026nbspwater lake had all the necessary ingredients for life – from chemical building blocks\u0026nbspto the energy sources required to sustain life.\u0026nbspThe two studies appear in the journal Science. In a companion article, an outside expert describes the findings as “breakthroughs in astrobiology”.\u0026nbsp“The question of whether life might have originated or existed on Mars is a lot more opportune now that we know that organic molecules were present on its surface at the time,” wrote Utrecht University astrobiologist Inge Loes ten Kate of the Netherlands.\u0026nbspKirsten Siebach, a Rice University geologist who was also not involved in the studies, is equally excited. She said the discoveries break down some of the strongest arguments put forward by life-on-Mars sceptics, herself included.\u0026nbsp“The big takeaway is that we can find evidence. We can find organic matter preserved in mudstones that are more than 3 billion years old,” Ms Siebach said. “And we see releases of gas today that could be related to life in the subsurface, or at the very least are probably related to warm water or environments where Earth life would be happy living.”\u0026nbspThe methane observations provide “one of the most compelling” cases for present-day life, she said.\u0026nbspScientists have long been baffled by the discovery of significant amounts of methane on Mars. On Earth, most methane is produced by biological sources, leading to hopes\u0026nbspthe Red Planet is more alive than we had thought.The new data suggests\u0026nbspthe methane is being stored underneath the surface of the planet. Seasonal changes appear to bring that methane out and onto the surface, where it has been detected by Curiosity,\u0026nbspsuggest the scientists.Another piece of research published simultaneously shows that intriguing organic molecules have been found in ancient rock on Mars. Curiosity took new samples and heated them so that it could analyse the molecules that were released – and the data showed there is certain matter\u0026nbspsimilar to the kind of organic-rich rock found on Earth.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Also, they are organised in repeated groups, as expected if the animal had multiple paired appendages.”Previously, no evidence of limbed animals had been discovered that pre-dated the Cambrian Explosion, the sudden surge in ersity that occurred on Earth around 510 to 540 million years ago.Unusually, the footprints of the creature in question appear to be irregular and disorganised, suggesting it was somewhat clumsy.In the paper published on the findings, researchers said tracks bore a resemblance to fossil prints recorded\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspDunure and Montrose in Scotland, thought to be between\u0026nbsp419 and 358 million years old.The new find does not however provide scientists with enough information to determine what kind of animal the footprints\u0026nbspbelonged to.“We explicitly stated in the paper that we do not know exactly what animals made these footprints, other than that the animals must have been bilaterally symmetric because they had paired appendages,” Dr Xiao added.“At least three living groups of animals have paired appendages – arthropods such as bumble bees, annelids such as bristle worms, and tetrapods such as humans.\u0026nbsp“Arthropods and annelids, or their ancestors, are possibilities and modern arthropods and annelids provide appropriate analogue to guide our interpretation of these fossils.\u0026nbsp“But unless the animal died and preserved next to its footprints, it is hard to say with confidence who made the footprints.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We now know that every form of Brexit will damage our country and threaten jobs and livelihoods, and even the prime minister is now admitting we are heading for a terrible deal.”Meanwhile, one of Boris Johnson’s ministers provoked fresh controversy when he suggested a second EU referendum on the final Brexit deal would be “possible”.Sir Alan Duncan told an audience in Berlin that voters would not be allowed to reverse the original decision to leave the EU but they would get “the choice would be between the exit deal on offer or having no deal at all”.It comes as MPs gear up for weeks of parliamentary warfare over preparations for leaving the EU, as it was announced that two key Brexit bills will return to the Commons.Cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom revealed that the long-delayed trade and customs bills will both be debated by MPs in mid-July, following speculation the government has kicked the vital legislation into the long grass over fears of conflict with pro-EU rebels.Her announcement came ahead of next week’s Commons showdown over Ms May’s flagship Brexit legislation – the EU (Withdrawal) Bill – where ministers will seek to overturn all 15 Lords defeats during a fraught two-day contest.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I find it particularly interesting that the Israeli tweet uses a meme with women to react to the Ayatollah\u0026nbspKhamenei’s tweet.”Israel’s Mean Girls gif had been retweeted more than 9,000 times and liked more than 27,000 times within a day of being posted.The Twitter exchange came amid growing tensions in the Middle East since Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions on Iran.\u0026nbspOn Tuesday, Benjamin\u0026nbspNetanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, sought to convince European states to abandon the deal, claiming Tehran’s threats to increase uranium enrichment capacity showed it still planned to destroy Israel.Britain, France and Germany are scrambling to\u0026nbspsave the accord, under which Iran\u0026nbsppromised to curb its nuclear programme in return for lifted sanctions.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If he fires at us, we will destroy his forces\u0027​Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to carry out direct military strikes targeting President Bashar al-Assad’s regime unless all Iranian forces are withdrawn from Syria.\u0026nbspThe aggressive ultimatum to Damascus is a significant escalation in the confrontation in Syria between Israel and Iran.The Syrian leader was “no longer immune, his regime is no longer immune. If he fires at us, we will destroy his forces,”\u0026nbspMr Netanyahu declared during a visit to London, speaking at a question and answer session at the Policy Exchange think tank.Israel has carried out a number of air strikes on Iranian bases in Syria and has repeatedly demanded that Iran, which it considers “an existential threat”, must remove its forces and weapons from Syria.But this was the first time that it had been stated that the Assad regime would be punished for the presence of Iranian forces, which have been fighting Isis\u0026nbspand Islamist rebels.Mr Netanyahu said: “I think there is a new calculus that has to take place and Syria has to understand that Israel will not tolerate the Iranian military entrenchment in Syria against Israel.“The consequences are not merely to the Iranian forces there but to the Assad regime as well, I think it’s something that he should consider very seriously.”The Israeli prime minister blamed Assad personally for the presence of Tehran’s forces in Syria as he warned of possible Israeli intervention.“Assad has to consider this: when they waged this horrific civil war, Israel did not intervene. Now the war is nearly over, he invites Iran in to entrench itself?” \u0026nbspThe Syrian leader was accused of facilitating Tehran “to move its army a thousand miles so it can threaten Israel. They want to bring in precision guided rockets with half a ton warheads and submarines to the Mediterranean… Iran does not believe in a master race, it believes in a master faith,” and is bent on conquest, Mr Netanyahu charged.The prime minister is on a tour of Western Europe to try to drum up support for further action against Iran, after US President Donald Trump reneged on an agreement between international powers and Tehran over its nuclear programme.The other signatories to the deal – Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China – as well as the United Nations have all stressed that it was working and the Iranian government was abiding by its commitment.Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Theresa May have told Mr Netanyahu that they are\u0026nbspdetermined not to abandon the agreement, the scrapping of which could lead to nuclear proliferation in the region and beyond, they warned.That, he boasted, had been effectively destroyed by him and Mr Trump.He warned European businesses of the punitive fines they would face under American sanctions if they continued trading with Iran.Mr Netanyahu stated that his aim on the trip, instead, was to “expose” how “Iran is devouring one nation after another” and ask Western European governments to do more “about reversing Iran’s aggression in the region and getting them out of Syria”.The French, German and British leaders have all raised their concerns with Mr Netanyahu about the recent brutal violence at the Gaza border in which dozens of Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli troops.The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, urged the Israeli government to open an independent inquiry into the deaths and injuries suffered during the protests.Asked at the London meeting why non-lethal methods, such as water cannons and rubber bullets, were not used, or even a policy of shooting at legs, rather than shoot to kill, not pursued, Mr Netanyahu insisted: “We have tried all these methods, they don’t work. These were not non-violent protests, quite the contrary.“We are doing everything we can to both minimise casualties and, at the same time, protect Israeli lives.”Referring to Israel’s success in technological innovations, Mr Netanyahu added “given our record, we probably will figure something out, but we haven’t got there yet. The last thing we want is violence or confrontation.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The European Commission\u0026rsquos chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said this could change with the right post-Brexit treaty or agreement in place.Despite the ruckus, Brussels has seemingly got one up on the UK with the EU\u0026rsquos decision to strengthen its negotiating arm by planning to give the go-ahead for procuring the next set of satellites after EU bosses agreed to assume all liabilities that the ESA would incur taking on the contract.Britain has previously hoped to use the need for an unanimous vote to stop any advances in Galileo by choosing to veto any new contracts.However, thanks to the EU\u0026rsquos willingness to accept any liabilities a simple majority is only required in order to push through the new contracts.The UK\u0026rsquos veto threat has already set the new batch of satellites back by at least but the British blockade will be manoeuvred around at the next vote on June 13.Brussels is likely to get sufficient support from member states with many of the EU27, including Germany, opting to side with the Commission\u0026rsquos tough negotiating stance on Galileo.According to sources familiar with the negotiations have said a group of member states have expressed their surprise at the \u0026ldquohardline tactics adopted by EU negotiators.They said the Commission\u0026rsquos stance \u0026ldquodoes not represent the wider European security view.The source added a number of member states had expressed \u0026ldquoa lot of surprise at the hardline the Commission has taken."},{"url":null,"title":"weather","story":"A BLAST of roasting air from Africa is about to engulf Britain triggering the start of what is...BRITAIN is set to bask in warm sunshine as a hot weather system returns to the country after a...A BARRAGE of deadly thunderstorms poised to lash Britain within hours has sparked warnings for...STORM Alberto is bringing torrential downpours to the southern states of the US, despite being...BRITAIN was hit by the mother of all thunderstorms as Saturday\u0027s balmy evening broke into...BBC Weather meteorologists warned Britain could face heavy downpours and thundery showers ahead...UK weather is set to be a scorcher for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s Royal Wedding, with the...BBC Weather has forecast the UK to be hit with rainy conditions in the coming hours as the...A TIDE of pollution about to sweep in on a plume of roasting air from the Continent has sparked...THE UK is set to bake in warm weather this Bank Holiday weekend, as forecasts show temperatures..."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/183x122/969141_1.jpg","title":"UK weather forecast latest hot weather weekend Met Office summer 2018","story":"Blue skies and golden rays are expected to hold out into the middle of June although some experts say it could be longer.Many forecasters now agree temperatures for the month as a whole are likely to come in higher than average.Britain\u0026rsquos weather will turn steadily warmer in the run-up to the weekend with highs of between 20C (68F) and 24C (75.2F) expected widely.A tropical plume from Africa and the Continent will nudge the mercury even higher in parts of Britain from Saturday.Warmth and humidity will raise the risk of violent thundery downpours towards the end of the week, government forecasters warned.

Instead, Brexit has made both independence and the SNP relatively less popular among those Scots who are not very enthusiastic about the EU, even if they did vote to Remain.“So far this has been a tendency to presume that the fall in SNP support in the 2017 election simply represented a rejection of the party’s plans for a second independence referendum.“Our research suggests that it was also occasioned by a dislike of its pro-EU stance among some of former SNP voters.He added: “Meanwhile, far from simply winning votes as a result of her opposition to a second independence referendum, Ruth Davidson appears to have profited from a swing among Leave voters.“That leaves Ms Davidson with an electorate whose views on Europe are in many cases strikingly different from her own.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His first arrest was in 1992 but it took another 23 years before his victims were taken seriously.Aides of Charles said this week that the royal is prepared to send a witness statement to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), answering whatever questions it has. Ball, lauded for his work alongside vulnerable youths, was also close to then Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey.Last year, a report found that Lord Carey, now 82, and other senior Church of England figures “colluded” with Ball to prevent him facing criminal charges and failed to protect his victims.But Ball’s gilded life in the top echelons of the Church of England came crashing down in October 2015, when he was jailed for sexual offences against boys as young as 15, dating from the late Seventies to the early Nineties.His trial heard how he chose young priests to share his bed, forced them to take cold showers while he watched, and got one man to roll naked in the snow before towelling him dry and beating him until he bled.Ball is now a free man living in Somerset, having served half of his 32-month sentence. His rise to power began in 1960 when he established a monastery in Gloucestershire with twin brother Michael, also a bishop.Ball became known for showing “favouritism” to novice monks, and he embraced the opportunity to speak in schools. It later emerged that was where he met five of his victims. As his influence grew within the Church he constructed a powerful social network, regularly dining with Margaret Thatcher at posh London hotel The Savoy, often in his monk’s habit.When he became Bishop of Gloucester in 1992, it was not long before he used his position to get close to Charles, whose Highgrove estate came under his diocese. This friendship was tested that December when Ball was arrested for the first time for gross indecency.One of his trainees, 16-year-old Neil Todd, alleged that Ball had forced him to rehearse “penitential psalms” naked in the middle of the night so he could “feel the cold”.Ball made him take cold showers and expressed a desire to whip Neil so badly his body would “bear the marks”.Another six young victims came forward with similar stories after Neil reported the abuse to the police.As part of Ball’s 2015 trial, the court heard that, backed by “Cabinet ministers, the Royal Family, MPs, JPs and a lord”, he escaped with a caution over the 1992 allegations.He quit as Bishop of Gloucester and settled into retirement in a Duchy of Cornwall property rented to him by Prince Charles in the village of Aller, Somerset. He was still allowed to officiate at services, including more than 20 at schools.According to an independent report commissioned by Archbishop Justin Welby and published last year by Dame Moira Gibb, Ball’s brother, Bishop Michael Ball, wrote at the end of 1992 to Lord Carey, saying his brother was receiving support from prominent figures.It emerged that Lord Carey had lobbied police and prosecutors on Ball’s behalf, while treating the disgraced bishop to a holiday and a £12,500 pay-off.Dame Moira wrote: “Peter Ball abused many boys and men. That is shocking in itself but is compounded by the failure of the Church to respond appropriately to his misconduct.”But it was Ball’s friendship with “confidant” Charles that is seen as most alarming.As well as regularly corresponding, praying together and attending Charles’s 2005 nuptials, he was invited to address mourners at the funeral of Major Bruce Shand, the Duchess of Cornwall’s father, in 2006.Lord Carey retired in 2002 and was succeeded by Rowan Williams, who in 2007 announced the Church would investigate historic sex cases. A 2008 Church review of Ball’s case found seven letters of complaint received by Lambeth Palace in 1992 had been ignored, with revelations of nakedness, masturbation and assault.These were disclosed to police and Operation Dunhill was launched in July 2012. After surviving two previous suicide attempts, victim Neil Todd took his own life, aged 38, after this new investigation began. Ball finally appeared at the Old Bailey in 2015. The trial heard from 18 victims but it is believed there were more than 100.Ball was jailed after admitting to two counts of indecent assault and a charge of misconduct in public office as part of a plea bargain He was released in February last year, and moved back to Aller.It is unclear whether he still lives in the rented Duchy property. A week-long examination of the case will take place next month, held by the IICSA.On Wednesday, counsel to the inquiry Fiona Scolding QC confirmed witness statements had been requested from Prince Charles and his private secretary.Charles’s name is in the clear — but is his conscience?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Foreign Secretary has been secretly recorded boasting to right-wing Tory activists about Brexit, Trump and North Korea at a private dinner.  Leaked to BuzzFeed News and The Times, the remarks are embarrassing at best. And at worst they\u0027re not only deeply unprofessional - they undermine the entire govenrment.  Mr Johnson steamrollered Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan and campaigned hard for his own vision in the address to Conservative Way Forward.  He ridiculed warnings about Brexit as pure millennium bug stuff, dismissed official claims his customs plan will cost \u0026pound20bn a year, and said: I\u0027m not going to hide it from you, there is an argument. A lot of this isn\u0027t surprising - and Tory MP Gerald Howarth today even said the tape serves a valuable purpose. But some of his comments went much, much further. Here we analyse the worst of what Boris said - and why it could come back to bite him. 1. Donald Trump should do Brexit   What he said: Boris said he is “increasingly admiring of Donald Trump and more and more convinced that there is method in his madness. Trump to negotiate Brexit , what a fantastic idea... Imagine Trump doing Brexit. He’d go in bloody hard. There’d be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he’d gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere. It’s a very, very good thought.”   Why it\u0027s a problem: This exposes the way Boris thinks - preferring chaos to his boss\u0027s \u0027strong and stable\u0027 mantra. It inflates the US President\u0027s large ego just as the world is supposed to be taking him down a peg over steel tariffs. And it\u0027s a direct attack on Theresa May, suggesting she\u0027s inferior to another world leader and not getting anywhere with her Brexit talks.  2. Brexit will trigger a meltdown and the EU is the \u0027enemy\u0027   What he said: “I think Theresa is going to go into a phase where we are much more combative with Brussels. You’ve got to face the fact there may now be a meltdown. OK? I don’t want anybody to panic during the meltdown. No panic. Pro bono publico, no bloody panic. It’s going to be all right in the end.... Take the fight to the enemy - absolutely right. We need to and we will.   Why it\u0027s a problem: It\u0027s utterly extraordinary that a minister is admitting his own strategy will trigger a \u0027meltdown\u0027 and could cause \u0027panic\u0027. It\u0027s also hugely damaging to Theresa May\u0027s constant efforts to tell Brussels she\u0027s approaching Brexit talks in a co-operative way.  3. The \u0027heart of Remain\u0027 Treasury is a \u0027quivering wreck\u0027   What he said: The Treasury, which is basically the heart of Remain... What they don’t want is friction at the borders. They don’t want any disruption of the economy. So they’re sacrificing all the medium and long-term gains out of fear of short-term disruption. Do you see what I\u0027m saying? The fear of short-term disruption has become so huge in people’s minds that they’ve turned into a quivering wreck. The Project Fear is irreversible! They’re terrified of this nonsense! It’s mumbo jumbo.   Why it\u0027s a problem: Again, it is extraordinary for a serving government minister to attack his own government like this. It\u0027s no secret that the Treasury, under Chancellor Philip Hammond, is pro-Remain. But here is Boris attacking civil servants too as terrified and quivering wrecks. It\u0027s certainly not in the spirit of collective responsibility, where each minister is meant to agree publicly with the whole government.  4. US has asked him to dismantle Kim\u0027s nuclear missile   What he said: Of course we’ve got to help the Americans do this thing…. I just talked to Mike Pompeo, my counterpart in the US State Department. What they want us to do is to use our nuclear expertise to dismantle Kim Jong-Un’s nuclear missile. That’s what he asked me to do today.”   Why it\u0027s a problem: Talks between allies are conducted in secret with only brief summaries provided to the media. Civil servants who work on national security go through exhaustive background checks and are given firm instructions not to talk about their work. This kind of highly sensitive detail is an extraordinary thing to be telling activists at a private dinner.  5.

Experts warn Three Lions supporters heading to Russia for the showpiece could be targeted by local thugs. They are particularly fearful for gay and ethnic minority fans at the tournament, which kicks off on Thursday. In a report, the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee warns the expected 10,000 supporters expected to travel from Britain: “Russia presents particular risks as a World Cup host, due to the history of violence by football hooligans intolerance and discriminatory state policy towards LGBT individuals the history of racist abuse in and around football matches current heightened political tensions and the threat of terrorist attacks.  “We remain concerned about the safety of UK fans travelling to Russia, and the apparent lack of specific provisions to protect targeted groups, particularly LGBT football fans.” Russian hooligans have a history of targeting minorities - and MPs believe yobs will use the World Cup to commit violence. “The far-right culture of Russian hooligan groups could place LGBT fans at particular risk of violence during the World Cup,” says the 28-page report. “As with LGBT football fans, the far-right culture of Russian hooligan groups could place BAME fans at a greater risk.” MPs were especially worried about fans visiting places outside the three cities where England play group matches: Volgograd, Nizhny Novgorod and Kaliningrad.  The report highlights the “additional consular support and rigorous security measures in place on match days in cities where England plays”. But it adds: “We are particularly concerned about the safety of UK fans outside these times and places and call on the FCO to do more to make fans aware of the distinction between arrangements in place on match and non-match ays and in England and non-England match cities.”  British officials based in Moscow who were drawing up plans for keeping fans safe during the football spectacle were among those kicked out by the Kremlin in tit-for-tat expulsions following the nerve agent poisoning of former KGB agent Sergei Skripal and is daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March.

The Labour leader makes the plea as the Prime Minister goes into showdown talks with the US President at the summit of G7 leaders in Canada. It will be Mrs May’s first face-to-face meeting with Trump since he imposed a 25% import tax on steel imports and 10% on aluminium . Mr Corbyn is calling on her to show true leadership by confronting the US leader over the tariffs. He says the taxes, which came into force a week ago and affect the EU, are “bad news” for British industry, putting our steel firms and tens of thousands of workers at risk.  The Labour leader writes in the Mirror: “The UK’s steel industry and its 32,000 employees are under threat from President Donald Trump’s reckless decision to jack up tariffs on steel. “Theresa May must take a lead at the summit in calling him out.” Mr Corbyn warns the tariffs are a scandal that she cannot remain silent over. He blasts the Prime Minister for lacking the “courage” so far to hold Mr Trump to account. He also accuses the Tories of failing to act because they are “in the hope of getting a quick trade deal with the US” after Brexit .

When the leaders of the world’s richest countries meet today in Canada, Britain will need our Prime Minister to stand up for the country’s workforce. The UK’s steel industry and its 32,000 employees are under threat from President Donald Trump’s reckless decision to jack up tariffs on steel, and Theresa May must take a lead at the summit in calling him out. The Trump tariffs are simply wrong.  They are bad news for British workers and industry. They are also bad news for US workers and industry. It is vital that all the leaders come together to condemn the Trump tariffs. We need to stop the escalation of a tit-for-tat trade war that can only be bad news for all workers and businesses. As I told the GMB trade union conference in Brighton this week, US workers are right to want a government that actively supports them and the real, everyday economy.  But the Trump tariffs don’t do that. And neither does the Trump agenda of giving handouts to the super-rich, while propping up a rigged system that hoards power and wealth for a tiny elite. Whether it’s over Trump’s Muslim ban and his shameless promotion of the far right Britain First group, his dangerous decision to abandon the Paris Climate Accord or his wilful tearing up of the Iran nuclear deal, Theresa May has repeatedly shown she doesn’t have the courage to stand up for what we all know to be right.  The Tories want to appease Trump in the hope of getting a quick trade deal with the US after we leave the European Union. But what their reaction to the Trump tariffs show is that with the timid Tories in government, we’ll end up with worst kind of race-to-the-bottom deal. That would hurt workers, consumers and our public services.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, his deputy Tom Watson, and even Tory Brexit minister Suella Braverman joined forces to back our call for recognition of Britain’s nuclear test heroes. They met Shirley Denson, 83, widow of RAF ace Eric who was subjected to radiation experiments, as well as Doug and Sandie Hern whose daughter Gilly died at the age of 13 after her dad was exposed to the fallout from five different bombs.  Corbyn told the Mirror: The UK government put these men in harm’s way by asking them to take part in nuclear tests with little to nothing by way of protection. The veterans have had to live and die with the repercussions ever since. “A medal is the first and least thing we can do to right the wrongs these veterans and families have endured, and I fully support the Mirror\u0027s campaign to give them the recognition they deserve.” It is an historic win for the Mirror’s campaign, as it is the first time any party leader has met a nuclear veteran and agreed to back them.  The MPs were joined by comedian Al Murray, better known as the Pub Landlord, who has joined the campaign. He said: “My dad and my father-in-law were both National Servicemen so they could have been in these tests. The same could be true for any one of us. “The Military Covenant demands we look after our veterans, but anyone in the forces today would look at what’s been done to these guys and see that for a lie. It’s wonderful to meet them, but absolutely horrifying to hear their stories first-hand.” Government minister Suella Braverman was among the Tory supporters. She said: “It’s really important to hear their stories of decades-long struggle and what their families have had to put up with. I think there would be a lot of support for this campaign and Parliamentary interest if we can get this heard.”  The MPs heard how Ministry of Defence documents showed Eric was exposed to 65 years’ worth of radiation in just 6 minutes while he flew through the mushroom cloud of Britain\u0027s biggest nuclear bomb in 1958. Scientists knowingly maximised his exposure, and were aware of the risk of genetic damage. Eric’s descendants have a 37% rate of birth defects and widow Shirley, 83, from Morden, south London, blames his later suicide on the effects of the radiation. Former navy cook Doug Hern, 81, and wife Sandie, 72 from Spalding, Lincs proudly showed them a photo of their daughter, and told how during two years of treatment for adrenal cancer she was photographed daily, but three hospitals now claim to have lost all records of her treatment. Studies have shown a third of the veterans were dead before 1999. Their wives report three times of the normal number of miscarriages, and their children show 10 times the usual rate of birth defects. Birmingham MP Jess Philips said: “I can’t think of any word to call it other than premeditated murder. It’s a total dereliction of duty on the part of the MoD and it shouldn’t be the responsibility of the veterans to prove the link. The link’s obvious.” Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry added: “The point is that nuclear veterans are recognised by other countries and it’s shameful that ours does not. The moment has come for them to be given justice. Stoke-on-Trent MP Ruth Smeeth said: “The veterans have had to wait much too long and we now need actions, not words.” Shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne added: “We must recognise the sacrifices they made for our country and right these wrongs. It’s time for the government to act.  Labour policy boss Jon Cruddas added: “A lot of people have felt the consequences of our nuclear tests and it’s absolutely brilliant the Mirror is making sure we don’t forget them. With 155,000 descendants of our nuclear veterans, there isn’t a constituency in the country that won’t be affected.” Tory grandee John Hayes, patron of the British Nuclear Test Veterans’ Association, said: “It’s a human tragedy that transcends party politics. Oldham MP Jim McMahon said: “When people step up to do their service for the nation it’s important that service is recognised. It’s a fantastic campaign by the Mirror.” Shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith vowed to put pressure on opposite number Gavin Williamson, who was conspicuously absent. She said: “It’s high time that our brave nuclear veterans were recognised with a medal. It’s a simple thing that the Defence Secretary can do very easily, without admitting liability. Former Treasury minister Liam Byrne said: “This is a matter of justice and duty and the government’s shameful treatment of some of our bravest veterans who put themselves right in the danger zone has got to be stopped, now.” Burnley’s Julie Cooper said: “I’ve been quite affected hearing about it. It’s such a small thing to do, the MoD can have no excuse for not giving a medal. There was also support from the House of Lords with Labour peers Baroness Alicia Kennedy and Lord Roy Kennedy, and cross-party peer Baroness Bryony Worthington signing the petition. Ealing MP Rupa Huq said: “It’s been eye-opening to learn what happened to these men. The public should hear and the government must listen.  Morden MP Siobhan McDonagh paid tribute to Mrs Denson, saying: “She has been relentless and determined and without thought for her own health. We must honour the nuclear veterans.” Maria Eagle said: “A medal seems to be the least we could do. It’s a scandal that for years the real suffering that’s resulted has not been recognised by the nation. Angela Eagle added: “It’s a really worthwhile campaign and the test veterans deserve recognition for the sacrifices they made. Brentford and Isleworth MP Ruth Cadbury said: “What’s really surprising is so many countries acknowledge responsibility and ours is the only one that doesn’t. The issues are not going away, in fact more children are being born with birth defects every day. Ilford\u0027s Mike Gapes said: “This has been a scandal for decades and the veterans have never had the recognition they deserve. We must rectify it urgently.” Tan Dhesi from Slough added: “I can’t understand why the government is the only one on Earth not to recognise the risks the nuclear veterans ran.  Chesterfield MP Toby Perkins, Sheffield’s Louise Haigh, Khalid Mahmood from Birmingham Perry Barr, Colleen Fletcher from Coventry, shadow health secretaries Paula Sherriff and Barbara Keeley, shadow veterans minister Gerald Jones, deputy speaker Rosie Winterton, Chris Elmore from Ogmore, shadow children’s minister Emma Lewell-Buck and Southampton’s Royston Smith were also joined by Tories Andrew Stephenson from Pendle, Banbury’s Victoria Prentis and Mark Menzies from Fylde. Mr Menzies said: “The least we can do is consider a medal for these veterans but in reality we need to do a hell of a lot more.

Charities hailed victory today as ministers agreed new protections for some of the country\u0027s most vulnerable benefit claimants. It comes after thousands of people lost their disability \u0027premiums\u0027 by moving to UC - the Tories\u0027 flagship all-in-one benefit. Premiums recognise the extra costs people face if they don\u0027t have a carer. But they do not exist under UC, which uses a separate system. Campaigners say that left some families \u0026pound147 a month out of pocket. Now Tory minister Esther McVey has halted any more Severe Disability Premium claimants moving to UC until transition cash is in place next year. This will protect 500,000 people who currently receive SDP.  And the Work and Pensions Secretary will make up the difference - including with back payments - for those who have already lost out. Government figures suggest 4,000 people are set to benefit from back payments - the number who lost SDP by moving to UC. Another 11,000 people lost the Enhanced Disability Premium, but were not covered by the new announcement. Mencap spokeswoman Beatrice Barleon welcomed the move after warning disabled people were falling into poverty. Child Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said: These are really welcome changes which will correct the current clear injustice.  But charities also condemned the government for only compensating the SDP group - saying help should go further and be permanent. Scope spokesman James Taylor said: These premiums are not a luxury – many disabled people rely on financial support for basic needs such as food, clothing and heating. “The loss of these crucial payments is disastrous for many disabled people. Mind spokeswoman VIcki Nash added: If the Government is really committed to supporting people with mental health problems to have control over their own lives, they must reintroduce these premiums for anyone making a claim to Universal Credit.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman loses five stone gets","story":"NewsWoman loses five stone and gets \u0027revenge body\u0027 after ex taunted her for gaining weight due to contraceptionAlexandra Quadrelli sculpted the \u0027ultimate revenge body\u0027 after being called fat by her ex, who she claims cheated on her multiple times\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJosh Saunders21:02, 7 JUN 2018Updated22:53, 7 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A woman who was told by a previous boyfriend she was overweight lost five stone in less than four months in desperate bid to keep her new man.  Alexandra Quadrelli sculpted the \u0027ultimate revenge body\u0027 after being called fat by her ex, who she claims cheated on her multiple times. The 29-year-old from Perth, Australia, was paranoid her partner would leave her when she bulged to 15st 6oz - about 98kg - after getting the contraceptive implant. Fearing her current partner would stop finding her attractive and battling depression because she hated her appearance, she started taking 123Diet Drops and a clean eating plan. In under four months the deli assistant, originally from Milan, Italy, shed a whopping five stone - more than 31kg - from sticking to the plan without exercising. Alexandra said: Before I felt bad, frustrated, ugly, unhappy and unhealthy. I constantly had the fear of going out and having a social life because I was scared others would judge me.  My life was constantly hiding my body under large clothing, I hid myself from everyone. I always loved going to the beach but when I was a heavier weight, I was too shy to wear a swimsuit or to go shopping because I was frustrated that there weren\u0027t suitable clothes for me. I was unhealthy, unhappy and I was so scared of losing my actual boyfriend because an ex-boyfriend was so rude to me, always cheated on me and would regularly tell me how fat I was.  So I told myself no, not this time. I started to take better care of myself because my health is more important and secondly, because I wanted my boyfriend look at me in different way. Now, I love my body, feel sexy and better about myself but more important than anything else, I\u0027m healthy. I love myself more and my boyfriend sees me in a whole new way. I will always be grateful to 123Diet.  Now I have a revenge body for all the people who are discriminated against their weight I have a revenge body for my ex-boyfriend who was humiliated because of my appearance and to show myself I can do anything. Alexandra says she never struggled with weight problems in the past, until having a contraceptive implant and the stresses of moving to Australia three years ago. This led her to hit her heaviest weight when she had a BMI of 34.9.

Charlie Bush was trying to impress a group of youths when he carried out the random attacks at a funfair during the Dartmouth Royal Regatta last August. The former Tottenham Hotspur triallist has two previous convictions for offences in which he used knives. He was on bail at the time for using a fake pistol to terrify a passer-by who he terrorised in the street. Bush was 14 at the time of the attacks but has since turned 15.  He had moved to Devon from London where he was involved in gang violence. In 2016 he posted a Youtube video in which he brandished a knife and threatened to stab rival gang members while burning one of their bandanas. The attacks at the regatta happened when he led a group of youths who knew him by his gang name of Charlie Little Man and approached three boys aged 15 to 17. One suffered a serious wound to his forearm as he tried to fend off the stabbing attack.  The others suffered a cut hand and a slashed cheek.  Bush, of Colley End Road, Paignton, admitted two counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, one of wounding, and one of using an imitation firearm to cause fear of violence. He was ordered to be held for four years and six months under a detention and training order with a one year extended licence by Judge David Evans at Exeter Crown Court. He said: These offences were committed to maintain and enhance you fearsome reputation. T That is a thread that runs through your offending history. Your street status is so important to you that you are willing to terrify or stab people. These stabbings were committed at a public festival in front of other people and friends of the victims. You were part of a large group, of which you appeared to be a leading figure.  This terrifying attack has left a legacy of physical wounds and psychological effects. They are worried in their teenaged years about going out and about.  Why should you create that fear and anxiety to other people just because you feel you want to be respected. I don\u0027t think you understand what the word respect truly means. Taking account your active role in gang violence and your proclivity to arm yourself with knives, it is clear you pose a risk of causing serious harm. Mr Nick Lewin, prosecuting, said at the time of the stabbings in Dartmouth, Bush was on bail for the gun offence in which he approached a man who was walking home with two women in Paignton. He followed the victim, pulled out the air pistol, cocked it, and fired it.  The victim had no idea it was not real until air, rather than a bullet, came out. Bush was with a large group of youths at Abbey Gardens in Dartmouth on the last night of the regatta when he attacked each of the victims separately. The first victim, 15, was stabbed on the palm as he tried to escape. He needed four stitches.  The second, also 15, saw the first stabbing and was slashed across the face as he ranaway. The final attack was on a 17-year-old who suffered a 8 centimetre wound which cut through muscle and needed an operation to repair with internal and external stitches. He spent two days in hospital. Mr Lewin said:All three victims have made impact statements saying how they have been affected in their studies and social lives. All three are fearful of the repercussions because of Charlie\u0027s reputation. All three have been left with physical and emotional scars. They were all very frightened.

Marine biology student Emily Stevenson, 21, and her father Rob, 50, have been cleaning beaches in Cornwall for ten years. Their community group, Beach , is made up of an army of dedicated volunteers but its task is getting tougher as the problem gets progressively worse. And after struggling to reach remote locations and remove bulky rubbish from Cornish beaches with their family car, they posted a request for help on social media.  Nissan stepped forward and loaned them a brand-new Navara off-roader AT32 pick-up truck - complete with snorkel - to help with the hardest of tasks. On Constantine Bay, where Poldark is filmed, the Navara pulled out rope and plastic nets which had been buried deep into the sand for more than two years. Remote rocky beaches were easily negotiated and the off-roader\u0027s snorkel allowed it to wade through deep water without the engine cutting out.  Nissan has highlighted the hard work of Beach  to mark Friday’s World Oceans Day 2018 and celebrate UK community heroes tackling beach plastic pollution. During its recent Great British Beach Clean Up, the Marine Conservation Society found 718 pieces of litter for every 100 metre stretch of UK beach surveyed.  Rob Stevenson said: “The beaches people visit, where they enjoy ice-creams and watch  their kids build sandcastles, are just one view of the issue.   “There are many more remote and unseen parts of the coastline that volunteers either struggle to reach, or need something to move larger items.  “Normally we’re using just our own family cars or DIY tools. Without help from Nissan and  the Navara Off-Roader AT32, we could never have released the old nets buried in the  sand dunes for years.”  More than eight million tonnes of plastic end up in the world’s oceans every year with devastating consequences for marine wildlife, fisheries and tourism.  Nissan is now inviting community groups across Europe to nominate remote and tough-to-reach beaches or other locations where the Navara could help them clear plastic waste. And it is also encouraging its European employees to use its own volunteering program, Days for Change, to join local beach cleaning projects where appropriate.  In the UK, members of the public or community groups who want to highlight an area of beach that needs clearing of plastic waste should use the free ‘What3Words’ photo app to send an image of the beach plastic they\u0027ve found along with its precise location to Nissan GB at beachclean@nissan   What3Words is unique global addressing platform that allocates every 3m x 3m location with a simple three word address, e.g. ocean.plastic.waste. This address corresponds to a GPS location, which allows a specific spot on a beach to be identified and easily shared - even along the most rugged and remote coastlines. Ken Ramirez, senior vice president, sales and marketing, Nissan Europe, said: “The Navara Off-Roader AT32 is the perfect partner for Beach .

We are visiting the mosque that sounded the alarm, and later became a Grenfell rescue centre, with Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour leader was there to share Iftar, the breaking of the fast, with survivors, bereaved family members and volunteers. A year ago, worshippers returning from Ramadan prayers just before 1am were among the first to see smoke rising from the tower block. Some rushed into the building, others began ringing residents and raising the alarm. By daybreak, hundreds of survivors and volunteers were crammed into the mosque. It was an extraordinary sight, its simple kindness in stark contrast with the horror of the tower still burning in the sky. “A year ago, this was a site of panic,” says Bellal el Guenuni, a regular at the mosque, whose wife, three children and unborn baby miraculously survived the fire.  “Families didn’t know where to go. People had no clothes on their back, they were homeless, they were scared. The people who helped them were Muslim young people from this mosque, defying the stereotypes.” The mosque became a refuge, then a store for mass donations and a community hub. It held a delayed Eid celebration for the surviving children of Grenfell, bouncy castles and candyfloss afloat in a sea of grief. It held funeral prayers for Grenfell’s victims over coffins shrouded in green cloth. It was where Princes William and Harry comforted survivors and the bereaved. Where Meghan Markle made secret visits. Women stranded in hotels with their families met to cook meals here. The Labour leader had come to pay his respects a year on to the \u0026shyvolunteers who never stinted, and the bereaved and survivors who found their comfort here.  “We are gathered in the shadow of Grenfell where we remember that the difference between us is not about religion – but between those who have everything and those who have very little at all,” Corbyn told an audience invited by Labour’s Community Organising Unit and the Labour Muslim Network, before helping serve the Iftar meal in the room next door. “This Kensington borough is a microcosm of our society… But when I first came here, and the tower was still alight, you were already providing care and sustenance, and you are still supporting people now with counselling. There is no individual hero of Grenfell. The community as a whole is the hero.” After the Iftar meal, Jeremy Corbyn met Bellal and also Adel Chaoui, who lost his cousin Farah Hamdan, her husband Omar Belkadi and their baby Leena in the fire. Their daughter Malak died later in hospital, leaving only one young child, Tamzin, alive.  Adel’s petition, backed by Stormzy, forced a Commons debate that led to extra inquiry panel members being appointed. “My family died and we are never going to get them back,” Adel told the Labour leader. “But what I want to make sure is that Tamzin isn’t campaigning in 30 years’ time like the children of Hillsborough. I will not accept that for her.” Bellal asked Corbyn why he thought the Government was still failing to make the UK’s tower blocks safe. “We will all be housed one day,” he said, “but the bigger thing is, are other families safe?” The Labour leader compared the families’ fight to the campaign against asbestos. “We fought to get it removed for years even when the Government knew it was dangerous,” he said.

Scots are claiming it\u0027s the worst year ever so far for the presence of the ravenous flies in the country. Scott Sweeney, from Inveraray, Argyll and Bute, works outdoors as a deer manager says the midges make it difficult to get any work done. The 31-year-old shared a shocking video clip of hundreds of tiny midges clinging to his hands and buzzing around him as he sat on a hill with his dog Leah. The post gathered more than 1,400 likes and was shared at least 1,200 times as Scots warned each other to be prepared when hitting the outdoors.  Scott said: I would say the midges are worse than ever this year. They maybe started later as the winter lingered on a bit, but now they have arrived they have just exploded the last few weeks. He added: They are always bad, but I don\u0027t think I have ever seen this before in my life. They may well calm off, but at this exact moment, they are the worst ever. They may have arrived a little bit later due to an unusually cold start this year, but midges are back with a boom and terrorising Scots. Lucy Fraser, from Rowardennan, Stirling, says she has become a prisoner in her own home and revealed that a contractor was forced to stop laying new decking at her property because the midges were so bad. Dr Alison Blackwell, from the Scottish Midge Forecast, backed the claims and said that despite the slowest start to the midge season in three years - midge spray has been flying off the shelves this week as they reemerge.  Midges typically begin to come out during the end of May, and in June the female biting midges arrive to kick off the season. In 2017 a record number of 68 million midges descended on Scotland - a 40% rise on the year before - but experts have not revealed this years\u0027 estimated figures yet. However, Scots across the country have taken to social media to share their midge misery. Lucy Fraser runs her home as guest house for walkers taking on the West Highland way and has to give them a stern warning not to open the windows - or suffer the consequences. The 57-year-old posted a photograph of midges infiltrating a lamp outside of her home. In the space of last week hundreds of the tiny critters filled up the glass case almost to the halfway point. The hotelier said: I insist the guests don\u0027t open the windows. If they do it\u0027s horrific and believe me some do and regret it. Each year from the end of May to October I become a prisoner and wouldn\u0027t dare go out the door before 10am and after 5pm. This is when the midge is at its worst, the sun keeps them away but the rain attracts them. I\u0027ve been here 22 years and it gets worse every year.  The mum-of-eight added: Trying to get tradesmen to work here between May and October is impossible as no one could work outdoors without being driven insane. I\u0027m trying to have a deck area built and the guys said they have never seen anything as bad and even though I gave them a huge fan they said they had to abort the job. I\u0027ve known these guys many years and they have done lots of work but just couldn\u0027t cope this year. They said it\u0027s first time ever he\u0027s had to leave a job due to midges. Social media users were quick to share their shock at the state of the midges already. Lynn Bindon said: A zombie apocalypse has nothing on Scotland\u0027s midge season. Stay safe people.

Experts from all over the world will form the Super Natural History team, carrying out DNA sampling of the waters.  Members will be drawing up a list of all life in the loch and making comparisons with other sites.  The study is being led by Professor Neil Gemmell, who said: Large fish like catfish and sturgeons have been suggested as possible explanations for the monster myth and we can very much test that idea and others. While the prospect of looking for evidence of the Loch Ness monster is the hook to this project, there is an extraordinary amount of new knowledge that we will gain from the work about organisms that inhabit Loch Ness - the UK\u0027s largest freshwater body.  Prof Gemmell, of the University of Otago, New Zealand, said he would be surprised if there\u0027s any evidence of DNA from a large extinct reptile - the so called Jurassic hypothesis. Professor Gemmell has assembled a team of global science leaders from the UK, Denmark, US, Australia and France, as well as Adrian Shine of the Loch Ness Project. The team is carrying out its investigation at the loch this month.  VisitScotland said the Nessie phenomenon is worth millions to the Scottish economy, with hundreds of thousands of visitors travelling to Loch Ness and Drumnadrochit every year to catch a glimpse of the mythical monster.

More than 10,000 gypsies and travellers are expected to attend the famous Appleby Horse Fair, arriving in style in traditional horse drawn carts on Tuesday. Two particular travellers caused long tailbacks with their unhurried mode of transport, leaving frustrated drivers in two mile long tailbacks. The two caravans moved along slowly towards the famous fair while more than 100 cars, lorries and vans built up behind them.  Members of the gypsy and traveller community have travelled from far and wide to attend the event, from all over the UK, Ireland and further afield. An additional 20,000 people are expected to attend for three days of trade, competition and festivities. More than 30 RSPCA officers have also been deployed to attend the fair, alongside fellow representatives from other equine charities.  Dating back to 1775, the event is an annual opportunity for travellers to showcase their horses and tell tales about life on the road. It became a major event in the 1900s when boxing and horse sales began to attract thousands. The event ballooned, becoming a key social event.  During the fair, the main road is closed to allow sellers to display their horses and each day horses are led to the River Eden to be washed and groomed. This ritual began in the 17th century as a way of making the horses more presentable for potential buyers at the pony market where breeds of all type are sold and traded.

Sally Holmes, 41, put a suitcase, some wall fans and a mini cooler on the pavement outside her house on Thursday afternoon.  Although she admits she didn\u0027t leave a note, she said she was doing it, as she has before, so someone passing by could make use of them rather than just throwing them away, reports the Nottingham Post .  Nottingham City Council, on the other hand, considers this fly-tipping and therefore \u0027illegal\u0027.  A Community Protection officer knocked on her door in the town of Bulwell, near Nottingham on Friday morning to tell her to bring it in and expect a \u0026pound75 fine to arrive in the post, which it now has. Miss Holmes said she is fuming about this and added: As soon as she came to the door I took them in. I disagree with it, once I took the stuff in she should have told me \u0027don\u0027t worry about it, but don\u0027t do it again\u0027. I have not fly-tipped, I have got stuff that is useful so people that have seen it can take it, it is recycling rather than just throwing it away. They are just trying to get money out of people. It\u0027s ridiculous and very stressful. She also argued that the items had been neatly piled outside the house, with the fans and cooler in a bin liner.  She understood that if she had tipped the contents of her green bin on the road it would be a different matter but this was not causing a problem. If she pays in 10 days the fine is reduced to \u0026pound50 but if she does not pay it at all she says she could end up in court and landed with a \u0026pound2,500 fine. However the council is tough on fly-tipping and said that people wanting to leave stuff outside for people passing by to pick up should instead take it to a charity shop or try their neighbours.

It was a big move for me.“Bobby Geddes (keeper coach) has been great and the gaffer has been brilliant because he’s put faith in me to put me on the bench and play me in the last game.“That’s the biggest thing for a goalkeeper, having the manager’s faith in you.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b17a8baa8716.jpg ","title":"dundee family gets together to honour special womans 106th birthday","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWhen you think of the year 1912 it seems like a completely different world.But in that year Ethel Lees was born in the small village of Newtyle – and just a few weeks ago, on May 23, she celebrated her 106th birthday with her large family.Ethel was raised in a two-bedroom flat in Lorimer Street, Dundee, and later in Roseangle House as one of eight girls and four boys in the Milne family.At the age of 23, Ethel married husband John at the registrar’s office which was located at the bottom of King Street.The couple had three children together Brian, Jack and Muriel.In 1963 the couple, together with son Brian, moved to Toronto, Canada, where daughter Muriel lived, and they were joined by son Jack two years later.Tragically the family were only there for four years before Ethel’s husband died at the age of 55.Ethel stayed in Canada with her daughter until 2013 when Muriel died following a lengthy illness.Although Ethel often visited Dundee she only moved back permanently to Broughty Ferry in February, where she now lives with son Brian.Although Ethel’s hearing is starting to deteriorate at the grand age of 106, she has had no major operations and her memory is second to none as she often reflects on her time playing field hockey as a goalie or her time spent travelling the world competing in Scottish Dancing competitions.She learned to drive while in Canada and only stopped when she was 92.Ethel said: “I have been very lucky to live this long and it is great to still keep in touch with my sister Ruby who will be 99 this year.“I have a great memory and could tell you stories and memories for days.”Her sons Brian and Jack said: “With a thousand stories and memories all the family wish this remarkable woman a very happy birthday and we hope she enjoyed her special day.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee man convicted of driving car with bald tyres and faulty handbrake","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA man who admitted a series of road traffic offences had sentence deferred for six months at Dundee Sheriff Court.Desmond Marr, 46, of Dochart Terrace, admitted that on July 12 last year, on Long Causeway, Perth, he drove a car with bald tyres.He also pleaded guilty to driving the vehicle while it had a faulty handbrake.Marr further admitted driving the car without holding a full driving licence and without insurance.Not guilty pleas to two charges, one of pretending to be another person, and the other of driving the car without an MOT, were accepted by the Crown.Sentence was deferred until December 5 for Marr to be of good behaviour.He was disqualified from driving in the interim by Sheriff John Rafferty.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee man told ex he would ensure intimate pics of her go viral","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA man who admitted sending abusive and threatening text messages to his ex-partner and her grandmother has been spared jail.Steven Tosh, 26, of Maitland Street, had sentence deferred last month, having previously admitted sending the messages to Amber Kenyon and Frances McVicar.Dundee Sheriff Court heard that Tosh and Ms Kenyon had been in a relationship since August 2017, but that had finished around the end of November last year.At 8.30pm on January 15, Ms Kenyon received a text from Tosh in which he implied she had started a relationship with another man.Another text read: “Always knew you for what you are.”In another, he implied he would let intimate photographs of Ms Kenyon “go viral” – although the court was told that in fact the images did not exist. Ms Kenyon, who was living with her grandmother at the time, subsequently blocked Tosh’s number.The court was told Ms McVicar received an abusive video message from Tosh on January 19, described as “rambling.”Both women were upset by this, and contacted police.The court heard the messages had been intended to be “a joke”, but Tosh “appreciated this was not how it came across”.He admitted that on various occasions between January 15 and 19, he sent grossly offensive text messages to Ms Kenyon which were indecent, obscene or menacing in character in that he repeatedly referred to her in offensive and abusive terms and threatened to expose intimate photographs of her.He further admitted that he sent text and video messages to Ms McVicar that were grossly offensive or indecent, obscene or menacing in character, shouted, swore and used offensive and abusive language.Sheriff John Rafferty said: “You have two recently analogous matters on your record in 2012 and 2013.“You have also breached bail opportunities on six occasions.

constantly people coming around the house, other people from the opera would all come around, drink some wine and sing some songs,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220It was mainly classical music that I was interested in when I was very very young.\u0026#8220If there was ever any children\u0026#8217s parts, me and my sister would get dressed up and thrown on stage, I sure to enjoy that.\u0026#8220There was never much singing involved, it was mostly just being children running around on stage.\u0026#8221Tristan said he started playing the cornet when he was four or five, and

the Betfred Cup group matches kick off there in as little as six weeks.The work being carried out will also improve drainage – something that has been a problem, particularly in the area near the

midfielder glen kamara amid transfer speculation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJose Mourinho was watching as Dundee’s Glen Kamara picked up his fourth international cap in Finland’s friendly defeat in Romania.The 22-year-old has drawn plenty of interest in his time at the Dark Blues – Mourinho, however, was only there as a guest of Romanian agent Ioan Becali and stressed in an ad-hoc TV interview he wasn’t looking at players, just enjoying his time off.Kamara, meanwhile, despite only joining up with the Finnish national squad on Monday, played the majority of the second half in Ploiesti.The Finns, ranked 62nd in the world and not at this year’s World Cup, started the friendly match well but fell behind in the first half to Cristean Manea’s 37th-minute strike.In the second period, Kamara made his entrance after 57 minutes for Nottingham Forest’s Thomas Lam but almost immediately the team fell further behind.On 61 minutes, winger Ciprian Deac finished from close range to give the Romanians a home victory.Finland boss Markku Kanerva said: “The start was challenging but we looked good. We fought well and did not give up.“Of course, we should not be satisfied with this result but we did not have a full squad.“At the end, we got a little bit to attack more.“I had to think a little about the team when Pyry Soiri and Glen Kamara were only involved on Monday for the first time so they only played the second period.“There was little to be done in the last third. Romania defended the centre very well and, of course, it is a good team.”Finland play Belarus in Kamara’s birthplace, Tampere, on Saturday.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b18fd352b753-e1528375962919.jpg ","title":"new 3g pitch means dundee sports club able to play football all year round","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA city sports club will be able to play football all year round after plans for a £600,000 3G pitch were approved.Fairfield Sports and Social Club hopes to no longer suffer from washouts after Dundee City Council bosses approved their application for a state-of-the-art pitch.The club falls victim to the winter conditions every season with teams of all ages left unable to play for months.Club trustee Jim Sorrie hopes those days will be behind them once the facility is up and running.He said: “Obviously it’s great news for us, as we were only just speaking about how long it seemed to have been taking.“This has been years in the planning and it’s going to make a major difference to us.“We’re bursting at the seams just now because we’ve got that many clubs here.“At the moment we’ve got the one main grass pitch at Fairfield Park and they’re all fighting for it.“That’s kids from the age of four all the way through to the senior team and we’ve got to keep it for them.“In the last few winters we’ve had clubs that weren’t able to play for three months because of the weather. This should mean an end to that now so it’s good news.”The club will put £300,000 towards the project which they hope will be matched by sportscotland now that the plans have been approved.The new pitch will lie to the west of the existing ground at Happyhillock Road and feature floodlights.Once up and running, people will be able to use the pitch between 9am and 9pm from Monday to Friday, 10am to 9pm on Saturdays and 10am to 6pm on Sundays.Mr Sorrie added: “This is going to stop some of our clubs having to travel to other parts of the city for games.“Most of them can’t really afford it.“This area is one of the most deprived in the country.“We don’t even charge sometimes and that’s the whole ethos of the club really.“These kind of facilities are what should be built across Scotland.“That’s where we’ll see the difference.“But we’re just glad we’ve got it because it’s taken long enough.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"promising signs as csaba laszlo begins to create new dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe summer of change at Tannadice has only just begun but the new-look Dundee United side is starting to take shape – what kind of shape are they in exactly, though?So far, the Tangerines have decimated last season’s pool with almost a full matchday squad list heading out the door.That left them with a skeleton squad before their business really got started last week.Five faces are in the door with the few players manager Csaba Laszlo wanted to keep given new contracts.More will be coming in during the next few weeks but, right now, how are they shaping up?GoalkeeperDeniz Mehmet looked certain to be the man between the sticks this season but for his knee injury picked up at the end of last season.With Harry Lewis heading back to Southampton after his loan, highly-rated youth keeper Josh Donaldson is the only fit goalie at the club.Verdict: A goalkeeper is certainly on the shopping list.DefenceTwo defenders have been brought in already this summer in Sam Wardrop and Callum Booth.Booth is expected to be first choice at left-back ahead of Jamie Robson while Wardrop will battle it out with Stewart Murdoch on the right.Though Murdoch has slotted in at centre-half, there is a big gap to be filled in that position.William Edjenguele, Tam Scobbie and Lewis Toshney are still around but Csaba and head scout Paul Sturrock are certainly looking for two starting centre-backs.Verdict: Big gap to fill in the middle but full-back positions look solid.MidfieldFit and healthy, Dundee United’s central midfield places are pretty much sewn up.Fraser Fyvie and Sam Stanton are the club’s stand-out talents at the moment and will occupy the middle of the park without doubt when available.In reserve is Scott Allardice after he signed a new one-year deal.Out wide, Fraser Aird has been brought in to play on the left side while Billy King is likely to start on the right.Paul McMullan hasn’t always been Csaba’s cup of tea but showed at the start of last season how effective he can be from the wings while youngster Matty Smith has slotted in out wide at times, though is nominally a striker.Verdict: Centre is strong when fit but numbers needed for a long season.AttackThe biggest capture so far by the Tangerines has been striker Nicky Clark coming from Dunfermline on a free transfer.The former Queen of the South and Rangers man has scored 29 goals in his last 62 matches in the Championship and is tasked with being Csaba’s main goal threat.Also in is former Ross County striker Craig Curran.The battling forward has never been prolific but his job will be to provide ammunition for Clark, while knocking in a few himself.James Keatings, too, is still around at Tannadice after a season beset by injury and personal problems. He’ll seem like a new signing if he can rediscover the form that helped Hamilton, Hearts and Hibs gain promotion to the top flight.Verdict: Looking good up top.Overall: With just 18 first-team players on the books, work is obviously still to be done but initial signs look promising. Adding solid defenders, however, is vital.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b192bd1b6fb8.jpg ","title":"sturgeon pledges 10m more for dundee va

raised about the gallery’s finances.Dundee-based Labour MSP Jenny Marra claimed that documents leaked to her revealed that museum bosses had applied to Swedish bank Handelsbanken for a £500,000 overdraft to cover costs.At First Minister’s Questions yesterday, Ms Marra asked Nicola Sturgeon, above, whether the government was tracking V\u0026ampA Dundee’s spending.She said: “It is my understanding that costs have been underestimated or missed and there is not a clear plan for where future revenue will come from to run the museum and service the loan after the initial opening phase.“Can the First Minister assure me today that her government is doing everything to ensure the V\u0026ampA in Dundee can be on a firm financial footing?”Ms Sturgeon said that, although not a government project, the SNP administration was a “big supporter” of the V\u0026ampA.She added: “The Scottish Government has provided £38m towards the construction of the V\u0026ampA.“We have also to date contributed £5.5m of revenue funding to support development costs.“I can also tell the chamber today that we have also agreed a further package of revenue support that will be worth £1m a year and will support the museum in its first 10 years of operation.“We are committed to supporting this fantastic new development for Dundee.”She added that the government would liaise with museum bosses and Dundee City Council to monitor spending.A spokesman for the V\u0026ampA Dundee insisted the bank overdraft was “normal practice for start-up organisations”, adding that the museum is in a “strong position” for its launch.He added: “We are very confident the museum will be an international success.”The museum will open its doors on Saturday September 15.It will feature permanent galleries of Scottish design, as well as an international programme of changing exhibitions showcasing design from around the world, new design commissions and fast-changing

“warm and caring” towards the people they worked with, and showed “very good knowledge” of their individual needs, preferences and choices.One informal recommendation was issued, reminding managers at the service to ensure medication records are signed and dated.However, no formal requirements were issued by the visiting inspectors.Joy Dunlop, managing director of Gowrie Care, said her team was

ideas such as the installation of a mezzanine floor and the creation of more open space could be the key to the transformation of Inverness\u0027 Victorian Market.Since taking up the role of market manager six months ago, Jo Murray has been exploring ways in which the historic site\u0027 future viability can be secured as well as meeting traders and other interested groups regularly.Suggestions, which have now been put forward, include extending opening hours, revamping shop fronts and hosting events as well as taking a radical look at the how the market hall section might be remodelled in a bid to attract local residents to shop at the historic landmark.\"The Victorian Market is very much loved by the local community but the local community doesn\u0026rsquot necessarily use it,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We need to encourage local customers to come in and shop.\"Under the action plan, a proposed programme of work is set be carried out in three phases.The first priority is to refurbish the stonework at the market\u0027 Academy Street entrance and replace the glass door.\"It is a really iconic entrance,\" Mrs Murray said.\"But I think it is recognised the smoked glass which has been installed is a bit of a visual barrier to the market. The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential. With the future of the British High Street in decline at the moment, we need to look at as many options to make it viable for all business and attract new brands into the city centre.\"Friday 8 Jun 2018 9:41 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04109000/04109721.jpg","title":"Casual attitude proves a winner for Fortrose cafe","story":"\u0026nbspA BLACK Isle cafe has been named Scotland\u0027 best choice for casual dining at the third Scottish Hospitality Awards.Fortrose Cafe won the north casual dining title at the awards ceremony at the Crowne Plaza Glasgow Hotel, before going on to beat the three other regional winners to the overall Scottish title.Owner Janet Gray admitted that even when she looked at the official winners photographs from the night, she found it hard to believe they had won both the local and Scottish titles.\"It came as a complete surprise,\" she said.\"The competition was really strong in the north finals.

We\u0026rsquove got the most roads and schools and most of them in the poorest condition.

It will also incorporate the North tower, which has been open to the public as a viewing platform for more than a year and Inverness Museum and Art Gallery.Locals and tourists can also look forward to new galleries which will host national and international exhibitions, displays celebrating the creativity and beauty of the Highlands as well as \"retail and catering\" which showcase the best of what the region has to offer.\u0026nbspA new hotel could also be created as part of the makeover.The project is to be part-funded by \u0026pound1.5 million from the \u0026pound15 million Scottish Government contribution to the Inverness-Highland City-Region Deal.The remainder will involve hefty borrowing by the council although it said it would benefit from the rents of the various businesses in the existing buildings.Speaking at the castle Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing, co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment, said the investment would support economic growth and create a \"sustainable, viable and must-see attraction to celebrate the spirit of the Highlands\".He added: \"It will create a once in a generation opportunity for future redevelopment for the city and the Highlands to create something of high architectural value \u0026ndash precisely the opposite of the existing buildings.\"Equally thrilled council leader Margaret Davidson said: \"This has been a long-held ambition.\"It will help us achieve our vision for this iconic site and Inverness Castle\u0027 place as part of a range of tourism assets this region has to offer.\"Highland planning director Stuart Black confirmed the purchase price was \"over \u0026pound5 million\", adding: \"We\u0026rsquore still in final discussions with the owner but it will be agreed by the end of June and then we\u0026rsquoll release the purchase price.\"He said the options for the site were to renovate, to redevelop partially \u0026ndash perhaps by removing the upper deck \u0026ndash or what he termed \"comprehensive redevelopment\".Project manager Graham Watson, of High Life Highland, said: \"It\u0027 a one-off opportunity for Inverness to really look at how it see its future for Castlehill.\"The attraction envisaged for the castle will promote the Highlands\u0027 \"creativity, wellbeing, culture, heritage and natural environment\".Friday 8 Jun 2018 9:41 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04043000/04043681.jpg","title":"Yellow peril told to look the other way","story":"\u0026nbspTRAFFIC wardens have been ordered not to slap fines on motorists in an Inverness\u0026nbspstreet \u0026ndash because the parking signs are invalid and council workers are too busy fixing potholes to find time to take them down.The \"yellow peril\" has been instructed to turn a blind eye on Greig Street until a maintenance team can get round to putting up correct signage.The move has left B\u0026ampB owners scratching their heads wondering how they can convince their guests to ignore the signs and assure them they will not get a ticket.\"Surely the council can do better than that,\" said Acer Glen Guest House owner Stephen Bowsher.\"I can quite believe they\u0026rsquore busy fixing potholes but are they really expecting me to turn around to a guest and say \u0026lsquoI know what the signs say but that\u0027 OK, you can just ignore it?

I am well aware of where I need to make changes and make improvements in the summer.”Forrester was placed on the transfer list at the end of the last campaign by Peterborough boss Steve Evans.The midfielder, who had a year left on his deal, was one of 14 players made available for transfer by the League One outfit.Aberdeen also enquired about Forrester’s Posh team-mate Jack Baldwin but have ended that interest.Bolstering the midfield is the main priority for McInnes this summer after that area was weakened at the end of the campaign.Anthony O’Connor is in talks with an English lower league club.His contract at Pittodrie expired at the end of May and he looks certain to move on. Loan midfielders Ryan Christie (Celtic), Greg Stewart (Birmingham), Dominic Ball (Rotherham) and Chidi Nwakali (Manchester City) have all returned to their parent clubs.Midfielder Greg Tansey, who still has two years left on his Dons deal, has been told he is free to find another club this summer.Tansey spent the second half of the recent season on loan at Ross County.McInnes insists that in Forrester he has landed a player who can feature in a number of midfield roles.He said: “Chris is a player who has always caught my eye.“He can play in a variety of positions.“He handles the ball extremely well and he will bring us flexibility in the midfield area.“We’ve been aware of him for a while and hopefully he sees Aberdeen as an opportunity to give impetus to his career. “I’m delighted to welcome him to the club.”McInnes has also targeted Hibs’ out-of-contract midfielder Dylan McGeouch.Aberdeen have offered McGeouch the opportunity to be the highest-paid player at Pittodrie.However, Hibs have also pitched in with a late offer in a bid to re-sign the midfielder who earned his debut Scotland cap during the recent friendlies in South America.Rangers have joined the race to land McGeouch.English championship sides QPR, Fulham, Blackburn and Brentford are also tracking him and can offer higher wages.Aberdeen have also targeted Ross County right-back Jason Naismith.The 23-year-old is a target for Burton Albion and Plymouth Argyle.Naismith has two years left on his contract with the relegated Staggies and would require a transfer fee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen road could be shut for six days as thousands of homes left without water1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThousands of properties were left without water today and roads and schools were closed after a water main burst.The problem, on West Tullos Road in Aberdeen, is affecting homes, businesses and schools in the AB11 and AB12 postcodes in Torry and Kincorth.The road – one of the city’s busiest – is expected to be closed until Wednesday evening as Scottish Water carries out repairs.A spokeswoman for the utility firm said: “Traffic management is in place while repairs are carried out and water has been re-routed through unaffected parts of our network to restore supplies to as many customers as possible.“We would like to apologise to those experiencing disruption and thank them for their patience while we work to restore normal service.”Around 4,500 properties were hit by the water outage and three schools – Abbotswell Primary, Walker Road Primary, and Torry Academy – were forced to close their doors to pupils.Mark Wylie, activities manager at the Jump In Trampoline Park on Craigshaw Road, said: “So far, we are okay because we have enough water in the tank, but we haven’t gotten an update in a while.“Scottish Water said the water would be back on by 9am, but it’s not.

£900 to purchase a Seabin for the town’s harbour.The piece of equipment costs £3,000 and can be submerged to collect waste 24 hours a day using a pump to suck rubbish from the sea surface.The idea came from warrant officer Grant Duthie, who saw the environmentally-friendly piece of equipment advertised online.Officers at the company are delighted with the amount raised so far.Warrant officer in the company section Ryan Clark said: “We wanted to do a fundraiser for something a bit different, hence the choice of the Seabin.“It was originally suggested through our president’s badge boys’ meeting by Grant Duthie, who also volunteers for the local lifeboat crew and it went from there.“It’s now a company section goal to raise the money through various fundraisers, such as coffee mornings, sponsored sports challenges and other events.“Originally, our plan was to raise the money over a couple of years, but with the speed that we’ve raised funds already, we hope to have it done in maybe over a year or so.”Once the Seabin is full it can be emptied and the contents recycled.It can catch everything floating in the water, including plastic bottles, paper and fuel.Fish are not caught because they do not get close enough to the surface to be pulled in.Clean water is then pumped back into the sea, helping to keep pollution levels down.The group, one of three Boys’ Brigade companies in the town, has already approached the harbour with the idea.Marc Thomson, officer in the company section, added that the efforts will count towards the boys’ badge

saved","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA charity has called for four historic north-east buildings to be saved.Conservation group SAVE Britain’s Heritage has branded the notable properties in Aberdeen, including Westburn House, as “vulnerable”.The group aims to champion decaying properties and publishes an annual Buildings at Risk catalogue – which this year also contains two buildings on Union Street and one close to the harbour.Liz Fuller, SAVE’s Building at Risk officer, said: “All over the country there are countless numbers of disused historic buildings which could be revived with new uses to ensure their survival.“In preparing this year’s buildings at risk catalogue, Revive and Survive, we have unearthed a treasure trove of beautiful buildings which tell the story of this country but need action to be taken if they are to survive.”Four out of the 100 buildings on the list mentioned are in Aberdeen, with Westburn House in Westburn Park featured.The property was built in the 1830s for David Chalmers, editor of the Aberdeen Journal, who commissioned Archibald Simpson to design it.The renowned architect created some of the Granite City’s most historic buildings.The property and park were acquired by the town council in 1901 and were used as changing and refreshment rooms for the nearby sports facilities, before becoming a nursery.It has also served as a health clinic.Peter Stephen, chairman of the Friends of Victoria and Westburn Park, said: “Because of the building’s status it cannot be dem-olished.“We have been trying for many years to get someone to come in and take it on.“And I think by now parts of the roof have fallen in and the area has been fenced off.“The building has a very, very, interesting history and we have thought it would have been great as a registry office, since the area would make a great wedding facility.”Mr Stephen said he was delighted SAVE Britain’s Heritage had taken note of the building adding he “would encourage someone to take on the house”.The Category A-listed building has been vacant since 1998 and its condition has gradually deteriorated.Councillors had approved plans by Elgin-based company Liberty Kids in 2016 to turn it into a modern nursery, but the lease recently fell through.The organisation has labelled the Victorian landmark’s condition as “very poor” and its risk as “high”.Councillor Tom Mason, who represents the Midstocket and Rosemount area, said: “It’s a classical building and I think if we can find a proper use for it, it can be restored to its former glory.“It would be good to attract the correct person to get the funding into place and get a champion who will restore Westburn House.“Anything in that direction would be absolutely fantastic.”Other properties featured are 156 Union Street which stands on the city’s main shopping street. It is described as being “made of granite and has three storeys with attic and cellars and a large shop window on to the street”.The report also features the building at 226-228 Union Street, classed as a commercial property and listed as Category C.Its ground and upper floors are currently for sale.Finally, it lists 2 Commerce Lane, which was built in the early 19th Century, was once a townhouse near the city’s harbour and has been “vacant for some time”.Liz said: “It has been vacant for some time and is in urgent need of repair, with both chimneys and the tops of the gables having previously been removed.“It stands in an area which has a variety of business and office accommodation as well as some residential properties.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mp expected to open snp conference in aberdeen today","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen MP is expected to open the SNP’s spring conference today.Aberdeen North MP Kirsty Blackman has been chosen to open the two-day event at the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre.More than 2,000 delegates were expected to attend with the announcement of the new deputy leader set to be announced today.The conference will close tomorrow afternoon with a keynote address from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.Delegates are also expected to hear from Deputy First Minister John Swinney, Westminster leader Ian Blackford and Brexit Minister Michael Russell.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"photographer who became oil worker to get inside view","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNavigating a career change can be one of the most difficult things that some people will ever undertake.Having worked freelance for 12 years, photographer Peter Iain Campbell decided in 2013 that he wanted to take on a project that was starkly different from anything he’d done before.“He wanted to live and work among offshore workers to document their experience and hopefully get enough shots to build a collection.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"three aberdeen schools reopen after burst water main forces closures","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThree Aberdeen schools that were forced to close due to a burst water main have reopened today.Torry Academy, Abbotswell Primary and Walker Road School were shut to staff and pupils following the incident on West Tullos Road yesterday.Scottish Water was called to deal with the burst water main, with residents in the AB11 postcode area possibly seeing issues with their water supply.Aberdeen City Council today said the schools have reopened following the incident.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/Murcar-Links-700px.jpg ","title":"all eyes on royal aberdeen for the 123rd amateur championship","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn international field of 288 elite men’s amateur golfers will descend on the North East of Scotland later this month all possessing one aim – to lift The Amateur Championship trophy and with it secure a spot in The 147th Open at Carnoustie in July.Golfers from 38 countries across Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa and the Americas will tee it up at Royal Aberdeen and Murcar Links when The 123rd Amateur Championship takes place there for the first time from 18-23 June 2018.England’s Harry Ellis won the title last year in dramatic fashion, battling back from four holes down with five to play in the 36-hole final at Royal St George’s.As a result of his victory, Ellis played in The Open at Royal Birkdale, took part in the 2018 Masters Tournament and will shortly head to Shinnecock Hills for this year’s US Open.That commitment will prevent Ellis from defending his Amateur title in Aberdeen but an impressive list boasting some of the best in the amateur game are ready to etch their name in history and grasp the career changing opportunities that go to the winner.One player who knows how valuable those opportunities are is 2002 champion Alejandro Larrazabal, who will be competing at Royal Aberdeen as a reinstated amateur.Norway’s Victor Hovland is the highest-ranked player in the field at 5th in the World Amateur Golf RankingTM (WAGRTM).

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

The Simmentals are hot on their heels with 103 entries, a 10-year record  and an increase from 85 in 2017. And the Charolais are also seeing a resurgence, with a jump to 76, from 61 last year.The numbers in the dairy section total 109 entries, with the largest class being the Ayrshire with 38, up from 29 in 2017. Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25. This year\u0026#8217s Queen\u0026#8217s Cup will be in the dairy class.Sheep entries once again command the Royal Highland Show with 2,029 animals making this the second largest number of entries in more than a decade.Leading the way is the Texel section with 182 entries, with the Beltex close behind with 177. Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries. Highland females lead the way with 94, with Shetland females closely behind with 84.In 2009 the show separated the Welsh C and Welsh D classes due to increasing demand, and that has proved to be winning formula with record entries again this year, with 43 and 59 respectively.Royal Highland Show Manager David Jackson, said: \u0026#8216The Highland continues to be the leading event for showcasing the very best the livestock industry has to offer, and it extremely rewarding that the industry continues to recognise its importance as a platform for the sector.\u0026#8216We continue to see very strong entries, with increasing numbers in many sections, especially in the commercial classes, and I know we will see some fierce competition for a winning place.\u0026#8216As an event, we grow year on year and attract new audiences as we widen the appeal for visitors from town and country. Yet we remain true to our roots as an agricultural show and work hard to be truly relevant to all aspects of farming and rural life.\u0026#8216The Grand Parade always proves to be a high point of the show and gives us a chance to celebrate the commitment and dedication of all our cattle and heavy horse exhibitors.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"springwatch spotlight on tarbert","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 07/06/18, 12:17 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert has featured on the popular BBC nature show Springwatch.An underwater segment stirred up a buzz on social media with its inside look at the colourful world just beneath the waves.Diver and cameraman Andy Jackson took to the bottom of Loch Fyne to view what he called ‘an underwater garden’ and the wonderful creatures within.The segment was aired on Tuesday June 5 and is available on BBC iPlayer for a limited period.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr uniteds ian mccall lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United\u0027s Ian McCall and Lawrence Shankland bag Ladbrokes awardsIt comes after Ayr United won the League One title, with an impressive 124 goals in all competitions.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet15:23, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland win the Ladbrokes League 1 Manager and Player of the Year awards (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland have bagged an awards double.

The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

Following a long battle with neuroblastoma, the 17-year-old died peacefully surrounded by dad Chris, mum Connie, and sister Olivia. It was a fight that captured not just the hearts and minds of Ayrshire, but the world beyond. Vanessa, who displayed courage which belied her condition, would rarely be seen without a smile on her face. For almost a decade, her name became synonymous with the fight against the aggressive cancer. Almost \u0026pound1million was raised with the aim of sending Vanessa abroad for life-saving treatment. That dream was realised and in January 2013, the family received the news they longed for – that the cancer was in remission.  Vanessa would return to school and rejoin classmates as a hugely popular figure at Marr College. Life, as normal as it could ever be, was good again for this inspirational girl. But the cancer would return and spread to Vanessa’s brain, with her family receiving the crushing news that her condition was terminal. As ever, Vanessa fought bravely until the last before she passed away just days short of her 18th birthday. Now her family are vowing that her fight will live on in her legacy. Dad Chris told the Post: “We are devastated at our loss.  “Vanessa was a huge inspiration to Connie, Olivia and I and so many more. “She achieved lots during her short but fulfilled life, she did everything she wanted to do and lived life to the full. “She never complained about anything, even though her situation was dire and she knew it. “We are privileged to have had such an inspirational and beautiful daughter.”  Vanessa’s funeral will take place on Friday, June 22 at 11.30am at Dreghorn Crematorium and then on to Troon Town Hall for a Celebration of Life. Chris added: “We’d like to ask that people wear bright colours and for the gents not to wear black ties. “That is what Vanessa would have wanted.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United. The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

The pair lost touch over the years but were reunited six years ago. Kim said: “We started chatting as friends but it became apparent the spark was definitely still there between us and a few months later we moved in together. “It was a whirlwind romance - within a year of meeting we had moved in together, got engaged and had a beautiful baby boy.  “We then had another baby in 2016 and it was then we decided to start planning the wedding.” The couple tied the knot at The Vu in Bathgate on Mother’s Day, March 11 this year. Kim said: “We were a bit panicky about the weather as the week before the wedding was storm Edna and everyone was snowed in. “There was still some snow lying around on the wedding day but the sun was shining. “The wedding day was an emotional day from start to finish it was full of tears and laughter and genuinely was the best day of our lives!” The bride wore a Maggie Sottero ‘Lisette’ dress from Opus Couture in West Kilbride, as well as veil and hair piece.

The 20-year-old from Prestwick, who is number one in the world for his tennis category, made it to the top of the 2867ft peak on Arran. Dominic was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, which is on the autism spectrum, at a young age and is part of the Great Britain Learning Disability tennis team. After three years in the sport, he is number one in the world for his doubles category and number three in the world for singles. He competes in the mainstream tennis ranks and is in the top 10 for the South/West Scotland overall. He is currently part of an apprenticeship at Prestwick Tennis Fitness Club and is close to achieving his level three coaching badges that would allow him to coach anywhere in the world. Dominic’s dad, Anthony, who runs the Iannotti Bros cash and carry, could not be more proud of him. The 50-year-old, from Prestwick, said: “Dominic was diagnosed at a young age. We tried all kinds of things but nothing seemed to help. “My wife went online and found children’s charity Bibic and we spoke to them. They were a godsend and they guided us and helped Dominic through a lot.    Since then we haven’t looked back and he has became a fantastic kid.  “You would never know he had this syndrome and that’s credit to the hard work done.” Dominic decided to give something back to the charities that have helped him over the years. He climbed Goat Fell with a group of friends and raised \u0026pound810 for Bibic and South Ayrshire Autistic Society. Anthony said: “We are very proud of him. “A lot of people now do fundraising for national charities but the local ones don’t get as much exposure or sponsors. We wanted to help Bibic as they were instrumental in helping the way Dominic is today and SAAS helped Dominic from a very young age.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"thousands pounds pocketed council after","story":"NewsThousands of pounds pocketed by council after secret VAT grabBut they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston14:18, 6 JUN 2018NewsCouncillor Peter Convery brands move on VAT “sleekit”\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of pounds is being pocketed by a council after a secret VAT grab. But they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure. In February HMRC announced there was to be no VAT on council provided leisure activities. And that will include swimming, gym use and bowling at Northfield. But South Ayrshire Council has not let any of its customers know. If effectively means golf charges have soared 24% on last year, rather than the 2.7% the council have boasted about. It means that golfers paying the \u0026pound429 season ticket price would be expecting a \u0026pound71.50 reduction for VAT.  Tory councillor Peter Convery is blasting the move as “sleekit.” And he said: “Surely people are entitled to get some money paid back to them? “This is about principle and this is sleekit. “This is peoples’ money and should never have been included in the original ticket charge. “It is very unfortunate the council cannot see this to any great extent.” In East Ayrshire, where leisure is provided by an arm’s length trust, VAT is necessary on charges. Details of the VAT grab emerged in an email between a golfer and Councillor Brian McGinley.  The golfer, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “I do not think the majority of season ticket holders will be enamoured to discover that a significant element of their season ticket fee is actually related to a cost that SAC no longer have to bear.” Ayr East councillor McGinley said in the email: “I have ascertained that VAT has been included within the price of a season ticket up until February 18 this year. “Following a court ruling against HMRC whereby sports services provided by local authorities are now classed as exempt for VAT purposes, VAT is no longer remitted to HMRC when income is received for season tickets etc.” A council spokesman would not explain why they had not revealed the VAT windfall, if players can expect a refund or whether is was just being used to mask a huge leap in prices.  He would only say: “We work hard to ensure our golf and leisure provision continues to offer great value for local people and visitors and this is reflected in our current charging structure. “The funding from entry fees and season tickets only makes a partial contribution to our overall operating costs – with the remainder coming directly from Council subsidy – and the 2.7% price increase on last year’s fees reflects the Consumer Price Index. “Reducing inequalities within our communities is a key commitment for the Council and we have extended the concessions available under the Access to Leisure card scheme – which includes a 15% discount for all South Ayrshire residents. The change in VAT application for Council leisure services contributes towards the costs of that important scheme, which will help improve health and wellbeing across South Ayrshire, as well as helping reduce the net deficit cost of running Council leisure services, which was almost \u0026pound11 million in 2016/17.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church help build new","story":"NewsTroon church to help build new school for hurricane victimsThe Troon church has raised £170,000 to help transform people’s lives in Haiti.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:28, 7 JUN 2018NewsPastor Richard Woods with Minister Rolex visiting Muirhead Primary (Image: Copyright unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Building a school for hurricane victims was once a dream for Seagate Church.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938.

As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message. Let people know what you\u0026rsquove seen and the emotions you\u0026rsquove felt.      \"Millions of children all over the world live in silence.\"    \u0027The Silent Child\u0027 screenwriter and star Rachel Shenton signed her #Oscars acceptance speech for Best Live Action Short Film. https://t.co/t3Dtf4Uy3c pic.twitter/PYB0M7gRNs"},{"url":null,"title":"IN PICS  East Lothian in the sun","story":"              THE sunshine has inspired East Lothian Courier Camera Club members to capture some stunning images this month.

Rockers Altered Sky are fulfilling their ambition of playing at Download Festival, Britain\u0026rsquos premier hard rock and heavy metal festival, on Thursday, June 7, with plans for a UK summer tour also set to be announced in the coming weeks.  The band, which includes Haddington\u0026rsquos Ana Nowosielska and Amy Blair, will be the main support in the Doghouse Tent, with the gig taking place the day before the main festival gets under way.  Ana, the band\u0026rsquos lead singer, was excited \u0026ldquobeyond words ahead of the festival, which is celebrating its 16th year.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is up there with a childhood dream.  \u0026ldquoYou would go to Download and see Slipknot and Metallica and we are going to be playing there as well.  \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely amazing.  The band is looking at hiring a van and staying for the four-day festival at Donington Park, which this year is headlined by Avenged Sevenfold, Guns N\u0026rsquo Roses and Ozzy Osbourne.  Ana added: \u0026ldquoDownload is definitely one of our goals.  \u0026ldquoIt is one of the biggest music festivals in the UK, especially for our type of music.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much suited to where we want to be.  Currently the band\u0026rsquos attention is focused on creating their second album, the follow-up to Without Wonderland.  The five-piece will soon head down to Wales to record the album, with a view to it being released in the New Year.  Ana, 28, said: \u0026ldquoEverything has been a lot easier this time.  \u0026ldquoWe were joking the other day and saying we had a good five years to write the first album and now we have had six months to write the second album.  \u0026ldquoThe difference is we are definitely going to see that the album is going to stand by itself.  The band are then hoping to get back on the open road, with a UK tour being organised and the band keen to venture further afield again.  Last autumn, the band enjoyed a 19-date tour which saw them performing in the Philippines and Japan.  Ana told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously talking about going back to Asia again. We met so many good people and made so many wonderful relationships.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to tour Europe \u0026ndash hit up Germany and we had an Italian tour in the works a year ago which fell through.  \u0026ldquoThen, of course, we would like to get over to the USA.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":null,"title":"LOOKING BACK  Remembering the first ever Haddington Festival","story":"              HADDINGTON Festival is celebrating its golden anniversary at the moment, with the event having put a smile on thousands of faces since 1968.

Afterwards, Kiptoo said: \u0026ldquoIt was really nice for me, the course was flat and good. I just ran how I felt as I was alone most of the time. Of course I would love to come back and defend my title next year.\"  Organisers of the festival this year teamed up with Project Africa to bring athletes who might not normally have the chance to take part in the event to Scotland.  The women\u0026rsquos race was dominated by Project Africa athlete Caroline Jepchirchir, who led from the front with a time of 2 hours, 47 minutes and 35 seconds.  This year the marathon took on a new route through Edinburgh city centre before heading out to East Lothian, then finishing at its normal place in Musselburgh.  Scottish-born Outlander star Sam Heughan completed the marathon as part of a double challenge to raise funds for Cahonas Scotland.  Sam said: \u0026ldquoMy second marathon within a month and another personal best. Thanks so much to the organisers and the volunteers for making this such a great experience to run.\"  Neil Kilgour, Edinburgh Marathon festival director, said: \"2018 has been another incredible year for the Edinburgh Marathon Festival with outstanding performances, tens of thousands of participants and millions raised for good causes.  \u0026ldquoWe are so proud to host a truly world-class running event in Scotland\u0026rsquos Capital for runners of all ages from across the globe. Congratulations to everyone who took part.

The second sculpture has been placed at the rear of Caponhall Court.  It has been designed to celebrate the industry which built the town, with a farmer and coal miner both carved out of stone.  Standing two metres high, the coal miner is depicted at the bottom, with the farmer gathering his crop above it.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.

East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.

Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.

There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.

Plain clothes police officers joined colleagues in uniform and members of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos community warden team at John Muir Park and Lochend Woods.  John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.  But in recent years there have been complaints regarding underage drinking, with about 200 people at the park\u0026rsquos Bullet Hill in 2016.  Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.  A council spokeswoman confirmed they had and would continue to work closely with police colleagues in \u0026ldquotackling anti-social behaviour in its many forms.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis can involve action being taken against the individuals responsible for the behaviour itself, alongside engagement with parents or s when appropriate.  \u0026ldquoOn the back of operations like the one at Bullet Hill, we also work with colleagues from other council departments to co-ordinate the clean-up of any affected areas so that members of the public can continue to enjoy our open spaces without debris from anti-social behaviour."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/4089089.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=180\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Residents call for change on recycling boxes","story":"              LOCAL residents have urged\u0026nbspEast Lothian Council to ditch recycling boxes for wheelie bins after the local authority produced a video about the\u0026nbsprecycling process.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times.

Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

They added that the flow is still very active and there is no way of knowing when the eruption will end or if more lava-spewing vents will open.  The fast-moving lava poured into low-lying coastal Hawaii neighbourhoods in just two days this week, destroying hundreds of homes.  \u0026ldquoLava continues to enter the ocean along a broad front in Kapoho Bay and the Vacationland area and it continues to creep north of what remains of Kapoho Beach Lots, said USGS geologist Janet Babb.  As the lava marched toward the bay, it vaporised Hawaii\u0026rsquos largest freshwater lake, which was hundreds of feet deep in some places.  The new land in Kapoho Bay is now owned by the state, but the peninsula will not look like the farmland that dominates that region of the Big Island anytime soon.  Depending on climate, rainfall and other variables, new vegetation could start growing soon, but it would take much longer for the fertile land and lush rainforests to build back up.  \u0026ldquoHow soon vegetation comes back on a lava flow really depends on the type of lava it is, and how much rainfall there is in the area, said Ms Babb.  \u0026ldquoThere are flows on the Kona side of the island that are much older than some flows on east Hawaii, they are much older but they have far less vegetation and that\u0026rsquos just a reflection of the difference in rainfall.  A small ohia tree was observed by a National Park Service employee during of a tour of a two-year-old inactive flow in Kalapana last week.  \u0026ldquoRainfall really makes a difference, said Hawaii Volcanoes National Park spokeswoman Jessica Ferracane. \u0026ldquoA lot of ferns will pop up first. So, it\u0026rsquos usually ohia and ferns that are the first pioneers of those new lava flows.  But the land is still highly unpredictable, and once the lava cools and hardens it will leave behind a jagged, scorched landscape with razor-sharp shards of volcanic rock.  Any new land masses that are formed by lava within the national park become federal land and any ocean entries outside the park becomes state land.  \u0026ldquoA lot of the ocean entries are extraordinarily unstable, Ms Ferracane said.  \u0026ldquoThe bench that was formed during 2016 and 2017 61G flow has already collapsed and fallen into the ocean, so nobody really owns that any longer.  The lava, which has covered more than 5,000 acres (2023.47 hectares) in this latest eruption is not only expansive, but very thick.  Scientists said that while the height of the lava is variable depending on the source and local topography, much of the area is covered in 10ft-20ft (3m-6m) of lava.  People who have private property in the affected areas will still own their land, though it will need to be reassessed once the lava stops flowing.  There are homes still standing in several subdivisions that have been inundated by lava, but many homeowners are unable to get back to those properties because the lava has already cut them off.  There are no homes left in the Vacationland subdivision and neighbouring Kapoho has only a few homes left standing. They too are cut off and inaccessible.  Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim said lava has destroyed more than 600 homes since early last month."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7895401.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Comedian Michael McIntyre admits it had been    touch and go    whether to perform","story":"              Comedian Michael McIntyre has thanked his \u0026ldquoamazingly supportive fans during his first show since being robbed by a gang of hammer-wielding thieves on mopeds.

Richard Hyman, who has analysed the retail sector for more than 30 years and predicted last year that 2018 would be \u0026ldquothe year of retail distress, said any retailer that did not \u0026ldquoexactly understand its core customer would not last in the current environment.  He attributed House of Fraser\u0026rsquos difficulties to a lack of investment, declining relevance with shoppers, a lack of brand differentiation and a failure to focus on the store\u0026rsquos core customer.  He said today\u0026rsquos announcement had been \u0026ldquoa long time coming, but reflected the \u0026ldquomost difficult retail market anyone has ever seen.  He noted that House of Fraser\u0026rsquos more successful rivals almost all had a strong private or own-brand label, which he described as \u0026ldquoenormously valuable for differentiating the brand.  He said: \u0026ldquoHouse of Fraser has developed lots of private labels but in a half-hearted way.  \u0026ldquoIn terms of its concessions, House of Fraser doesn\u0026rsquot have anything that nobody else has got. That\u0026rsquos why a private label is so important. House of Fraser has plenty but they\u0026rsquore all anonymous.  \u0026ldquoTheir [House of Fraser\u0026rsquos] sales productivity is very weak and that tells you that they\u0026rsquore just not a strong enough draw in an overcrowded market.  He added: \u0026ldquoThis is the most difficult retail market anyone has ever seen.  \u0026ldquoThe winning retailers have one thing in common and that is their relationship with their customers. If you don\u0026rsquot understand exactly who your customer is and build your brand accordingly, you won\u0026rsquot last.  \u0026ldquoThis really difficult market is going to be with us for years. Consumer spending is just not enough to support all the hungry mouths and there is no evidence of that changing.  Richard Lim, chief executive at analysts Retail Economics, said: \u0026ldquoDepartment stores are incredibly expensive to operate and the last few years have seen costs spiralling upwards from business rates, rents and the National Living Wage.  \u0026ldquoThe announcement to close such a significant number of stores highlights the unyielding shift towards online shopping and the overcapacity concerns faced by a significant proportion of the market."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6716198.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Man left two children screaming for help in searing hot car","story":"              A PRESTONPANS man left two children screaming for help in a searing hot car.  Andrew Yorkston parked his vehicle in a lay-by near to Drummohr Holiday Park and left the two youngsters in the back seat of the locked car for about 30 minutes on a hot summer\u0027s day.  The six-year-old girl and two-year-old boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl banging on the car windows and screaming: \u0026ldquoHelp, save us.  The worried passers-by contacted the police and waited by the car to calm the kids before Yorkston eventually appeared, claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been [away] five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 27-year-old then drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  On Tuesday, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Yorkston was in charge of the children when he was taking them to a nearby McDonald\u0027s and stopped off unexpectedly at the lay-by near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane told the court that the two-year-old boy and the six-year-old girl were spotted locked in the car at about 5.30pm.  Mr Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who were very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe six-year-old was shouting: \u0026lsquoHelp, save us.\u0026rsquo  The girl pointed to an opening in the trees and told the passers-by that the man looking after her was down there, the court heard.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, said that Yorkston, of North Grange Avenue, had stopped for a toilet break and his wife had been left \u0026ldquosuitably unimpressed by his actions.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  The solicitor added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0027s and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme.  \u0026ldquoFortunately there was no harm down to the children.  Sheriff Adrian Cottam deferred sentence to next month.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7806713.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"WHO admits mistaking Prestonpans for Preston on official pollution figures","story":"              THE World Health Organisation (WHO) has removed Prestonpans from its list of most polluted communities. . . after confirming that it had confused the East Lothian town with the English city of Preston!  There was widespread concern when the global monitor named Prestonpans as Scotland\u0026rsquos most polluted town in its latest breakdown of pollution figures earlier this month.  The annual list used readings taken from 2013 and named Prestonpans as the worst offender in Scotland.  WHO released a similar report two years ago which also named and shamed Prestonpans \u0026ndash yet it was thought then that the reported high pollution levels in the town related to the former Cockenzie Power Station, which had been operational until March 2013.  However, East Lothian Council told the Courier earlier this month that it believed the reading was actually down to a geographical error by WHO, claiming that the organisation had confused Prestonpans with Preston in Lancashire, nearly 200 miles away.  And this week, the WHO confirmed that this was indeed the case.  In an email to senior environmental health officials at the local authority, representatives of WHO confirmed that they had confused the two communities due to a computer mapping error.  They said: \u0026ldquoIt is true that there was a mislabel in the datum for Prestonpans, which should have been labelled as Preston.  \u0026ldquoThis error originated in the previous database release when reverse geocoding the coordinates from the EEA (European Economic Area).

Offering golfers the chance to improve their\u0026nbsphandicap whilst taking in the wonderful scenery, you\u0027re\u0026nbspspoiled for choice when choosing where to play. Taking out some of the hard work, here we bring five fantastic golf courses to try out this summer.  Balmore Golf Club  Balmore Golf Club, set in the secluded rolling countryside of East Dunbartonshire\u0026nbspbetween Milngavie and Bishopbriggs, is probably the finest inland Scottish golf course you have yet to play. Central Scotland is blessed with many great courses, but they don\u0027t come any better than Balmore. A bold claim, but the club\u0026nbspare confident that once you play the perfectly manicured 18 holes designed by six-time British Open Champion Harry Vardon, you will agree\u0026nbsp- and be happy to tell others the same.    Founded in 1907, Balmore Golf Club has a proud history, but it has an even brighter future. Significant investments in facilities for the whole family such as a 6-hole Par 3 course with complimentary child membership and an extensive practice facility for keen golfers eager to perfect their game has uniquely positioned the club. It\u0027s a safe, family-friendly environment successfully attracting a new generation of members such as former Celtic and Scotland football star Kris Commons who joined during April\u0027s new member intake:  \"I\u0026rsquove played a lot of great golf courses in Scotland over the years,\" said Kris. \"But I decided to join Balmore Golf Club for two main reasons: the quality of the course itself, plus the stand-out practice facilities which are set up to cater to families. The real clincher was the massive practice area which has two full size greens with bunkers, a six-hole par 3 course, putting green and driving range. My two boys are really keen on golf, so having such an impressive practice facility that they can use to learn and enjoy the game is important. If you haven\u0026rsquot played Balmore yet, then I strongly recommend you give it a try \u0026ndash you won\u0026rsquot be disappointed.    Visit soon to judge for yourself!

The club are proud to be one of the best rated golf courses in the West of Scotland.

The historic ruins of Buchanan Castle overlook the course and there are many references to the Graham family within the well-appointed clubhouse.  Rob Roy McGregor walked the estate in the past so visitors and members are truly walking in the footsteps of legends.

It\u0027s a joy to play and most of the time very quiet, allowing the visitor to relish the ups and downs of the fairways and the tussle with undulating greens. The arresting views across to the islands of Islay, Jura and Gigha provide a delightful backdrop on an idyllic summer\u0027s day with the firm Machrihanish turf underfoot, the majesty of the dunes and wheeling seabirds providing the musical sound track.  To provide a varied test for the competent golfer, the layout is not just a predictable nine out and nine back. The classic links holes, apart from the 1st, are the 5th, another par four with its fairway like an elephant\u0027s graveyard, the 10th, a clever dogleg par five and the 15th, a \"one shotter\" with real difficulty if the elusive green is missed from the tee. Members can also enjoy complimentary use of the practise and putting areas.    The course ranks highly on a global scale. Golf Digest rated Machrihanish among the top 100 courses in the world in 2018, climbing 30 places to now rank 61st in the world. The club is also rated fourth best value for money within the UK.

A poll of deputy heads and principal teachers found nearly two thirds either \u0026ldquodisagreed or \u0026ldquostrongly disagreed when asked whether they wanted to become a headteacher - up from some 50 per cent last year.  The Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland (AHDS), which conducted the survey, said the findings highlighted a \u0026ldquosignificant leaning towards uncertainty about seeking headship roles.  The same survey went on to highlight the main concerns of headteachers as being workload, bureaucracy and lack of teaching and support staff.  On average headteachers said they were working more than 55 hours a week - twenty more hours than they are contracted for.  Read more: Schools struggle to recruit headteachers  Members of the union who submitted written responses identified a range of concerns with one stating: \u0026ldquoI have the headship qualification, but do not want the stress of headship.  Another said: \u0026ldquoI cannot see how I could become a headteacher without it being detrimental to my own family life.  One headteacher who had been in the post for a decade said they had stepped down due to family circumstances citing a lack of work life balance.  The survey comes as the Scottish Government prepares to give more powers to headteachers under a new Education Bill.  Read more: Rushing Headteachers\u0027 Charter could be \u0027disastrous\u0027  The legislation will usher in a new Headteachers\u0026rsquo Charter which will enable heads to shape the curriculum, decide on how funding is allocated and select staff.  The rationale is a concern that decision-making by councils can be divorced from what is required at school level.  However, critics argue the proposals will increase school bureaucracy and make headteachers a lightening rod for any criticisms and concerns about standards making the job even more stressful.  Greg Dempster, general secretary of the AHDS, said international research proved how important high quality school leadership was.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat our survey tells us very clearly is that, due to a lack of resources or an excess of expectations, our school leaders are finding themselves diverted into front line roles or back-room bureaucracy.  \u0026ldquoThat prevents them from getting to the core of the leadership role of engaging with pupils, parents and staff in pursuit of school improvement.  \u0026ldquoThe current situation is putting many high quality candidates off headship, so the already poor recruitment position continues to worsen.  Mr Dempster said there were obvious implications for the introduction of the Headteachers\u0026rsquo Charter.  He added: \u0026ldquoSchool leaders are clearly struggling to deliver in their current roles and the government must take that reality seriously when considering how to progress and resource changes to the roles and responsibilities of school leaders.  Read more: Why Headteachers\u0027 Charter must be piloted first  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent body Connect, said members were increasingly highlighting concerns over the recruitment of heads.  She said: \u0026ldquoParent councils tell us they have been part of selection panels over two or more rounds of recruitment, with posts being re-advertised even in city schools where the pool of candidates should be bigger.  \u0026ldquoThe advent of the Headteacher\u0026rsquos Charter and the expectations this will place on headteachers is another factor.  \u0026ldquoWithout doubt school leaders are being expected to step up to a very demanding role which is critical in setting the right ethos and values in a school, for the good of children and their future."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/4157495.jpg?type=article-full","title":"First Minister has  no plans  to meet DUP leader during Scots Orange Order visit","story":"              First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she does not plan to meet Arlene Foster when the DUP leader attends an Orange Order parade in Fife later this month.

After weeks of internal negotiations and even suggestions of a threatened resignation from David Davis, Theresa May finally got agreement with her Cabinet\u0026rsquos leading Brexiteers.  This followed three separate early morning meetings in her Commons office with Mr Davis and his colleagues Boris Johnson and Liam Fox, which were described as \u0026ldquoconstructive. No 10 made clear none of them had threatened to resign.  Asked if the Prime Minister was confident Brussels would accept the \u0026ldquofudged back-stop plan, her deputy spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoI wouldn\u0026rsquot recognise that word but it\u0026rsquos important to say the EU put forward their proposal and we were clear\u0026hellipthat was unacceptable this is our counter-proposal. We look forward to discussing it further with the EU.  As the so-called Brexit War Cabinet later met in Downing Street, before Mrs May jetted off for the G7 summit in Canada, the Government published its technical note on its back-stop plan.  This is the time-limit, which Mr Davis had wanted inserted its omission in the draft had angered the Secretary of State, raising speculation he might quit.  A source close to the Secretary of State explained: \"The back-stop paper has been amended and now expresses, in much more detail, the time-limited nature of our proposal something the PM and David Davis have always been committed to.\"  However, political opponents seized on the key lines in the document, pointing out how it was not a guaranteed back-stop at all and it referred only to how the UK Government \u0026ldquoexpects the preferred customs option to be in place by December 2021 33 months from the start of Brexit in March 2019.  The Government believes it will never need the back-stop plan - the legal guarantee to maintain frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic \u0026ndash as it is confident of coming up with its preferred customs option post-Brexit.  The European Commission says both options are unworkable.  No 10 was unable to give any clear indication as to how the internal consideration of the two options was going or whether or not Mrs May and her colleagues were any nearer to choosing one or the other.  At Westminster, Labour\u0026rsquos Chris Leslie was dismissive, saying: \"After weeks of the Government negotiating with itself, the fudged document they have produced doesn\u0027t engage with any of the key Brexit dilemmas and is highly unlikely to lead to anything but more gridlock in the ongoing talks with the EU.\"  His party colleague Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, said Mrs May had \"signed up to a flawed proposal, which is inconsistent with her earlier commitments\".  He added: \u0026ldquoThe PM should urgently rethink her decision and back Labour\u0026rsquos call for a new comprehensive customs union and new deal with the single market after Brexit.  In Brussels, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u0027s Brexit co-ordinator, was downbeat.  Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, also took to social media to welcome the Government\u0026rsquos back-stop plan but said there were three questions: \u0026ldquoIs it a workable solution to avoid a hard border?

But now it appears that House of Fraser\u0026rsquos best days are behind it following an announcement that it is to close more than half of its stores, including its Edinburgh shop on Princes Street and its Oxford Street store in London, with the loss of 6,000 jobs UK-wide.  The chain said the planned closures are vital to secure the future of the brand, which began life in Glasgow in 1849.  And while House of Fraser has endured turbulent times in the past, experts say the threat of administration is still looming if the rescue plan does not succeed.  The chain is one of a number of former giants of the high street which have struggled to cope with changing consumer habits, the rise of the internet and the high cost of running \u0026ldquobricks and mortar stores.  The decision to shut stores comes as part of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) \u0026ndash a controversial insolvency procedure in vogue among struggling retailers. If the CVA is approved by landlords, it will affect up to 2,000 House of Fraser staff and a further 4,000 across brands and concessions.  The group said it also has plans to relocate its Baker Street head office and the Granite House office in Glasgow to help slash costs and \u0026ldquosecure House of Fraser\u0026rsquos future, although its flagship Buchanan Street shop will stay open.  Frank Slevin, chairman of House of Fraser, said: \u0026ldquoOur legacy store estate has created an unsustainable cost base, which without restructuring, presents an existential threat to the business.  \u0026ldquoSo whilst closing stores is a very difficult decision, especially given the length of relationship House of Fraser has with all its locations, there should be no doubt that it is absolutely necessary if we are to continue to trade and be competitive.  House of Fraser is one of the oldest chains in the UK, with a history stretching back almost 200 years to a single shop in Glasgow.  It began life when James Arthur and Hugh Fraser opened a drapery and haberdashery business on the corner of Buchanan Street which would eventually move into the lavish building which occupies the site today.  But it was under Hugh Fraser\u0026rsquos grandson, Hugh Fraser III, that the chain really took off. Inheriting the business at the age of 21, Hugh, later Lord Fraser of Allander, began expanding by buying regional store groups Arnott \u0026amp Co and Robert Simpson \u0026amp Sons.  On his death in 1966, his son, also called Hugh, continued growing the business beyond its humble roots, buying out more than 50 companies.  However, his time in charge came to an end in the 1970s when he was engulfed by an insider trading scandal, said to have been fuelled by his gambling addiction.  House of Fraser then passed through several hands, and now Hamleys owner, the Chinese firm C.banner, is being lined up to buy a 51 per cent stake in House of Fraser and invest \u0026pound70 million into what remains of the business.  But its cash injection is pledged only on the condition the retailer can agree the CVA restructuring.  Will Wright, a restructuring partner at KPMG, which is handling the CVA, warned of dire consequences if that does not go ahead.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business has been impacted by the mounting pressures facing the UK high street, with the declining profitability of certain stores exacerbated by costly legacy leases which were originally negotiated many years ago. With trading conditions unlikely to materially improve in the short term, the future of House of Fraser is at significant risk unless steps to restructure the business both financially and operationally are taken.  Leigh Sparks, Deputy Principal and Professor of Retail Studies at the Institute for Retail Studies, University of Stirling, said that House of Fraser was one of a number of chains struggling to stay relevant in the modern age.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere are other department stores which have gone by the wayside and it is a format which is not as popular with customers as it used to be.  \u0026ldquoMany of the products department stores sell can now be found in other shops on the high street for online for cheaper, and they are just not the draw they used to be.  \u0026ldquoThere are flagship department stores, such as Harrods and Selfridges, where the footfall is still enough to sustain them but House of Fraser is not in that bracket.  David Lonsdale, Director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, added: \u0026ldquoThis is further evidence of how the retail industry is going through a period of profound transformation driven by changes in shopping habits, weak growth in wages, and rising public policy induced costs. This is upending many retail business models, and that can be painful for the firms involved and for their staff.  \u0026ldquoThe industry is in the midst of a hugely challenging period and retailers are adapting and trying to reinvent themselves. What is clear is that the retail industry will look very different in the future. This will have implications for public policy, particularly for employment prospects in communities more reliant on retail jobs, for our town centres and for future revenues from taxes on property."},{"url":null,"title":"Happy birthday for Mackintosh with first glimpse of tea rooms restoration","story":"              FROM the moment you walk through the door, the touch of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest architect, designer and artist is everywhere.  Every high-backed chair is precisely lacquered, each window handle and umbrella stand a work of art in itself. On the tables, cucumber sandwiches, crisp white napkins and Willow-patterned cups and saucers hark back to a more elegant age. Welcome to afternoon tea Charles Rennie Mackintosh style.  Yesterday was the Glasgow-born artist\u0026rsquos 150th birthday and it marked a double celebration as guests including the city\u0026rsquos Lord Provost Eva Bolander were given a sneak preview of the stunning restoration and recreation of one of his greatest works.  Four years after an ambitious plan was created to bring the original Willow Tea Rooms Building in Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, back to its former glory, the scale and success of the project was revealed. Hundreds of craftspeople from as far afield as Chicago, Hong Kong, Cumbria and Kirkcaldy have worked to meticulously restore and recreate Mackintosh\u0026rsquos original vision. And it is magnificent.  Mackintosh at the Willow as it will be known (the Willow Tea Rooms name is owned by Anne Mulhern, who runs another cafe just yards away) won\u0026rsquot open to the public till 02 July. But it is worth the wait.  As well as a 200-seat tearoom and restaurant, a place to discover and rediscover the work of Mackintosh, there will be a visitor\u0026rsquos centre as well as exhibition, retail, conference and education space, creating a cultural and community hub. Elements of the site will open throughout the summer.  The Willow Tea Room Trust, which conceived and co-ordinated the \u0026pound10m renovation, hopes to welcome at least 360,000 visitors a year, providing a boost to tourism in a part of the city centre that has declined in recent years, not least after the recent fire on Sauchiehall Street.  Conceived as a a social enterprise, it already provides training and work for 40 staff, many of them young people involved in the Princes Trust charity. The Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society will also have a base at the site.  The original Willow Tea Rooms, opened in October 1903, was one of a series commissioned by Glasgow entrepreneur Miss Catherine Cranston, and the only one created by Mackintosh \u0026ndash her partner in design - in its entirety, from the architecture of the building to the furniture and cutlery. It also featured stunning panels by Mackintosh\u0026rsquos wife, the designer Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh and is recognised as one of the finest complete Art Nouveau schemes in the world.  The expert team behind the renovation project worked mainly from black and white photographs contained in an art periodical to get every aspect of the interior detail right. And the woman behind the transformation is delighted with the result.  \u0026ldquoThis is such a happy day, said Celia Sinclair, chair of the Trust. \u0026ldquoThis is a landmark heritage restoration and re-creation that is all about engaging the next generation of artists, designers and entrepreneurs. It\u0026rsquos also about instilling civic pride in Glasgow folk.  \u0026ldquoI hope Mackintosh and Miss Cranston would be pleased by what we have done, and I rather suspect they would love what we are trying to achieve.  \u0026ldquoMackintosh was neglected by his fellow Scots during his own time and I was amazed by the lack of interest when I originally approached various organisations over this project. But four years on this is an exciting new beginning. Toshie, your day has come.  Pamela Robertson, Professor Emerita of Mackintosh Studies at the University of Glasgow, a member of the expert panel who oversaw the renovation, described the day as a \u0026ldquomilestone in the history of the building.  She added: \u0026ldquoThis was a journey of discovery for all of us. The Willow was undoubtedly Mackintosh\u0026rsquos finest commission for Miss Cranston and has been extremely challenging for us to reinstate. But the analysis of the photographs has allowed us to re-engage with the textures and forms of this stunning design, to really see what Mackintosh envisioned."},{"url":null,"title":"  10m in revenue funding for V A Dundee from Scottish Government","story":"              The \u0026pound80m new V\u0026ampA museum in Dundee is to receive \u0026pound1m a year for ten years from the Scottish Government after it opens.  The First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said that the \u0026pound10m investment will be in addition to the \u0026pound38m the government has already given to the new building and museum on the city\u0027s waterfront.

A spokesman for the museum said that the Government made the pledge in January 2014, and Ms Sturgeon confirmed it in the Scottish Parliament after a question about the museum\u0027s finances by Jenny Marra, the Scottish Labour MSP.  Ms Marra referred to board documents that expressed concern over the museum\u0027s finances.  A V\u0026ampA Dundee spokesman said: \u0026ldquoEvery successful organisation plans for its finances, including assessing potential risks, and as part of that we have organised an overdraft as the museum prepares to open.  \"We have not borrowed money \u0026ndash this option would only be used for cashflow purposes, not to run the museum.\"  Ms Marra asked the Government to help the project, if it needed financial support, and urged it to keep a close track on its finances.  Ms Sturgeon said that the government had already given \u0026pound5m in cash to spend on revenue before its opening.  She added: \u0026ldquoI can also tell the chamber and I don\u0026rsquot believe, although I\u0026rsquoll be corrected if I\u0026rsquom wrong, that this in the public domain yet, but we have also agreed a further package of revenue support that will be worth \u0026pound1m a year and support the museum in the first 10 years of its operation.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government is committed to supporting this fantastic new development for Dundee.
