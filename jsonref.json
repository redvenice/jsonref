The hut is used by his family for holidays where he enjoys a great time sailing with his children and grandchildren. To own a hut you have to become a member of the management company for the site. John has received no complaints from neighbours about anything.\u0027 Land Registry records confirm that Labour\u0027s Shadow Chancellor and his wife paid £135,000 in cash in December 2013 for the two bedroom leasehold property in the popular holiday village of Potter Heigham. The average salary in Norfolk is £23,295 and the average first time property buyer price is £185,587. It is believed that the chalet is now worth around £170,000 as they have carried out improvements to it and prices in the area have soared by more than 18 per cent in the last five years according to property website Zoopla. But some villagers have been left less than impressed by McDonnell\u0027s revelation this week that Labour planned to target Britain\u0027s 2.7 million private landlords in its project to redistribute the nation\u0027s wealth. McDonnell said he wanted to offer private tenants the same right to buy their home for a bargain price as council tenants, meaning that landlords would lose out by being forced to sell for less than the market price. The controversial policy would not affect second home owners like McDonnell and his wife who do not rent out their additional property.  One near neighbour of McDonnell said: \u0027When I saw the news about him banging on about punishing people for being private landlords, I thought, \u0027Hang on a minute, he\u0027s a second home owner himself.\u0027 \u0027It seems a bit hypocritical and duplicitous for him to be targeting landlords when he and his wife have their own second home.        The chalet (pictured) is now believed to be worth around £170,000 as they have carried out improvements to it and prices in the area have soared by more than 18 per cent in the last five years according to property website Zoopla         The wooden property has its own jetty and a quayside on the banks of the River Thurne as well as a smart garden with a double swinging seat, a dining table and chairs, and a pergola with climbing roses         McDonnell (pictured with his wife) sparked outrage this week when he said Labour planned to target Britain\u0027s 2.7m private landlords in its project to redistribute the nation\u0027s wealth. He said he wanted to offer private tenants the same right to buy their home as council tenants, meaning that landlords would lose out by being forced to sell for less than the market priceSome of the policies he has been reported as coming up with are very, very Marxist. \u0027At least half the bungalows on the riverbanks here are rented out as holiday homes. McDonnell could probably make £350 a week in the winter and up to £700 a week in the summer if he rented his place out – but he does not do it. \u0027He and his wife just keep it for their families. They come up here quite regularly for weekends, especially in the summer.          One neighbour in the village of Potter Heigham accused socialist politician McDonnell of hypocrisy over plans to target second home owners when he owns one himself\u0027McDonnell\u0027s son finished university last year and came up with three or four friends for a week. They created bedlam, making a lot of noise and jumping in the river. They even bashed his boat into the staithe at Potter Heigham. \u0027I know one of the neighbours called McDonnell\u0027s wife to tell her what the hell was going on at their property \u0027I have seen him relaxing in the garden in full view of all the holidaymakers going past on their boats. Nobody seems to recognise him, but the people who have homes around here all know who he is. \u0027Members of his wife\u0027s family also stay here, and I have seen a guy who looks just like McDonnell. I am guessing he is his brother.\u0027  McDonnell\u0027s chalet cannot be accessed by car and is nearly half a mile walk away from the nearest car park on his side of the river. The neighbour who asked not to be named said McDonnell paid for an annual parking permit in a car park on the opposite side of the river. He added: \u0027When he is coming up here, he calls his handyman who runs a water taxi service. The handyman then takes his boat to the other side of the river to pick him up. \u0027If he wants to go somewhere when he is staying here, he can take his boat across to the other side, moor it up, and then go off in his car. \u0027I remember seeing him early in the morning, dressed in his suit and red tie as he rowed across the river to get to his car. Then a few hours later I saw him on TV on one of the political shows. \u0027The local handyman does a really good job of looking after their place. Last year I think he replaced all the wood on their jetty, their quay heading and their decking. It would probably have cost around £2,000.\u0027 The neighbour revealed that McDonnell sold his 17ft long Skipper 17 yacht with a cockpit big enough for four crew, for around £1,000 last year. He now has another similar sized, but slightly scruffy yacht, with an outboard engine and a mast which can be lowered to get under bridges. The yacht is moored at McDonnell\u0027s own jetty, just a short distance away from a small rowing boat with its own outboard engine on his quayside. A third rowing boat was seen lying upturned on the jetty today. McDonnell and his wife bought their property with 63 years remaining on its lease.          McDonnell has long standing links with Norfolk, having grown up in Great Yarmouth. His mother worked at British Home Stores in the town for 30 years, and his father was a branch secretary of the Transport and General Workers UnionThe freehold of the land is owned by the Environment Agency. In common with all other leaseholders in the area, they are shareholders in the Thurne Bungalow Management Company which manages their homes. Neighbours said that they had to pay a service charge of around £200 a year, entitling them to have their rubbish collected once a week by a rubbish collection boat.  McDonnell has long standing links with Norfolk, having grown up in Great Yarmouth.

Tim Jamieson is a disgraced cop en route to New York on the promise of work as a security guard. Running mainly on intuition – “great events turn on small hinges” – Tim surrenders his seat on the plane to a government official and begins hitching his way north instead, ending up in a nowhere town that exists mainly to serve its associated rail depot. Here he gets a job making night patrols and begins to gain the trust of the local sheriff.The town of DuPray will be familiar territory for King’s Constant Readers, as he calls us: a neighbourly place, small enough for everyone to know everyone’s business yet large enough for sinister interlopers to hide between the cracks. This is a setting King excels at creating – think Needful Things, think Bag of Bones even – and most readers will settle down for the ride, waiting for whatever curveball he is gearing up to throw them. What they will not be expecting is for Jamieson to vanish. There are almost 300 pages to wait before he is seen again, when DuPray – the town’s name is no accident – becomes the backdrop for the denouement of another story entirely.The bulk of the novel’s action takes place in the titular Institute, a top-secret facility run by shady operatives whose task is to protect humanity’s future by predicting vectors of conflict before they materialise. So far, so Philip K Dick. In a somewhat predictable twist, the Institute is using children to dispatch its targets: underage conscripts hand-picked from birth for their psychic powers and forced to become part of a process that leads inexorably to the decay and eventual death of their human selves.King is more than a little enamoured of the “special child” trope. The young hero of The Institute, Luke Ellis, is the latest in a long line ranging from Carrie White in King’s 1974 debut through Danny Torrance in The Shining and Charlie McGee in Firestarter all the way to Duddits in the once-read-best-forgotten Dreamcatcher from 2001. Closest cousins to Luke are Seth Garin and David Carver from King’s 1996 “mirror novels”, The Regulators and Desperation respectively. Seth is autistic and telepathic David believes he has raised a friend from the dead through the power of prayer. Luke embodies both powers.Like a substantial tranche of horror fiction, much of King’s output is concerned with the battle between good and evil. Where he departs from the template most substantially is in his repeating expositions on the nature of faith – not in God or a god necessarily, but in the imaginative and spiritual power of the god-shaped hole. When the Institute’s evil director insists that its work must continue no matter the cost in inidual lives, Jamieson counters that peace and freedom bought with the suffering of innocent children is no freedom at all. Dostoevsky King is not, but he clearly has no scruples about repurposing Ivan’s seminal argument with Alyosha in The Brothers Karamazov. As TS Eliot said, good writers borrow, great writers steal, and King is big enough and bold enough to steal from the best.It has often been argued that his paramount talent as a writer is for storytelling. Such a claim is borne out by his wider cultural influence, the Netflix series Stranger Things being just one recent example. What is mentioned less often is the engine of his storytelling, the compelling and tactile quality of the writing itself. His immaculate sense of place, his flawless ear for dialogue, that intangible literary quality we refer to as voice – these are the reasons we return to King, and in King it is the voice that persists, even when the stories themselves are so much bunkum.How far The Institute will satisfy you as a reader will depend on what draws you to King’s fiction in the first place. If you enjoy boss battles and grandiose conspiracies, the allure of cosmic forces moving beneath the surface of sleepy reality, then this novel may be for you. If, like me, what you enjoy most in King is his obsession with minor detail and irrelevant backstory, his gift for portraying the lives of ordinary people, his sly asides to the reader and loving literary references, you are likely to find this book – in spite of its 500 pages – too cursory, too interested in the wrong things. The Institute is already being billed as IT for the Trump age, but speaking as one who prefers those works often thought of as misfires (Hearts in Atlantis, From a Buick 8, even – yes – The Tommyknockers) it feels too writing-by-numbers for that, insufficiently distinctive. Extreme facility with words can be the writer’s enemy. One is never in doubt that King could write about anything. It is just a shame he writes so much of it, and – too frequently these days – to such small ends.• Nina Allan’s The Dollmaker is published by Riverrun.

Already I am petrified.This statue was a small token of appreciation for my many contributions, said the citation, which was read out by Aunt Vidala. She’d been assigned the task by our superiors, and was far from appreciative. I thanked her with as much modesty as I could summon, then pulled the rope that released the cloth drape shrouding me it billowed to the ground, and there I stood. We don’t do cheering here at Ardua Hall, but there was some discreet clapping. I inclined my head in a nod.My statue is larger than life, as statues tend to be, and shows me as younger, slimmer, and in better shape than I’ve been for some time. I am standing straight, shoulders back, my lips curved into a firm but benevolent smile. My eyes are fixed on some cosmic point of reference understood to represent my idealism, my unflinching commitment to duty, my determination to move forward despite all obstacles. Not that anything in the sky would be visible to my statue, placed as it is in a morose cluster of trees and shrubs beside the footpath running in front of Ardua Hall. We Aunts must not be too presumptuous, even in stone.Clutching my left hand is a girl of seven or eight, gazing up at me with trusting eyes. My right hand rests on the head of a woman crouched at my side, her hair veiled, her eyes upturned in an expression that could be read as either craven or grateful – one of our Handmaids – and behind me is one of my Pearl Girls, ready to set out on her missionary work. Hanging from a belt around my waist is my Taser. This weapon reminds me of my failings: had I been more effective, I would not have needed such an implement. The persuasion in my voice would have been enough.As a group of statuary it’s not a great success: too crowded. I would have preferred more emphasis on myself. But at least I look sane. It could well have been otherwise, as the elderly sculptress – a true believer since deceased – had a tendency to confer bulging eyes on her subjects as a sign of their pious fervour. Her bust of Aunt Helena looks rabid, that of Aunt Vidala is hyperthyroid, and that of Aunt Elizabeth appears ready to explode.At the unveiling the sculptress was nervous. Was her rendition of me sufficiently flattering? Did I approve of it? Would I be seen to approve? I toyed with the idea of frowning as the sheet came off, but thought better of it: I am not without compassion. “Very lifelike,” I said.That was nine years ago. Since then my statue has weathered: pigeons have decorated me, moss has sprouted in my damper crevices. Votaries have taken to leaving offerings at my feet: eggs for fertility, oranges to suggest the fullness of pregnancy, croissants to reference the moon. I ignore the breadstuffs – usually they have been rained on – but pocket the oranges. Oranges are so refreshing.I write these words in my private sanctum within the library of Ardua Hall – one of the few libraries remaining after the enthusiastic book-burnings that have been going on across our land. The corrupt and blood-smeared fingerprints of the past must be wiped away to create a clean space for the morally pure generation that is surely about to arrive. Such is the theory.But among these bloody fingerprints are those made by ourselves, and these can’t be wiped away so easily. Over the years I’ve buried a lot of bones now I’m inclined to dig them up again – if only for your edification, my unknown reader. If you are reading, this manuscript at least will have survived. Though perhaps I’m fantasizing: perhaps I will never have a reader. Perhaps I’ll only be talking to the wall, in more ways than one.That’s enough inscribing for today. My hand hurts, my back aches, and my nightly cup of hot milk awaits me. I’ll stash this screed in its hiding place, avoiding the surveillance cameras – I know where they are, having placed them myself. Despite such precautions, I’m aware of the risk I’m running: writing can be dangerous. What betrayals, and then what denunciations, might lie in store for me? There are several within Ardua Hall who would love to get their hands on these pages.Wait, I counsel them silently: it will get worse.You have asked me to tell you what it was like for me when I was growing up within Gilead. You say it will be helpful, and I do wish to be helpful. I imagine you expect nothing but horrors, but the reality is that many children were loved and cherished, in Gilead as elsewhere, and many adults were kind though fallible, in Gilead as elsewhere.I hope you will remember, too, that we all have some nostalgia for whatever kindness we have known as children, however bizarre the conditions of that childhood may seem to others. I agree with you that Gilead ought to fade away – there is too much of wrong in it, too much that is false, and too much that is surely contrary to what God intended – but you must permit me some space to mourn the good that will be lost.At our school, pink was for spring and summer, plum was for fall and winter, white was for special days: Sundays and celebrations. Arms covered, hair covered, skirts down to the knee before you were five and no more than two inches above the ankle after that, because the urges of men were terrible things and those urges needed to be curbed. The man eyes that were always roaming here and there like the eyes of tigers, those searchlight eyes, needed to be shielded from the alluring and indeed blinding power of us – of our shapely or skinny or fat legs, of our graceful or knobbly or sausage arms, of our peachy or blotchy skins, of our entwining curls of shining hair or our coarse unruly pelts or our straw-like wispy braids, it did not matter. Whatever our shapes and features, we were snares and enticements despite ourselves, we were the innocent and blameless causes that through our very nature could make men drunk with lust, so that they’d stagger and lurch and topple over the verge – The verge of what? we wondered. Was it like a cliff ? – and go plunging down in flames, like snowballs made of burning sulphur hurled by the angry hand of God. We were custodians of an invaluable treasure that existed, unseen, inside us we were precious flowers that had to be kept safely inside glass houses, or else we would be ambushed and our petals would be torn off and our treasure would be stolen and we would be ripped apart and trampled by the ravenous men who might lurk around any corner, out there in the wide sharp-edged sin-ridden world.That was the kind of thing runny-nosed Aunt Vidala would tell us at school while we were doing petit-point embroidery for handkerchiefs and footstools and framed pictures: flowers in a vase, fruit in a bowl were the favoured patterns. But Aunt Estée, the teacher we liked the best, would say Aunt Vidala was overdoing it and there was no point in frightening us out of our wits, since to instil such an aversion might have a negative influence on the happiness of our future married lives.“All men are not like that, girls,” she would say soothingly. “The better kind have superior characters. Some of them have decent self-restraint. And once you are married it will seem quite different to you, and not very fearsome at all.” Not that she would know anything about it, since the Aunts were not married they were not allowed to be. That was why they could have writing and books. “We and your fathers and mothers will choose your husbands wisely for you when the time comes,” Aunt Estée would say. “So you don’t need to be afraid. Just learn your lessons and trust your elders to do what is best, and everything will unfold as it should. I will pray for it.”But despite Aunt Estée’s dimples and friendly smile, it was Aunt Vidala’s version that prevailed. It turned up in my nightmares: the shattering of the glass house, then the rending and tearing and the trampling of hooves, with pink and white and plum fragments of myself scattered over the ground. I dreaded the thought of growing older – older enough for a wedding. I had no faith in the wise choices of the Aunts: I feared that I would end up married to a goat on fire.The pink, the white, and the plum dresses were the rule for special girls like us. Ordinary girls from Econofamilies wore the same thing all the time –those ugly multicoloured stripes and grey cloaks, like the clothes of their mothers. They did not even learn petit-point embroidery or crochet work, just plain sewing and the making of paper flowers and other such chores. They were not pre-chosen to be married to the very best men – to the Sons of Jacob and the other Commanders or their sons – not like us although they might get to be chosen once they were older if they were pretty enough.Nobody said that. You were not supposed to preen yourself on your good looks, it was not modest, or take any notice of the good looks of other people. Though we girls knew the truth: that it was better to be pretty than ugly. Even the Aunts paid more attention to the pretty ones. But if you were already pre-chosen, pretty didn’t matter so much.I didn’t have a squint like Huldah or a pinchy built-in frown like Shunammite, and I didn’t have barely-there eyebrows like Becka, but I was unfinished. I had a dough face, like the cookies my favourite Martha, Zilla, made for me as a treat, with raisin eyes and pumpkin-seed teeth. But though I was not especially pretty, I was very, very chosen. Doubly chosen: not only pre-chosen to marry a Commander but chosen in the first place by Tabitha, who was my mother.That is what Tabitha used to tell me: “I went for a walk in the forest,” she would say, “and then I came to an enchanted castle, and there were a lot of little girls locked inside, and none of them had any mothers, and they were under the spell of the wicked witches. I had a magic ring that unlocked the castle, but I could only rescue one little girl. So I looked at them all very carefully, and then, out of the whole crowd, I chose you!”“What happened to the others?” I would ask. “The other little girls?”“Different mothers rescued them,” she would say.“Did they have magic rings too?”“Of course, my darling. In order to be a mother, you need to have a magic ring.”“Where’s the magic ring?” I would ask. “Where is it now?”“It’s right here on my finger,” she would say, indicating the third finger of her left hand. The heart finger, she said it was. “But my ring had only one wish in it, and I used that one up on you. So now it’s an ordinary, everyday mother ring.”At this point I was allowed to try on the ring, which was gold, with three diamonds in it: a big one, and a smaller one on either side. It did look as if it might have been magic once.“Did you lift me up and carry me?” I would ask. “Out of the forest?” I knew the story off by heart, but I liked to hear it repeated.“No, my dearest, you were already too big for that. If I had carried you I would have coughed, and then the witches would have heard us.” I could see this was true: she did cough quite a lot. “So I took you by the hand, and we crept out of the castle so the witches wouldn’t hear us. We both said Shh, shh” – here she would hold her finger up to her lips, and I would hold my finger up too and say Shh, shh delightedly – “and then we had to run very fast through the forest, to get away from the wicked witches, because one of them had seen us going out the door. We ran, and then we hid in a hollow tree. It was very dangerous!”I did have a hazy memory of running through a forest with someone holding my hand. Had I hidden in a hollow tree? It seemed to me that I had hidden somewhere. So maybe it was true.“And then what happened?” I would ask.“And then I brought you to this beautiful house. Aren’t you happy here? You are so cherished, by all of us! Aren’t we both lucky that I chose you?”I would be nestled close to her, with her arm around me and my head against her thin body, through which I could feel her bumpy ribs. My ear would be pressed to her chest, and I could hear her heart hammering away inside her – faster and faster, it seemed to me, as she waited for me to say something. I knew my answer had power: I could make her smile, or not.What could I say but yes and yes? Yes, I was happy. Yes, I was lucky. Anyway it was true.They say I will always have the scar, but I’m almost better so yes, I think I’m strong enough to do this now. You’ve said that you’d like me to tell you how I got involved in this whole story, so I’ll try though it’s hard to know where to begin.I’ll start just before my birthday, or what I used to believe was my birthday. Neil and Melanie lied to me about that: they’d done it for the best of reasons and they’d meant really well, but when I first found out about it I was very angry at them. Keeping up my anger was difficult, though, because by that time they were dead. You can be angry at dead people, but you can never have a conversation about what they did or you can only have one side of it. And I felt guilty as well as angry, because they’d been murdered, and I believed then that their murder was my fault.I was supposed to be turning sixteen. What I was most looking forward to was getting my driver’s licence. I felt too old for a birthday party, though Melanie always got me a cake and ice cream and sang “Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer true,” an old song I’d loved as a child and was now finding embarrassing. I did get the cake, later – chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream, my favourites – but by then I couldn’t eat it. By that time Melanie was no longer there.That birthday was the day I discovered that I was a fraud. Or not a fraud, like a bad magician: a fake, like a fake antique. I was a forgery, done on purpose. I was so young at that moment – just a split second ago, it seems –but I’m not young anymore. How little time it takes to change a face: carve it like wood, harden it. No more of that wide-eyed daydream gazing I used to do. I’ve become sharper, more focused. I’ve become narrowed.Neil and Melanie were my parents they ran a store called The Clothes Hound. It was basically used clothing: Melanie called it “previously loved” because she said “used” meant “exploited.” The sign outside showed a smiling pink poodle in a fluffy skirt with a pink bow on its head, carrying a shopping bag. Underneath was a slogan in italics and quotation marks: “You’d Never Know!” That meant the used clothes were so good you’d never know they were used, but that wasn’t true at all because most of the clothes were crappy.Melanie said she’d inherited The Clothes Hound from her grandmother. She also said she knew the sign was old-fashioned, but people were familiar with it and it would be disrespectful to change it now.Our store was on Queen West, in a stretch of blocks that had once all been like that, said Melanie – textiles, buttons and trims, cheap linens, dollar stores. But now it was going upmarket: cafés with fair trade and organic were moving in, big-brand outlets, name boutiques. In response, Melanie hung a sign in the window: Wearable Art. But inside, the store was crowded with all kinds of clothes you would never call wearable art. There was one corner that was kind of designer, though anything really pricey wouldn’t be in The Clothes Hound in the first place. The rest was just everything. And all sorts of people came and went: young, old, looking for bargains or finds, or just looking. Or selling: even street people would try to get a few dollars for T-shirts they’d picked up at garage sales.Melanie worked on the main floor. She wore bright colours, like orange and hot pink, because she said they created a positive and energetic atmosphere, and anyway she was part gypsy at heart. She was always brisk and smiling, though on the lookout for shoplifting. After closing, she sorted and packed: this for charity, this for rags, this for Wearable Art. While doing the sorting she’d sing tunes from musicals – old ones from long ago. “Oh what a beautiful morning” was one of her favourites, and “When you walk through a storm.” I would get irritated by her singing I’m sorry about that now.Sometimes she’d get overwhelmed: there was too much fabric, it was like the ocean, waves of cloth coming in and threatening to drown her. Cashmere! Who was going to buy thirty-year-old cashmere? It didn’t improve with age, she would say – not like her.Neil had a beard that was going grey and wasn’t always trimmed, and he didn’t have much hair. He didn’t look like a businessman, but he handled what they called “the money end”: the invoices, the accounting, the taxes. He had his office on the second floor, up a flight of rubber-treaded stairs. He had a computer and a filing cabinet and a safe, but otherwise that room wasn’t much like an office: it was just as crowded and cluttered as the store because Neil liked to collect things. Wind-up music boxes, he had a number of those. Clocks, a lot of different clocks. Old adding machines that worked with a handle. Plastic toys that walked or hopped across the floor, such as bears and frogs and sets of false teeth. A slide projector for the kind of coloured slides that nobody had anymore. Cameras – he liked ancient cameras. Some of them could take better pictures than anything nowadays, he’d say. He had one whole shelf with nothing on it but cameras.One time he left the safe open and I looked inside. Instead of the wads of money I’d been expecting, there was nothing in it but a tiny metal-and-glass thing that I thought must be another toy, like the hopping false teeth. But I couldn’t see where to wind it up, and I was afraid to touch it because it was old.“Can I play with it?” I asked Neil.“Play with what?”“That toy in the safe.”“Not today,” he said, smiling. “Maybe when you’re older.” Then he shut the safe door, and I forgot about the strange little toy until it was time for me to remember it, and to understand what it was.Neil would try to repair the various items, though often he failed because he couldn’t find the parts. Then the things would just sit there, “collecting dust,” said Melanie. Neil hated throwing anything out.On the walls he had some old posters: LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS, from a long-ago war a woman in overalls flexing her biceps to show that women could make bombs – that was from the same olden-days war and a red-and-black one showing a man and a flag that Neil said was from Russia before it was Russia. Those had belonged to his great-grandfather, who’d lived in Winnipeg. I knew nothing about Winnipeg except that it was cold.I loved The Clothes Hound when I was little: it was like a cave full of treasures. I wasn’t supposed to be in Neil’s office by myself because I might “touch things,” and then I might break them. But I could play with the wind-up toys and the music boxes and the adding machines, under supervision. Not the cameras though, because they were too valuable, said Neil, and anyway there was no film in them, so what would be the point?We didn’t live over the store. Our house was a long distance away, in one of those residential neighbourhoods where there were some old bungalows and also some newer, bigger houses that had been built where the bungalows had been torn down. Our house was not a bungalow – it had a second floor, where the bedrooms were – but it was not a new house either. It was made of yellow brick, and it was very ordinary. There was nothing about it that would make you look at it twice. Thinking back, I’m guessing that was their idea.• © Margaret Atwood 2019.

There is no choice with Ducks, Newburyport, Lucy Ellmann’s 1,000-page plus novel, shortlisted on Tuesday for the 2019 Booker prize. A bewildering feat of simultaneous compression and expansion, it takes us into the mind of an Ohio housewife as her thoughts run wild – from the state of the nation to the minutiae of daily life. Its narrative occupies a mere eight sentences. Among many other things, it is a rebuke to the consistent downgrading of the “domestic” in literature, so frequently ascribed to female writers, because it insists that our consciousness does not exist in neat compartments marked personal, social, familial, political. Our heads, instead, are a riot.What does the inclusion of Ducks, Newburyport tell us about the judges’ tastes, judgments and priorities in assembling this year’s shortlist? Perhaps foremost, that they are unafraid of issuing a challenge to readers not to make assumptions about novels based on thumbnail sketches like the one above (Ducks is a hoot, as it were, not a slog.) That they are concerned with writers concerned with foregrounding women’s voices: joining Ellmann on the list are Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments, her reprise of the world of The Handmaid’s Tale Bernardine Evaristo’s Girl, Woman, Other, the story of 12 black British women, told in Evaristo’s trademark multi-vocal, poetic style and Elif Shafak’s 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World, whose title refers to the final moments of brain activity experienced by an Istanbul sex worker after a fatal assault.Completing the half dozen are Chigozie Obioma, whose second novel, An Orchestra of Minorities, brings him his second Booker shortlisting and Salman Rushdie’s Quichotte, which transplants the kernel of Cervantes’s Don Quixote into the world of a travelling salesman on a US road trip. In common with other novels on the shortlist (and indeed longlist: Lost Children Archive by Valeria Luiselli and John Lanchester’s The Wall spring to mind), Obioma and Rushdie’s books invoke older traditions and instances of storytelling and recast them in a contemporary world, bringing to the fore the experiences and pressures of movement and migration.Which of these six will triumph on 14 October?

Any number over 50 show rising activity, while a sub-50 reading implies falling activity.So, the news that the overall UK PMI lurched down to 49.7 is a worry, especially given the deterioration among factories and building companies.Here’s the details:Some snap reaction to today’s worrying PMI reports:Markit have also produced these charts, showing clearly how UK business activity has slowed in recent months and is now shrinking.Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, also believes the Brexit crisis is hurting the UK economy badly.Here’s his take on August’s PMI reports:“The services sector clung on by its fingertips this month remaining just above the no-change mark as domestic and export clients abandoned spending in favour of a wait and see approach and the political environment became increasingly murky.“There was also no respite from the increasingly lacklustre UK economy and sterling’s performance did little to help as service providers reported the fastest rising costs since January for salaries and fuel which they were then unable to pass on. As competition for dwindling orders stepped up, some firms resorted to cutting prices instead to tempt customers through the doors. “All these forces combined, was a blow to confidence, as future business expectations from service companies fell to July 2016 levels. There’s only so much companies can do to absorb costs before UK consumers notice the impact to their wallets, and only so much Brexit indecision the sector can take before it is tipped into contraction.” Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the UK economic outlook is darkening, as Brexit uncertainty ravages business confidence.He believes this week’s worrying PMI reports (based on interviews with purchasing managers across the UK) show Britain is sliding into recession:“Business activity in the service sector almost stalled in August as Brexit-related worries escalated, curbing spending by both businesses and consumers. So far this year the services economy has reported its worst performance since 2008, with worrying weakness seen across sectors such as transport, financial services, hotels and restaurants, and business-to-business services.“While the current downturn remains only mild overall, the summer’s malaise could intensify as we move into autumn. Companies have grown increasingly gloomy about the outlook due to the political situation and uncertainty surrounding Brexit, adding to downside risks in coming months. With the exception of the slump in sentiment after the 2016 referendum, August saw service sector firms at their gloomiest since the height of the global financial crisis in early 2009.“Overall jobs growth has meanwhile also ground to a halt as worries about deteriorating order books and the gloomier outlook took their toll on firms’ appetite to hire, pointing to a weakening labour market and adding to the darkening outlook.” NEWSFLASH: Britain’s private sector contracted last month, fuelling fears that the UK could be lurching into a Brexit-induced recession.Service sector companies, which make up the bulk of the economy, have reported that new business growth slowed sharply in August. Many blamed Brexit-related uncertainty, which led to subdued corporate spending.New exports stalled, despite the boost from the weak pound, as some European clients delayed spending decisions until there is more political uncertainty.This has hit business confidence too, which fell to its lowest level in three years (since the EU referendum in 2016).This is according to Markit, the data provider, whose Services Sector PMI has fallen to just 50.6 in August, down from 51.4 in July. That’s a bigger fall than expected, showing meagre growth.More to follow....Europe’s economy remains subdued, according to the latest healthcheck of eurozone companies.Data firm Markit’s latest composite PMI has risen to 51.9 from 51.5 in July. That shows weak growth, with a slump in factory production holding the economy back.Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: “The eurozone remained mired in a fragile state of weak and unbalanced growth in August. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, predict the pound could slump back towards $1.10 if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal.Berich adds that there are two scenarios under which sterling could crumble:Roberto Cobo Garcia, currency strategist at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, thinks the pound could keep rallying once No Deal is off the table:“The negative economic picture painted by the U.K. leading indicators should limit the pound upside potential ahead of the parliamentary session. “If the bill to block a no-deal Brexit is passed the pound could have more margin to appreciate.”Sterling has weakened steadily since, as Boris Johnson insisted Brexit would happen on October 31, deal or no deal.Investors are feeling more relaxed today, although not quite as relaxed as the Leader of the House of Commons last night....Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at investment platform Willis Owen, says people should still be cautious with their money while the Brexit crisis plays out....MPs have moved to draw a line in the sand over no Brexit, with legislation expected to be passed today which prevents the UK crashing out of Europe without a deal.“The pound has been the pressure valve for the UK markets taking most of the strain caused by Brexit uncertainty, and after yesterday’s fall it has steadied overnight post the vote in the Commons.Whilst a fall in the pound will boost the earnings of most FTSE 100 companies (with over 23rds of their earnings coming from overseas) in the short term the escalation of the issue is likely to weigh on both the pound and the stockmarket.”The pound is holding onto this morning’s gains, as the Labour Party confirm they will not give their approval for an early general election today.The opposition won’t provide the two-thirds majority needed until a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is off the table.Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says Labour could help to push the pound higher.... However, Mr. Johnson needs at least two-thirds of MPs to vote in favour of one, and so far, the Labour party doesn’t seem willing to take this risk. If the opposition party manages to get Brexit delayed in the outcome of no deal, we can see Sterling recover further from here.Shares in financial stocks, consumer-focused companies and miners are leading the London stock market higher.Over in Asia, stocks have surged after news broke that Hong Kong is withdrawing the controversial extradition bill that has sparked months of protests in the region.Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam will remove the draft legislation, government sources say, bowing to pressure from pro-democracy protestors.This move comes as the protests against the extradition bill have become increasingly violent, with scenes of police brutally attacking demonstrators.A government source said that Lam will emphasise that the removal of the bill was to streamline the legislative agenda, with the Legislative Council set to reopen in October after its summer break and hence it was a technical procedure.Lam had earliersuspended the bill, which would have allowed for the extradition of criminals to jurisdictions with which the city lacked a treaty, including the mainland, but critics have not been satisfied.It comes as fresh data suggests Hong Kong’s economy is on the brink of recession. The latest PMI survey shows that private sector activity slumped last month.City investors should skip lunch today and keep a firm eye on parliament.Boris Johnson will be facing MPs at his first Prime Minister’s Questions at noon, which could be a very bruising experience.He’ll be followed by chancellor Sajid Javid, who will outline the government’s spending plans for the next year. This Spending Review will be overshadowed by the Brexit crisis, but could help the Conservatives lay out some policies ahead of a snap election.The big action will come tonight, when MPs debate and vote on the bill to delay Brexit beyond 31 October if a deal hasn’t been agreed.Sterling is also rallying against the euro, clawing back all Tuesday’s losses.It’s up half a eurocent this morning at €1.105.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.A day is a long time in the markets, as Harold Wilson might have said had he swapped Westminster for the City.Just 24 hours after plunging below $1.20 to its lowest levels in three years, the pound has recovered all its losses. It’s the best-performing major currency so far today, sitting comfortably over $1.21 as London traders get to work.The sight of Boris Johnson suffering a humiliating defeat in the House of Commons last night is actually providing sterling with some support. MPs have taken control of Parliamentary business, and will vote today on whether to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.Having staged a recovery yesterday, sterling is up another half a cent this morning at $1.214.Investors have also noted that the government’s majority is in tatters, after 21 Conservative MPs dramatically rebelled, including several highly experienced former top ministers. They’ve been kicked out of the parliamentary party -- underlining that Johnson now lacks a parliamentary majority.Such a crisis would usually weaken a currency. But sterling is actually benefitting, as it bounces back from Tuesday’s slump.Johnson has insisted he won’t ask for a Brexit extension, and is instead pushing for an election. The opposition, though, won’t provide the two-thirds majority required unless tonight’s bill blocking No Deal has been passed.So it’ll be another huge day in parliament, with investors around the globe glued to the action.But after last night’s political drama, investors are now hoping that such an outcome can be avoided.Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group believes there could be more upside for the pound:It is worth keeping in mind that a snap election is a risky bet for Boris Johnson. If he loses, he will be the shortest serving PM in the country’s history, and more importantly, the Labour Party would opt for a second Brexit referendum to make sure this is what Brits really, really want.An election as early as next month could give another shake to the sterling, but even a tiny hope of preventing Johnson from crashing out of the EU without a deal could help the currency.A new healthcheck on Britain’s services sector is likely to show growth slowed last month. We already know that manufacturing and construction both shrank in August.Brexit will also be on the agenda when Bank of England governor Mark Carney and colleagues appear before the Treasury committee this afternoon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d53101ed9ec5244785b3fb06fa8a41301269b9b8/0_129_3430_2058/master/3430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd7887b199db5186f132f3435bfe8979","title":"which is the worlds vainest city","story":"Is it a plastic surgery centre such as Seoul or Rio de Janeiro, or a hotbed of selfie-takers such as Manhattan?With his penchant for posting topless photos of himself to his 181 million Instagram followers, Cristiano Ronaldo is pretty notorious for his vanity. (“Yes bro! Your body is ripped,” wrote one fan on a photo of the footballer meditating in the bath). “You used to see Ronaldo standing in front of the mirror loving himself,” said the former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson in an interview a couple of years ago. “But it was a nice vanity.”It is easy to find iniduals who are preoccupied with their looks, but hard to define exactly what makes a person vain. Factors such as economics, culture and age all influence how much we care about our appearance. Is there evidence that people in certain cities are more image-conscious than others?Looking at data for cosmetic surgery around the world is one place to start. The International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS) publishes data annually on the estimated number of plastic surgeons practising in each country, and the popularity of different procedures. Bearing that in mind, the top five countries for the number of total listed procedures in 2017 were the US, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Italy (the data for 2018 is still being compiled). So that could be an indication that the major cities in those countries are places where looks really matter.However, South Korea is thought to have the highest density of plastic surgeons in the world: 2,330 for a population of 51 million. Compare this to the US, which has roughly triple the surgeons in the ISAPS survey (6,800) but also has a population six times larger (327 million).Seoul’s swanky Gangnam District is the centre of this perfection-driven culture, with a reported 400-500 cosmetic surgery clinics in one square mile. The most common procedure is blepharoplasty, or “double eyelid” surgery, which creates an additional fold in the eyelids and makes eyes appear larger. Nose and jaw surgery is also popular.It wouldn’t necessarily be fair to attribute this to vanity, however, says the Seoul-based YouTuber Alfred “Haeppy” Lueng, who documents Seoul culture in his vlog. “South Korea is a very competitive society and many opportunities depend on looks,” he says. “It is required here to send a photograph with your CV, for example, whereas in other places that would be illegal.”Choi Min, a surgeon at Answer Plastic Surgery in Seoul who specialises in facial surgery, says: “If we lived in a world where looks weren’t important we would see very different movie stars and K-pop idols. For now, we live in this world and plastic surgery can even out the playing field.”Seoul’s ambitious young people see no reason not to have plastic surgery, says Leung: “There’s no shame attached to it and people are only making small changes – natural-looking beauty is still valued.” He adds that it is a misconception that Koreans are influenced by western beauty standards and are “trying to look more white” through face surgery. Rather, economic pressure and historical Korean beauty ideals around eyes and jawline drive the appeal, research shows.In Brazil, cosmetic surgery is similarly considered normal rather than a vanity project, and is common among all strata of society, says the anthropologist Alvaro Jarrin, author of The Biopolitics of Beauty. The government subsidises almost half a million plastic surgeries a year through public hospitals, according to Jarrin’s research, covering both reconstructive and purely aesthetic procedures.It is an urban phenomenon, Jarrin says. While Rio de Janeiro might be considered a prime spot for beach body-related anxiety, a density of clinics can be found in São Paulo too, as well as smaller cities such as Recife, Porto Alegre and Santos that are gaining traction as places for tourists in search of cosmetic surgery to visit.Jarrin says the availability of low-cost or free cosmetic procedures mean that people who can’t afford to go private can have done it poorly by junior doctors or have new techniques practised on them, leading to potentially serious mistakes. People take such risks because they are considered worth it – beauty can be a means to combat hardships.“The conclusion I have come to is that beauty condenses all the race, class and gender inequalities in Brazil – and it is a very, very unequal country,” Jarrin says. “People see inequality reinforced by beauty and constantly talk about having the right appearance to get a job, or marry up.”In the US, Los Angeles has long had a reputation as a city where looking beautiful and stylish carries the promise of really getting somewhere. However, Men’s Health magazine’s 2012 assessment of America’s vainest cities ranked another California city, San Francisco, much higher than LA, based on sales of products such as at-home teeth whitening kits and hair dye. Tampa, Florida, came top of that list, with LA a lowly 60th.Similarly, health clubs grew by 20 million members globally between 2017 and 2018, and the “wellness” industry is now a $4.2tn market. In the UK, a 2017 survey by a wellness brand found that Liverpool, Manchester and London were the top three “fittest cities” based on gym-going frequency. Meanwhile a US athletics brand found that the Bay Area in California, comprising San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland, was the most active metropolitan area in the US based on the number of available fitness options. The lengths people will go to preserve or alter their looks and figures are not the only indicator of vanity. The instinct to take photos of ourselves and put them on social media has caused much debate about narcissism in 21st-century culture. In 2014, Time magazine ranked the “selfiest cities in the world” by analysing over 400,000 Instagram posts with both a “selfie” tag and their locations tagged.Makati City and Pasig, part of the Manila metro area in the Philippines, topped the chart with 258 selfie-takers per 100,000 people. Manhattan was second with 202 tagged selfies while Tel Aviv, Manchester and Milan were also in the top 10. “While the metric of people who take selfies per capita is far from a perfect measure, it was far and away the most comprehensive means of comparing” the 459 world cities in the study, the author wrote. The metric could also indicate levels of tourism and the density of nightlife hotspots, however.Ultimately, it seems clear that vanity and the pursuit of beauty is universal. After all, according to the late Ivo Pitanguy, Brazil’s most renowned surgeon, looking good is something everyone is entitled to. As he once remarked, “the poor have the right to be beautiful too”.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de84cb630ee3c00984a040934ed132cab9455f0b/0_11_5238_3143/master/5238.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=914073708b749e833cc8eac2c5ce935a","title":"food banks and an early grave austerity britain","story":"According to the New York Times, Britain is far from a green and pleasant land of enviable public services. What happened to the country I’ve always been so proud of?Which image do you think best represents the state of modern Britain? If a recent article from the New York Times is anything to go by, it might well be the food bank. On Sunday, the NYT published a gloomy piece entitled Why British Life Expectancy Has Stalled, crowned with a big photograph of a food bank in Hartlepool. There is nothing green or pleasant about the country depicted in the story, which notes that “for the first time in modern history, Britons in some areas are living shorter lives” and dying more “deaths of despair”. It doesn’t mince words in identifying the reasons it points the finger at austerity.The fact that Britain has been broken by a devastating decade of government cuts isn’t exactly news. However, it is always instructive to see how you are viewed by outside eyes and it is sobering to observe just how grim the view of Britain from America has become. This country is more than just a laughing stock, it’s an object of abject pity.Looking at international coverage of Britain can also bring home the extent to which the Conservatives have hijacked the very soul of the country. In a 2018 article, for example, the NYT lamented, “For a nation with a storied history of public largess, the protracted campaign of budget-cutting … has delivered a monumental shift in British life.” I’m not sure you always appreciate that “storied history of public largess” when you live in the UK. Indeed, it was only when I moved to New York, almost a decade ago, that I understood how much I had taken Britain’s public services for granted. It wasn’t just institutions such as the NHS that I took for granted, it was the values behind them. The idea that being poor shouldn’t be a death sentence. The idea that museums should be free because culture is for everyone. Britain’s public services are what have made me most proud to be British. I have always smugly contrasted the values that underpin them with America’s rampant inidualism.The Britain I have always been proud of – my entire concept of “Britishness” – is vanishing now. Not just because of Brexit but because, as the NYT pointed out in its 2018 article on austerity, after years of budget cutting “Britain is looking less like the rest of Europe and more like the United States”. Politicians have spent the last decade privatising Britain and turning it into a smaller, grubbier version of America. With Boris Johnson in power, we even have our own pound-shop Trump.Perhaps most sobering about the NYT’s coverage of Austerity Britain (the paper has run a series on “Britain’s Big Squeeze”) is that a US paper is far more honest about the effects of government cuts than many of our politicians. As the United Nations poverty envoy (who happens to be Australian) noted last year, the Tory government is in a state of denial about the devastating impact of their policies. Indeed, earlier this year Amber Rudd responded to the UN’s damning report on austerity with more denial – calling it a “barely believable documentation of Britain” and saying, “The UK is one of the happiest places in the world to live.”Conservatives may be deluding themselves about the state of the country, but you only have to glance at international newspapers to see that they are not fooling anyone else."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4afbf906bfb0876084f9b0e6cae4c21e9846316/0_375_5632_3380/master/5632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ac2d15d46d88acb9b611a33302b239e","title":"left sunderland precarious invincibility working class people history","story":"I had a sick feeling that the stories of the working-class people I loved were slipping away so I set out to capture themI often wonder whether in order to see the whole shape of a place you must leave and feel the contours of its edges. To leave means you can return, but not as the same person. I grew up in Sunderland and left at 18, desperate to shed my skin and become someone different. At 24 I sat down to write my first novel and the raucous bars and rusty bridges of my hometown rushed out of me with a bright, hot urgency. Working-class lives are not often recorded in literary novels, so I wrote them down to remember. I had a seasick feeling that the stories of the people I loved were slipping away. I wrote them down to prove to myself I had a history.I wrote about Sunday afternoons at Seaburn Beach in the 90s, where I pushed hot coppers through silver slots at the amusement arcades and zipped up my Puffa jacket tightly. I put too much salt and vinegar on my chips and ate them looking at the sea. The waves crashed against Roker Pier like fireworks, spilling over the sides and flooding the footpath. My dad and I squinted into the spray and saw small figures running towards the lighthouse.“Wave dodgers.” My dad shook his head. He explained that teenagers played a game where they stood on the edge of the pier and tried to run to safety just before the waves hit. “It’s completely crackers,” he said. “Those waves are strong. Sometimes the kids get pulled under and their bodies wash up later on the beach.” We watched the water swell and churn. I felt the pull of it in my stomach.“Why do they do it, then?” I asked him.“Got nothing better to do, I suppose.”It was a delicate balance to portray the invincibility and precarity of Sunderland simultaneously. The people I know are inconceivably strong and capable, but their lives are not deemed worthy of investment by those in power, which makes them vulnerable, too.I wrote about Saturday nights down Holmeside in the late 2000s. My best friend and I toasted Ribena-coloured glasses of rosé wine, backcombed our hair with toothbrushes and threw peeling leather jackets over bodycon dresses. We linked arms through clouds of Silvikrin and scraped our heels across the pavement to Independent, our local indie club. Vodka shots cost 50p and we spun through smoke together. We danced all night to Foals and the Klaxons, holding hands in the smoking area as boys in eyeliner and red Libertines jackets asked us for a light. We grazed our knees on the sticky dance floor and lost our keys and phones without caring. We didn’t hold much power in the world and we knew it, but those dark, wild hours belonged to us.The protagonist of my novel moves to London for university. She feels inadequate because she doesn’t have the right words or books or clothes with which to move through the capital. When she returns home to visit Sunderland, she feels the sudden bruise of what she gave away.“I couldn’t compete with other people at university in terms of money or knowledge or intelligent witticisms,” she realises, “but the music and the dancing were absolutely mine.”After I moved away, I went back to visit and walked through Jacky Whites Market. I moved towards the fish stall where my gran used to work. It shone iridescent with memory. I watched the stranger behind the counter, her pink hands chopping and slicing and I looked at my own long fingers. My mam always says they remind her of my gran and I wondered whether I could really lay claim to that to the bleach-stung skin and knife-nicked cuticles of a woman who died before I was old enough to ask questions.When my novel was published, I signed copies of it at Sunderland Waterstones. I sat behind a stack of books, wondering if I really had a right to write about the city. After all, I had left it in search of something else and returned as a different person. I had allowed my accent to soften like wax. Perhaps it was all a mythical origin story, invented because I wanted to belong. But then people began to arrive. My great-auntie came first with her bleach-blonde hair, beaming with book in hand. My nan and grandad, in coats and jumpers, fussing over cups of tea. My primary schoolteachers. My cousins. My Auntie Marie and Uncle Jim.“I can’t believe it,” said Uncle Jim, wiping his eyes. “You’ve got it all spot on, love. That’s really how it was.” Suddenly we were a family and all of it was real. My life has taken a different shape, but our shared history is stacked tall inside of me. I still love going out dancing. I still feel the pull of the sea. We are from here, our stories matter, this one is mine and it belongs to me.• Saltwater, the debut novel by Jessica Andrews, is out now, published by Sceptre in hardback, audiobook and eBook"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5408cd0b3ca8b88ff00d3de7f4a018f2bb969acb/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82a79484ada0c2aa6065d9479bf217d5","title":"richard ayoade webchat","story":"The director, actor, author, presenter and overachiever is joining us for a webchat on 5 September at 12pm BSTIs there another actor who could deliver the line, “I came here to drink milk and kick ass, and I’ve just finished my milk” with as much deadpan aplomb as Richard Ayoade?Before he became a flipping household name as the painfully geeky Maurice Moss in The IT Crowd, the world has owed the actor, writer, director and flaneur a great debt.

A-listers will now be jostling for space in the hope that they, too, might receive that all-important awards boost.One of the most anticipated titles of the festival is fact-based drama Hustlers, which stars Jennifer Lopez, Constance Wu, Lizzo and Cardi B as strippers using their wiles to rob their wealthy clientele. The film, which is tracking for an impressive $26m opening weekend, is also getting early Oscar buzz for Lopez. “I think people forget that she’s such a gifted actor,” writer-director Lorene Scafaria said to Variety. “I was so excited that she was going to play a character on top of that. In a way, the role fits her like a glove, but it’s also a glove with spikes on it.”It’s one of many films at the festival directed by a woman, at odds with the lack of gender parity reflected in the lineup at Venice this year. Can You Ever Forgive Me? director Marielle Heller will also bring her latest film to Toronto, biographical drama A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, starring Tom Hanks as much-loved kids TV personality Mister Rogers. They will both be joined by Kasi Lemmons’ Harriet Tubman biopic starring Cynthia Erivo Persepolis director Marjane Satrapi’s Marie Curie biopic Radioactive with Rosamund Pike and Blackfish director Gabriela Cowperthwaite’s drama The Friend, starring Casey Affleck and Dakota Johnson.One of the festival’s most curious inclusions comes from New Zealand film-maker Taika Waititi, known for vampire comedy What We Do in the Shadows and more recently Thor: Ragnarok. His latest Jojo Rabbit is a second world war comedy, described as “an anti-hate satire” about a young boy who befriends an imaginary Adolf Hitler, played by Waititi himself.“Of course there’s a line,” Waititi said about potential controversy. “There’s always a line. But for me I think I find it naturally what would I feel embarrassed to show people? Then I wouldn’t put it in. If there’s any time I feel like something is inappropriate I pull back.” The film also stars Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson.Toronto will also be home to the world premiere of Brooklyn director John Crowley’s much-anticipated adaptation of Donna Tartt’s Pulitzer prize-winning novel The Goldfinch. It stars Ansel Elgort as a young man dealing with the death of his mother, who was killed in an explosion. Nicole Kidman, Sarah Paulson and Jeffrey Wright also star.The Last Jedi and Looper director Rian Johnson will be unveiling his starry whodunnit Knives Out, an Agatha Christie homage starring Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Lakeith Stanfield, Toni Colette and Christopher Plummer. “It all started with Daniel Craig, he was the first piece of the puzzle, kind of the central piece that clicked into place,” Johnson told the Observer. “Once we had him cast, suddenly we started making the movie, and so we are able to go out to all these amazing actors and say: hey, do you want to come out to Boston and have fun doing a murder mystery? We got very, very lucky.”After premiering his irreverent satire The Death of Stalin at the festival in 2017 to great acclaim, Armando Iannucci returns to Toronto this year with his Charles Dickens adaptation The Personal History of David Copperfield, starring Dev Patel in the central role. Iannucci has called it “a film about compassion, humour, generosity and friendship”. Other British films at the festival include Ordinary Love with Liam Neeson and Lesley Manville as a couple dealing with cancer, and Michael Winterbottom’s Greed starring Steve Coogan as a billionaire.The 10-day long festival arrives after both Venice and Telluride saw Oscar buzz growing for Renee Zellweger’s performance as Judy Garland in Judy, and Joaquin Phoenix’s take on the infamous DC villain in Joker. Both films will also play at Toronto."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f22429a1f608fdd060e0b6395d76c0d989b5ee18/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd313b3484c7369f91f6e7885a3c6de4","title":"which football team have completed the most passes in a match","story":"Plus: refs sharing names with teams they are officiating and more odd uses for football grounds“Any ideas on the most completed passes ever recorded in a football match?” asks Charlie Welton.Despite locking all our finest boffins into rooms tasked with watching every football match of the last 120 years to add up every pass, we could not get the answer. Instead we fired up the Stat-Signal and Opta mercifully saved us decades of work.Where better to start than at a Barcelona game, as ball-hogging has become a pastime for the Catalonians in the past two decades. Their short-passing heroics has brought them many wins, trophies and kudos, peaking at 988 completed passes in May 2011 against Levante. Inexplicably, they were only able to secure a 1-1 draw.Manchester City collectively tippy-tapped the ball around 942 times in their 5-0 pummelling of Swansea in April 2018. It was not their most successful day of passing, which happened just one month prior when they played Basel off the park in the Champions League in a 2-1 home defeat to the Swiss side, wasting 979 passes in the process. Luckily for City, they had hammered them in the first leg.The only side to pass the 1,000 mark are Bayern Munich, who made Hertha Berlin very dizzy for 90 minutes in March 2014, in a win that secured the Bundesliga title ridiculously early and one in which Philip Lahm produced his perfect 134 from 134:These games have something a certain Mr Josep Guardiola in common. No small feat for the Catalan who now has something else to add to his CV, along with a few shiny trinkets.Guardiola, however, cannot take credit for all the inidual performance passing art. At the top of the tree, where no doubt he could still pick out a 50-yard through-ball, is Julian Weigl. The Borussia Dortmund midfielder successfully found a teammate on no fewer than 199 occasions when playing FC Köln in 2016. Although he must be disappointed not to get the double ton up.And when it comes to the international game, Spain – spot the thread – have the men’s World Cup best (recorded since 1966) against hosts Russia in 2018, smashing Argentina’s 703 completed passes against Greece in 2010. Death by 779 cuts it was not, with Russia winning on penalties after a 1-1 draw. Sergio Ramos was only 21 shy of Russia’s 162 completed passes on his own.“The referee for the Cambridge United v Oldham Athletic game was none other than a Mr Scott Oldham,” writes Aron Royle. “No suggestion of bias of course, but are there any other examples of referees sharing their name with one of the teams they are officiating?”Will Bains leaps right in. “Adam Bromley has refereed a total of seven matches involving Bromley that I can find, resulting in three wins, two draws and two defeats for the team from Kent,” he mails. “Elsewhere in the National League, there is a single instance of Simon Barrow refereeing the team with whom he shares a name: a 2-0 victory away at Eastleigh.”Needless to say, there were absolutely loads more strange uses for stadia …Kieron Parr offers: “In 1992, Wembley hosted the World Wrestling Federation’s Summerslam. This featured The British Bulldog vs Bret ‘The Hitman’ Hart in the main event.” Indeed, the result even made the Daily Mail’s classified sports results the next morning. Marcos Garcia brings our attention to filming at now-mid-table Premier League grounds. First, The Fall taking over Turf Moor. And Snatch Of The Day, which explained how not to get pickpocketed.Eddy Reynolds chimes in. “The 2011 Eurovision Song Contest was held in Fortuna Düsseldorf’s Esprit Arena, requiring six weeks to convert it,” he explains. The UK were represented by Blue, who secured 100 points for their song ‘I Can’, meaning an 11th-placed finish, one spot above Moldova. Azerbaijan were worthy winners.Alex Jackson from the National Football Museum tries to lift the tone: “Bloomfield Road was used to host part of the Victory Celebration of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners’ Federation on 21 June 1919. An estimated 100,000 men, women and children travelled in over 130 special trains. They assembled on the promenade, before many marched to the stadium for an open air-meeting. Several speeches by MPs and union leaders hoped that the Royal Commission report on the coal industry would recommend nationalisation, something that sadly did not happen until 1947.”Finally, we enjoyed this from Nicholas Walton, who writes that “back in 2007 the Stadion Grbavica, home to mighty FC Zeljeznicar of Sarajevo, hosted the British Embassy’s cricket tournament, which had hitherto been suspended for several years. As BBC correspondent on the ground, I was captain and wicketkeeper for the mightily-outclassed journalists’ team. We had maybe five or six players, from Britain, the US, Bosnia, Netherlands and beyond, and were rubbish. I have no idea how the Embassy managed to get the ramshackle tournament held in the 13,000-seat stadium.”Back in 2008, Michael McCarthy posed this sartorial head-scratcher: “Tranmere Rovers have had the same shirt sponsor since 1989. Are there any teams who have had theirs longer?”In response, Timothy Casson, Chris Clough and Steve Wilson all pointed to PSV Eindhoven, a club that began life as a works team for Philips. The brand name has adorned their shirts since 1982, when Dutch football first allowed top-flight shirt sponsorship, and it is unlikely to be taken off as long as the electrical-peddler remains in charge.Paul Haynes highlights a similar set-up at Bayer Leverkusen whose badge – “the Bayer cross” – is the emblem of pharmaceutical company Friedrich Bayer and has adorned the club’s shirt since 1904 but, crucially, not at the expense of other sponsors names. And Richard Henriksson writes in from Sweden with a potential winner. While IFK Gothenburg have had ICA – a Swedish grocery store – on their shirts since 1982 (the same as PSV), they began sporting ICA on their shorts in 1976.• For more from the font of nerdvana, click this thing here.“Hereford FC from the National League North (sixth tier) have recently postponed two fixtures due to international call-ups,” reports Eddy Reynolds. “Is this the lowest level for this to happen?”“All three penalties that Sebastián Coates conceded for Sporting against Rio Ave were fouls on the same player, Mehdi Taremi,” writes Alexandre Queirós. “Is there any other example of the same player fouling the same opponent and conceding a penalty on three occasions in the same match?”Email your questions and answers to knowledge@the or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1371f79b27f8b078dfc40d360fd5acfa4bf5251/79_59_2076_1246/master/2076.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1317f13d9c76c6be24a0fb506e8be08","title":"tony hawks pro skater playstation games skateboarding","story":"Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater appeared on PlayStation 20 years ago this week – and transformed sports sims for ever. Hawk and the game’s developers assess the impact of the 100m-selling seriesWhen Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater was released 20 years ago this week, initial projections for the game were modest. Although Sega’s Top Skater had been a hit in the arcades two years before, and there had been a couple of early hits such as 720 and Skate or Die, the idea of an in-depth skating sim was untested. Activision aimed to ship 250,000 copies and developer Neversoft just hoped there would be an opportunity to make a sequel. The game went on to sell more than 5m copies across PlayStation, Dreamcast and Nintendo 64 and its success spawned one of the most popular franchises in video game history, generating more than $1.4bn in sales.Within days of release, it was clear players were forming a deeper relationship with the sim than either the developer or publisher had ever expected. People who’d never skated before were sharing button combinations for their favourite moves, discussing routes and arguing over which professional skateboarders were the best. Each freestyle area was designed to allow easy exploration and experimentation, and players could discover moves simply by hitting and combining buttons and seeing what happened.The simple joy of discovering the best ways to rack up the highest combo scores, and the easy feel of gliding from ramp to rail as you tied together a medley of tailgrabs, heelflips and madonnas with nosegrinds and boardslides, had players hooked plus, the way these terms appeared on screen meant they slipped into each player’s vocabulary. You needed to spend only a couple of hours with the game to feel like a pro.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater (THPS) was accessible, but it wasn’t shallow. In order to appeal to hardcore skaters and newcomers, Neversoft knew the game had to accurately simulate the feel, culture and aesthetic of skateboarding. Activision brought in Hawk, an experienced pro, as a figurehead for the title in late 1998, but, as an avid gamer, he was keen to add more to the project than just his name. The skate scene legend was in constant touch with the development team to ensure they stayed true to the sport.“I would get updated game builds sent to me every week, play them extensively and give feedback,” he says. “I would provide them with video examples of specific tricks beyond doing a full day of motion capture for the basics. I also consulted with the other featured skaters in order to have a sense of democracy for what should be included, and proper names. Some of them are still upset that I went with ‘Ollie North’ instead of ‘Ollie one-foot’.”The development team quickly became familiar with all aspects of skate culture. There were regular team visits to the arcade opposite the game’s studio as they devoted hours to playing and analysing the arcade unit that housed Sega’s Top Skater. When the team weren’t working on THPS or playing video games, they were hanging out in the backyard of studio founder Joel Jewett, who built a quarter-pipe for the designers to skate on.“We had an awesome team,” says Scott Pease, then studio director at Neversoft, who worked on the THPS series from its first title until 2007. “Everyone was super into skateboarding, and that just bled out into the game.“At the same time, skateboarding itself was really expressing itself as a cultural phenomenon. Kids were putting out these legendary skating videos and stamping them with their own unique style. All of these skaters had a different feel – this guy’s heavy metal, this guy’s hip-hop – so it was a super vibrant culture. We were just trying to make a video game that was true to that.”To ensure the accessibility of the sim, the developers didn’t want to punish players for struggling to land moves. Consequently, they built in a forgiving gameplay system they named “trick slack”, which meant players could still land their tricks even if the frames in the character animation hadn’t completed when the board touched down. The subsequent trick doesn’t look as neat, but it’s better than having the player crash out and fail every few seconds – and a “sketchy landing”, as it was called in the game, is something most real-life skateboarders know all about.“It just really helped make the game feel good,” says Pease, “and the whole idea of doing combos naturally fell out of putting the skaters in those environments and designing these levels with skate obstacles in mind. With the trick slack, the whole trick linking system started to come together.”There’s a finite list of moves in the game but memorising and perfecting them provided an infinite number of ways to rack up combos. To progress through the game’s nine levels, players had to complete a variety of objectives, from reaching a high score and collecting S-K-A-T-E letters to finding the hidden VHS tapes stashed in hard-to-reach locations. The two-minute timeframe you had to do this in added an intensity and replayability to the games.The popular perception of sports sims is that they lead players away from indulging in their real-life equivalents, but THPS demonstrated this wasn’t always the case. As the series grew in popularity, a new generation of skateboarders emerged, many of whom discovered the skater identity – from fashion and music to the slang – through the Pro Skater titles. Even now, players easily recall the lyrics to tracks such as Superman by ska-punk band Goldfinger, Blood Brothers by nu-metallers Papa Roach and mimic the opening riff of 96 Quite Bitter Beings by CKY. Many more have wardrobes packed with skate brands such as Element, World Industries, DC and Birdhouse.The exhilarating rush players got from dropping into the Warehouse level for the first time could be replicated by picking up a skateboard in real life. For some fans, this realisation had a profound and lasting impact on their lives. “I know eight people from where I grew up who started skating just because of how much that game influenced them,” says 32-year-old skateboarder Christian Greenwood. “There must be thousands more of us all over the UK.”When skateboarder Paul Hilton studied the way characters such as Bob Burnquist, Bucky Lasek, Geoff Rowley and Andrew Reynolds moved the skateboard around their feet as they pulled off tricks in the game it helped him to replicate the moves in real life. “I remember learning how to ollie and then thinking, ‘Right, it’s time to learn kickflips.’ And because I didn’t really have much genuine exposure to the skateboarding scene, my only point of reference was the game, so I learned by copying the same method for kickflips that the game applied. I don’t think I’d have ever picked up a skateboard if it hadn’t been for those games.”The game also helped to push skateboarding into the mainstream. At the end of the 90s, skateboarding was slowly emerging from a lull in popularity and the games helped raise awareness of the sport. “They inspired a generation of gamers to appreciate and, in many cases, try skateboarding and the culture surrounding it,” says Hawk. “It was the tipping point for skating in terms of no longer being considered an underground or ‘alternative’ sport.”The legacy of the THPS games can still be felt. Jordan Thackeray, a 22-year-old skateboarder from Norfolk, is participating in Olympic qualifying events with the aim of competing in the Games’ inaugural skateboarding competition. Thackeray was introduced to skateboarding after his grandparents bought him a copy of THPS. He asked his mum for a skateboard shortly afterwards.The series was influential beyond skating and helped shape careers across a variety of industries. “For many, the games came at a formative time in their lives,” says Hawk. “They picked up skating, a lasting taste in music and a sense that you don’t have to follow a stuffy career path to be successful.“Many people have told me that the game kickstarted their career in music, sports or film-making because they saw that we – as pro skaters – had a different, more refreshing approach to life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8d6d83db3f4027fb0b46ad276404d988154533f/0_325_4875_2925/master/4875.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c80e218793993e07cdad554d223c696d","title":"from delhi street child to acclaimed photographer vicky roy in pictures","story":"Vicky Roy has gone from surviving in a railway station on food scrounged from a train to an award-winning career in photography.

Otherwise, we should not be surprised if the lessons of Brixton’s riots in 1981 or London in 2011 play out in the streets of Belfast in some shape or form.”The QUB crime expert stressed that the rise in PSNI stop and searches, at a time when they have fallen in other UK constabularies’ areas, could not be solely put down to the continued dissident republican terror threat in Northern Ireland.Such a policy was criminalising young males in the region, Topping said.On the overall effect of stop and search, he said: “Whether it’s Brixton or the Bogside in Derry, when there are long histories of negative police-community relations, stop and search only serves to reinforce negative stereotypes and perceptions of the police – especially when it is used at high levels but with little crime effect.”Defending the PSNI’s policy of stop and search under the Misuse of Drugs Act, a spokesperson said: “PSNI officers have a power to stop and search iniduals where they have reasonable grounds to suspect an offence. Since April 2019, 749 young people were stopped and searched with three-quarter being under misuse of drugs legislation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

But what if we could harness them for our own good?‘Do you have a nemesis?” I asked the two men, friends of my flatmate, to whom I had just been introduced. We were at a gig, waiting for the band to come on. My flatmate wordlessly assumed an apologetic air, but one of his friends seized on my question like he thought I would never ask.“Yes,” he said, without any hesitation. I could almost see the face of his nemesis in his eyes, reflected in the stage lights. “He’s a social worker.”The other friend ummed, and ahhed, and cast his mind back to everyone he had ever met – including me, just now – before deciding that the closest he had had to a nemesis was a former colleague with whom he hadn’t got on very well, but even they had turned out all right in the end, so the answer was no, not really.For some months, I had been asking the same question of everyone with whom I had come into contact. I was writing a short book about the unexpected upsides of having a nemesis, and had come to recognise these as representative responses. Either your nemesis leapt to mind with an immediacy that suggested they were never far from there in the first place – or you tried to conjure one out of politeness to appease your friend’s intense flatmate.As is no doubt obvious from my question, I belong firmly in the first camp. As an ambitious, occasionally petty person, I have long understood that the power to motivate myself lies in an imagined competition with people who probably don’t think of me at all.At the time of writing I have four nemeses. Three were formed at old jobs, over professional slights or disagreements that are intensely felt but tedious to explain they themselves are oblivious. The fourth knows what she did.As I wrote at the time, I see my embrace of nemeses as fairly harmless. Picking a colleague to serve as your antagonist makes your life more like a sitcom, and less like wage slavery on the slow march towards death. And if they really are your antagonist, so much the better (so long as it is kept in check). In embracing the rivalry, you can unlock its potential benefits, and possibly, actually win.In sport, harnessing the power of competition to improve performance is well known. A 2014 study of long-distance runners found that those who recalled a rival reported significantly higher motivation than those who did not. Competing against a rival led to significantly faster times: an improvement of nearly five seconds a kilometre. Runners could be expected to run a five-kilometre race roughly 25 seconds faster if they were competing against one of their rivals than if they weren’t.Prof Brian Uzzi, an expert on leadership and social networks at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Illinois, says there are parallels with work and creativity. “The good kind of nemesis can really drive motivation, help you reach further, let you see the possibility to do things that you couldn’t before – things that might have been impossible. And all of that, to me, means opportunity in life.”Moreover, says Uzzi, a nemesis is somewhat inevitable once you reach a certain level in your career. “As you progress, your reputation builds and the probability of having someone that will be a nemesis also grows – either because your success is a threat to theirs or because, as you grow in authority, people become more critical of your behaviour.”In June he published the results of his two-year study of day traders, which showed that not only did they gravitate towards having a balance of friends and enemies in their professional networks, but that their performance improved when they achieved it. People look to be friends with their friend’s friend and the enemy of their enemy, and to oppose their friend’s enemy and their enemy’s ally.When those conditions are met, according to a framework called structural-balance theory reinforced by Uzzi’s study, a network is considered balanced – not, I note, when there are no enemies at all. It can be hard to push yourself in a vacuum it is quite a bit easier to want to do better than the guy clipping his toenails.A nemesis may even fulfil an important existential function. In 2010 researchers at the University of Kansas found that, “although superficially disagreeable”, seeing themselves as having powerful enemies allowed people to maintain a sense of personal control in the face of many more numerous and diffuse hazards.The paper’s authors also found that people tended to attribute greater power to an enemy at times when the government, law enforcement and the wider social system appeared to be chaotic and disordered. When you might feel you are losing control over your environment or destiny, an enemy “can be effectively controlled, managed or understood”.The key thing, says Uzzi, is to keep active conflict to a minimum. Friendly competition, not properly managed, can easily turn toxic, leaving the relationship beyond repair. “The bad kind of nemesis is something you really don’t want to develop, and if it does, you want to fix that or develop an exit strategy.” But the good kind is “someone who’s going to raise your game … They have to be people you want to compete with and do better than.”The Totaljobs survey found that most people identified office nemeses of the same gender and the same level of seniority (or higher) as them, which is revealing of the tendency to benchmark ourselves against broadly equivalent iniduals. Comparing yourself with others is of course fraught, and counter to the typical advice for achieving contentment – but it can be helpful in clarifying your own ambition.My emotional response to my nemeses’ activities and achievements – usually never even voiced – is often most revealing about my own desires and insecurities. If their news makes me churn internally, I realise that it is something I want for myself, encouraging me to think about taking steps to make it happen. Equally, when it stirs in me disproportionate emotion, I have learned that it means there are probably more complicated factors at play.Prof Barbara Louise Gray – a former director of the Center for Research in Conflict and Negotiation at Penn State University – says it is worth paying attention to people who push your buttons as they can teach you about yourself.According to Jungian psychology, everyone has a “shadow self”, informed by our upbringing and cultural training, that we subconsciously strive to keep hidden when we have a strong emotional response to someone, we might be projecting on them characteristics that we struggle to accept in ourselves.Your nemesis, then, can be a prompt for useful introspection. “Try as you might to change someone else, as most people in marriages know, that doesn’t work very well,” says Gray. “So you have to turn the light around and shine it on yourself: ‘Why am I so teed off by this person? Why does this person rub me the wrong way all the time?’”Identifying traits you are intolerant of in others may reveal those that you work to conceal in yourself, says Gray, and thereby present an opportunity for personal growth. Learning to accept our shadow selves as they are reflected in other people can be a humbling experience, one that can make us more confident and effective in our relationships and happier in ourselves.The cliche that we are our own worst enemy may be true, but an external one can help that process of introspection along, says Gray. She adds that it is important to be attuned to your behaviour, and any patterns in the things that provoke you in others. “The key for an inidual is to know when their buttons are pushed, and when it evokes a really strong reaction in them – that’s the time to say: ‘OK, I have a nemesis operating in here that I probably ought to meet.’”Why Everyone Needs a Nemesis: Harnessing Pettiness For Greatness by Elle Hunt is available in audiobook and eBook, published by Hodder \u0026amp Stoughton, £3.99"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27148b985211766072a3d88db43f5b44e48301ab/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=baf4fd8e31143849a1e39a3ac2a44a2f","title":"lizzo is 100 that bitch but can she trademark it","story":"A British singer tweeted the line in 2017, creating controversy around Lizzo’s attempt to copyright the line, but this isn’t the first time it’s happenedSeven months later Lizzo released Truth Hurts, which features the same memorable line. (If you’re wondering why the song only became so popular recently, it’s because it was featured on the Netflix rom-com Someone Great, which came out in April.)So did she steal Mina Lioness’s tweet? Not according to Lizzo. When confronted about the meme in early 2018, the singer tweeted: “Ive never seen this before in my life…But u know…The odds of multiple people having the same idea are VERY high.”Shortly after that, however, Lizzo tweeted Mina Lioness and explained:The 2018 back-and-forth didn’t get much attention. However, the controversy flared back up again last week after Mina Lioness discovered that Lizzo, now a mega-star, had filed a trademark application. “What I cannot get over is how brazen Lizzo and her team have been in ignoring my whole presence,” Mina Lioness tweeted on Saturday. “They’re doing it because they know I have no capital to address her. I’m just the poor Black girl from London that don’t have a dog in the fight.”Here’s the thing: even if Lizzo did take Mina Lioness’s tweet, it doesn’t really matter when it comes to intellectual property (IP) law. Simply tweeting a phrase doesn’t grant you any legal rights.Deborah Peckham, an IP specialist at Boston-based law firm Burns \u0026amp Levinson, notes that if Mina Lioness had commercialized her tweet by, for example, printing it on T-shirts, or using it as a tagline for services, then she might have grounds to contest Lizzo’s trademark application. However, “merely saying a short phrase or word in public doesn’t give you a legal monopoly over it.”Mina Lioness isn’t the only person to have found this out the hard way. Speaking over the phone, Matt Schimkowitz, senior editor at Know Your Meme (the Wikipedia of memes) notes that “Peaches Monroe has claimed for years now that she got unfairly treated in the ‘on fleek’ trend, when people were putting it on t-shirt without crediting her.”To refresh your memory: Monroe, whose real name is Kayla Newman, popularized the phrase ‘“on fleek” in 2014 when the teenager uploaded a Vine of herself saying “eyebrows on fleek”. The short video got over 20m views in five months and it wasn’t long before brands had appropriated it for marketing tweets, like IHOP’s “pancakes on fleek” tweet.Nicki Minaj also used the phrase in her hit song Feeling Myself, and took credit for introducing it to the world. Minaj even called out singer Christina Milian for printing “On Fleek” on T-shirts, joking that she was waiting for her percentage of the royalties. It seems like the only person who didn’t monetize the meme was the young black woman who created it.Kids getting exploited for their unpaid viral labour is, of course, how the digital economy tends to work. Schimkowitz notes that “a lot of people who are creating memes are teenagers” who don’t automatically protect their viral creations with trademark applications. And while monetizing memes may be a modern phenomenon, Schimkowitz points out that “marketing people taking trends from teens is not a new thing – that’s being happening since they invented teenagers”.This isn’t to say that young meme-makers never profit from their viral frame. However, it does seem that the kids who get credit for their creations tend to be white, while the kids who have their work appropriated tend to be black. In 2016, for example, a teenager called Daniel Lara shot to international fame after a video of his friend yelling “Damn Daniel, back at it again with the white Vans” went viral. Lara got a lifetime supply of Vans, was invited on Ellen, and trademarked the phrase Damn Daniel through the company Damn Daniel LLC.Danielle Bregoli, who went viral in 2016 for saying what sounded like “Cash me ousside” and “how bout dat” on Dr Phil, has also cashed in on her 15 minutes of fame. She trademarked both phrases and has threatened legal action against companies using them. Bregoli now has a $1mn publishing deal with Pulse Music Group and a $900,000 partnership with CopyCat Beauty. All thanks to going viral when she was 13.Now, let’s say you’ve just fired off a hilarious tweet and are watching it transform into a viral meme in front of your eyes. If you call up a trademark lawyer quickly enough, are you going to be laughing all the way to the bank? Not necessarily.Sometimes memes or phrases become so ubiquitous that they are impossible to trademark. Peckham notes, for example, that that US Trademark Office declined to register applications to trademark OCCUPY WALL STREET (yes, I regret to inform you people really tried to trademark OCCUPY), explaining that “the more commonly a phrase is used, the less likely that the public will use it to identify only one source and the less likely that it will be recognized by purchasers as a trademark”.Ultimately, says Peckham, there are two big lessons to take away from the Lizzo trademark dispute. First, “if you want to protect or leverage your great idea or catchy phrase, you should act fast before it goes viral”.Second, the internet always wins in the end. “Even if the law isn’t on the side of the original writer of the tweet, the power of the internet might still ensure that a second user (Lizzo) cannot cash in by getting a monopoly on the phrase either. The internet will likely own it in the long run … which means we can all go on claiming we are all that bitch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f20f920f5ed52e0403de8d4812f40b4c69dc83ba/449_312_917_550/master/917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e454c78ecc22cc87c41ec54937db71ce","title":"you never forget the first time how i lost my investment virginity","story":"Many of us have the sense that our money could be doing more than sitting in a savings account, albeit with some apprehension about what else to do with it. But for Danielle Graph, becoming a first-time investor was less scary than it seemedI’m a control freak. It isn’t my most endearing quality, but it does mean that when it comes to things such as life admin and money matters, I try to heed the girl scout motto and be prepared for every eventuality. But, for some reason, I’ve never tried investing before.I’m lucky enough to have a few work-based pensions, which will apparently provide me with a grand sum of £365 per month to help me heat my home and fill my shopping trolley, once I’m of retirement age. And because I’m constantly thinking and worrying about the future, whenever I’ve found myself with any financial headroom, I’ve been diligent about saving.At the moment, though, I’m finding that, week-by-week, I’m just getting by. I work for a website part-time and my husband is in the luxury goods market, which has been hit by the recent economic uncertainty. Plus, our cost of living just seems to keep on rising – our car, our kids’ after-school clubs, even our cats seem to be getting more expensive.So I’ve decided to try to improve our financial future by dipping my toe into the big wide world of investments. This is completely new territory for me. My only experience of investment pretty much extends to watching Damian Lewis in Billions. Indeed, when people tell me that they “invest”, I can’t help picturing a 1980s yuppie in pinstripes and braces, shouting “loadsamoney” into a brick mobile phone. Can this really be for me?I start researching investments online: the words float across the screen like a different language. I wonder to myself why I’ve never tried investing before? Perhaps it has something to do with my control-freak tendencies? And yet, deciding to invest actually feels like taking control. So, undeterred by some of the jargon I encounter online, I take £1,000 out of our stagnant savings and resolve to try and make it grow. Watch out Wall Street, this twice failing maths GCSE pupil is coming for you.No matter how much I psych myself up, however, the shameful truth is I still have no idea where to really begin. So I turn to my bank, HSBC, and phone its investment helpline. I kick off my chat with the super helpful specialist by asking her to explain everything as if she’s talking to a five-year-old. I tell her I have £1,000 to invest, where do I start? (Though it’s worth noting that you can start investing in some places from only £100.)For a Joe Average like me, the specialist explains that this isn’t some get rich quick scheme, but instead to think about this for the long term – at least a five-year timeframe. Mentally, I start planning a family holiday to Disney World five years down the line. She then checks that I’ve got an emergency fund in place for dealing with any unexpected expenses. Next, we chat about how I might make the best decision for me, where I’d feel most comfortable putting my money and about the various investment options that are available. I make notes – lots of notes. It’s a lot of information to absorb, but once I have the basics, I hang up the phone and bolster what I’ve just been told with information from HSBC’s website, where everything is clearly covered. Then I phone back the helpline with further queries. This approach seems to work best for me, and gives me the best of both worlds: the personal touch over the telephone, plus the chance to supplement what I learn in my own time and at my own pace. Helpfully, everything I’ve discussed with the specialist is available online, including a timely reminder that, when it comes to investments, I may not get back what I put in – along with a brilliant jargon buster which has found itself a special place in my bookmarks toolbar.I focus on three distinct investment options. The first involves opening an account to buy shares in inidual companies – companies whose shares are publicly traded in the stock market. I keep visualising shares as if they’re slices of one giant pizza – the publicly-traded companies get sliced into so many pieces, and you then can buy a slice, or a few slices. Of course, it would have to be the world’s biggest pizza given the sheer number of shares that are typically issued. Plus, it starts making me hungry. The second option involves putting your money into a fund-based investment. A fund is basically a group of investors who collectively put their money together in one basket, and that money is spread out, across a whole range of investments.Thirdly, you can invest in a portfolio, which is basically a collection of different funds.All of these options can also can be undertaken via a stocks and shares ISA (Inidual Savings Accounts). The benefits of an ISA are that you don’t pay income or capital gains tax on what you earn, but you are limited to a maximum of £20,000 investment per year. You can split your ISA allowance between stocks and shares, and cash – a cash ISA being similar to a savings account that offers instant access to your money. A stocks and shares ISA could potentially earn you more money than the alternative, however, there is a greater risk attached, as your money is invested in stocks and shares, which can go down, as well as up.As one of my cats peers over the top of my laptop, meowing for yet more food, she reminds me of all our day-to-day expenses and why I need to try and secure a better financial future for my family. Taking in two kittens from a cat shelter seemed like the best idea at the time, but I had no idea they’d bump up our monthly costs by a rather massive £100, for cat food, litter and insurance.Now that I’m armed with decidedly more knowledge than when I started, I brew a strong cup of Earl Grey, crack open a packet of shortbread and mull over how I want to lose my investment virginity. I decide I don’t want any additional tax worries (who does?) which is why I’m going down the ISA route. I’m also looking for an investment that doesn’t require any work on my part, which is why I opt for something HSBC calls a “managed” solution, which means they take care of managing my funds and keep me updated in regular statements. I choose a stocks and shares ISA which invests in funds, rather than the alternative which invests in shares on the stock market. For the final step, I go through an online process using HSBC’s My Investment tool, which involves answering multiple, intricate questions about my finances, assessing if I can afford to invest, and delving deeply into how I feel about risk. The depth of the questions reassures me rather than puts me off – and it’s been written in a plain, easy to understand language. The tool processes my answers and conclude that I’m a person who’s comfortable with risk – so I opt for the high risk portfolio it recommends.The cost of setting up my ISA is £7.50 with an estimated* £4.50 per annum account fee. It’s been surprisingly straightforward and I bask in the positive feeling of having taken some control over my money. In fact, when I log in to my online banking app moments later, there sits my ISA account, holding my £1,000. I take a mental picture of the moment. After all, you never forget your first time.To invest or access investment advice through HSBC you must be and existing HSBC UK current or savings account customer.

This has gone on for over five years (as you’ll see from the correspondence I have forwarded to you). The company keeps saying my postcode is not covered by deliveries from its Perth store – I am apparently on the “wrong” side of the border – and that there is nothing they can do.

So you will be able to see the new slots from 1 October. It says: “It’s common practice to expand our catchment areas following feedback … and often add inidual postcodes to the home delivery service.” We hope it’s worth the five-year wait!Following our recent item on Whirlpool about a reader whose supposedly “safe” dryer turned out to be one at risk of bursting into flames, we received this letter which suggests it was not a “one-off”:Like AK of Brighton I, too, checked Whirlpool’s website to see if my Hotpoint dryer (purchased sometime around 2008) was safe and got the response that it was “not one of the affected models”.This was in June 2016 when I was letting out my house. I took a screenshot of the response and gave it to my tenants – a professional couple with a baby – to reassure them the dryer was safe.I have been back in my house for about a year so you can imagine my horror when, on hearing the latest announcement by Whirlpool, I checked its website and this time got the response that my dryer was, in fact, affected. This was earlier this month and I received my replacement dryer yesterday (all handled very efficiently).However, the thought of what might have happened to my tenants and their little girl in the two years they lived in my house haunts me. I plan to use my new dryer very sparingly but you can rest assured I will not leave it unattended when I do. How can I trust this company?BS, LondonWhirlpool apologised for the distress and added that safety is its top priority. It said it was “difficult to determine the exact cause” as to why your machine was not identified earlier as at risk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaf5d2aec2f80f1304a6f9e8a4a8e6ec158a76f0/0_1380_7300_4380/master/7300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c1940d8487468b10fe47b829d261a3a","title":"the man who gave birth podcast","story":"Freddy McConnell is a  journalist and trans man who in 2016 decided to begin the process of conceiving and delivering his own child.

Alex Ledsom unearths its treasuresHike Cannes’ beachesAfter the Romans departed in the 5th century, the Lérins Abbey and its monks controlled this entire coastline, harvesting wine under a vow of silence. Nowadays, they live off the coast of Cannes on Île Saint-Honorat, an inexpensive ferry hop away. The island of Sainte-Marguerite, next door, is where the Man in the Iron Mask was held prisoner. Taste the wine on a tour of the cellars and hike the wild coves and beaches.Discover impressionism among Nice’s leafy Roman suburb, CimiezThe Romans founded the city of Cemenelum in the hills above modern-day Nice (the amphitheatre ruins are a great picnic spot), and Queen Victoria holidayed here centuries later. Visit the Musée Matisse, close to where French painter Henri Matisse lived, and a few streets away, fellow impressionist painter Marc Chagall’s museum, of whom Picasso said: “When Matisse dies, Chagall will be the only painter who understands what colour really is.” Entry is free to both museums with the French Riviera pass.Ride the oceanside train from MonacoThe major towns on the Côte d’Azur are linked by a coastal train route, which for a few euros offers unrivalled views and avoids the traffic – it takes just 25 minutes from Monte Carlo to Nice (the same again to Cannes), and only 15 minutes from Nice to Antibes. Take in some literature as you rumble through the region think Francois Sagan’s Bonjour Tristesse (set on the Côte d’Azur and one of Le Monde’s 100 best books of the century) or F Scott Fitzgerald’s Tender is the Night, which used the majestic Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes as a backdrop. Pick up some fritters from the stalls at Condamine market in Monte Carlo for your journey they’re called Barbajuan (uncle John), named after the man who supposedly fried his ravioli when he couldn’t find any sauce to accompany them.Discover traditional fishing life at Port de l’OlivetteThe Grimaldi family’s 14th-century chateau forms the cultural heart of Antibes’ old town, and houses the Picasso museum, where he painted for six months in 1946. Traditional fishing still happens at Port de l’Olivette, on the other side of the bay. Have a drink, watching the sailors come and go on wooden boats.Swim in Billionaires’ Bay at Cap d’AntibesThe 5km hike from Plage de la Garoupe winds its way gently up and around Antibes’ headland, over rocky outcrops and through the scent of wild herbs. Stop for a swim in Billionaires’ Bay, admiring some of the most expensive houses in the region from the turquoise waters below.Tuck into street food at Nice’s flower marketLocal farmers have been selling their wares under the striped awnings of Nice’s Cours Saleya market since 1897. Just like Marché Forville in Cannes, it’s a great place to people-watch and become acquainted with tasty street food. Legend has it that the batter for the local chickpea pancake, socca, was poured on the heads of invading Turks in the 16th century. It was later served up to peasants throughout the 19th century, as an afternoon snack or merenda. Socca is cooked like a crepe, costs next to nothing and is beloved by renowned chefs such as Yotam Ottolenghi. The region is also home to pan bagnat, a sandwich made from wheat bread called pain de campagne (literally “bread from the countryside”), rubbed with garlic and olive oil. It’s filled with the contents of salad niçoise – boiled eggs, succulent local tomatoes, fresh tuna, anchovies (optional) and Provençal olives – and drizzled with vinegar.Cool off on Nice’s Castle HillNice’s Colline du Château once housed an impregnable fortress, which was taken down and redesigned as a park in the early 19th century for the influx of European visitors. Take the tourist train from Promenade des Anglais, ride in the lift or climb the steps (the park is 93 metres above the Baie des Anges), cooling off next to the impressive manmade waterfall, built from bricks taken from the castle’s dungeon.Visit Cannes’ medieval fortress and fishing quarterIn the 12th century, the monks built a coastal fortress called Musée de la Castre, which today houses an eclectic art collection. Climb its 109 steps for sublime 360-degree views over the small fishing village of Le Suquet, which grew over the course of 400 years into present-day Cannes.

However, it is understood that if the order paper is revised to make space for the backbench bill seeking to delay Brexit, it could take place as a written statement.The Treasury said the extra £2bn would be spent on post-Brexit projects and would include cash for the Border Force, for the Department for Transport to assist ports, and for a possible UK replacement for the EU’s Galileo satellite navigation system.The £8.3bn running total for no deal comprises the original £4.2bn, an extra £2.1bn allocated in August for contingencies such as stockpiling medicines, an additional 500 border officials and a public awareness campaign, and the new £2bn.In a statement before the spending round, Javid said: “One of my first acts as chancellor was to announce £2.1bn additional funding to prepare to leave the EU. We’ve now provided £8.3bn to help departments prepare for Brexit. This new funding will ensure that departments can grasp the opportunities created by Brexit after we leave on 31 October.”In an earlier update to MPs on no-deal planning, Michael Gove, who leads on the issue for the government, said the Operation Yellowhammer dossier on no-deal risks – which has been leaked but not published – depicted a “reasonable” worst-case scenario.“Operation Yellowhammer assumptions are not a prediction of what is likely to happen. They are not a best-case scenario or a list of probable outcomes, they are projections of what may happen in a worst-case scenario,” he said.Gove conceded there would be issues connected to no deal, such as tariffs and checks on the Irish border. He added that while businesses and the public should not be “blithe or blase” about the challenges, the risks could be mitigated and “we can be ready”.Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said Gove’s statement was “rather vacuous”, adding that if a general election was called he would ask the civil service to publish all documents related to no-deal preparations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7e95b9714d6314203ed13584fcf988a550b69fa/0_4_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37b497b0377b5d1763ec5520a1f129c9","title":"sturgeon seek legal powers hold new scottish independence referendum","story":"Scottish first minister outlines legislative programme with plan for referendum next yearNicola Sturgeon has said she will ask for the legal powers to stage a new independence referendum next year as she unveiled a swathe of measures to combat climate heating.The first minister told MSPs on Tuesday she would ask the UK government for a section 30 order enabling Holyrood to hold a second independence vote once a new Scottish referendum bill is passed.Over the next year, the Scottish government would also spend £500m to improve the country’s buses, set a new target to decarbonise the Scottish rail network by 2035, and fund a £3bn green new deal package coordinated by a new Scottish investment bank.Coupled with measures on health inequalities and cutting waste, Sturgeon said her ambitious legislative programme stood in stark contrast to the political and constitutional emergency gripping Westminster. The Brexit crisis meant it seemed inevitable there would be an early general election, she added.She did not mention polls that indicate the Scottish National party would win more than 50 of Scotland’s 59 Commons seats, but said she wanted to be prepared. “We intend to offer the people of Scotland the choice of a better and more positive future as an independent nation,” she said.“We will seek agreement to the transfer of power that will put the referendum beyond legal challenge. We have a clear democratic mandate to offer the choice of independence within this term of parliament – and we intend to do so.”Ian Blackford, the SNP’s Westminster leader, said earlier on Tuesday an election gave his party “a fantastic opportunity” to strengthen the mandate for independence. It would allow Scotland’s voters “to send a very clear message to Westminster that we should be able to determine our own future”, he said.Speaking in Holyrood as she unveiled the next year’s programme for government, Sturgeon said the carbon emergency would be the centrepiece of its legislation and spending.She said the programme included:• Making the Highlands and islands the first “net zero” aviation zone in the world by 2040.• Producing regulations to make sure all new homes would include renewable or low carbon heat from 2024.• Consulting on introducing zero-emissions city centres by 2030.• Helping the oil and gas industry invest in carbon capture and storage.• Exploring the scope for a hydrogen refuelling network and explore using hydrogen to power trains in remote areas.Among other measures, Sturgeon said another £20m would be spent on tackling Scotland’s drugs deaths crisis a fresh initiative to improve mental health for women reform of Scotland’s defamation laws new powers for local councils to introduce tourist levies such as bed taxes and enable new charges for single-use disposable coffee cups.Sturgeon’s emphasis on tackling the climate crisis was welcomed by environmental campaigners. Glasgow is expected to be the host city for next year’s COP26 global climate summit and Sturgeon wants to show her government is taking leadership on the climate.Richard Dixon, the director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said the positive measures Sturgeon unveiled were undermined by the serious contradiction of continuing to support maximum extraction of North Sea oil and gas. North Sea drilling should be phased out quickly, he said.Carbon capture and hydrogen were “dangerous distractions” since they promoted continued use of fossil fuels, he said. “The climate emergency should signal a radical change of direction, especially when it comes to planning the end of oil and gas extraction from the North Sea.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/161729be26e748a9935d24b161e894cbd3cf807d/408_2_1592_955/master/1592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01fb210e0ff08255a3ac70eaada48d52","title":"corbyn to support snap election only if no deal brexit is blocked","story":"Labour leader warns Boris Johnson his MPs will only vote for election once no-deal off tableJeremy Corbyn has warned Boris Johnson that Labour will only vote for a snap general election once parliament has prevented a no-deal Brexit.After Tuesday night’s overwhelming government defeat, Labour’s leader told the prime minister that his MPs would only vote it through once they have halted the possibility of leaving the EU without a deal.Corbyn and Keir Starmer had earlier consulted lawyers and parliamentary clerks as they sought a way to support a general election while also halting Johnson’s plan to head towards a possible no-deal Brexit.It follows fears, highlighted on Monday by the former Labour leader Tony Blair, that supporting government plans for a general election would give it a free hand to change the polling date during an election campaign.After the government suffered a defeat of 328 votes to 301, Johnson immediately told the Commons that he would table a motion seeking a general election rather than accept a bill which would rule out a no deal.Corbyn replied: “He wants to table a motion for a general election, fine. Get the bill through first in order to take no-deal off the table.”Labour whips managed to hold down the number of rebels. Two Labour MPs – John Mann and Kate Hoey – voted with the government, while two others – Kevin Barron and Derek Twigg – abstained.Starmer tweeted: “Hugely important first step in stopping Boris Johnson’s plan for a no-deal Brexit. Important we remain united in making sure the bill becomes law in the coming days.”Earlier in the day, Labour’s leader and the shadow Brexit secretary were examining plans which might avoid leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October, as threatened by the prime minister.It is understood that Labour wanted to use parliamentary procedure to force the Conservatives to hold an election on a particular date, instead of giving Johnson an option of moving it until after 1 November.Labour’s chief whip, Nick Brown, told the parliamentary Labour party that they would not back the prime minister’s snap election plans if it might lead to a no-deal Brexit.Clive Efford, the MP for Eltham, asked Brown about comments from Tony Blair in which the former Labour prime minister said supporting a general election would be an “elephant trap” because it would give the government a free hand to change the polling date during an election campaign.Brown was applauded by a packed meeting after replying that Labour would not support a general election that could lead to a no-deal Brexit, a Labour source said.“There was not that much detail, there was just an unequivocal assurance,” the MP Clive Lewis said.The choice of polling day is in the gift of the prime minister, who advises the Queen as to which date to proclaim. Johnson could, in theory, schedule an election for after no-deal, in another move that would push the bounds of convention without breaking the law.Concerns about the possible manoeuvre were raised following a rally in Salford on Monday night, when Corbyn said: “I will be delighted when the election comes. I’m ready for it, you’re ready for it – we’ll take that message out there and above all we will win.”His enthusiasm caught some Labour frontbenchers by surprise, after a meeting of key opposition figures last week at which it was agreed the first priority was legislation to block a no-deal Brexit.One shadow minister told the  it would be “wholly irresponsible” to agree to an election before 31 October – but another claimed the doubts about an election emanated from MPs who were sceptical about Corbyn’s leadership.“Some of the people saying, ‘we can’t have a general election’, are just frightened Jeremy will actually win,” one shadow minister said.Earlier on Tuesday, Corbyn suggested his party would back a general election – but only if it could also block a no-deal Brexit.After another cross-bench meeting, Corbyn said: “Labour wants to prevent a no-deal Brexit, and to have a general election, so we can end austerity and invest in our communities. I am confident we can have both, and we’ve been in discussions about a way to achieve this.”Whether or not Johnson succeeds in forcing a general election, few at Westminster doubt that one is likely in the coming weeks and months, and Labour MPs are turning their minds to the contest ahead.There is likely to be a lively debate about whether the party’s manifesto should leave open the possibility of going ahead with Brexit.Labour MPs in leave-voting areas were targeted by party whips seeking to defeat the government.Leave supporter MP Ronnie Campbell, who has rebelled against Labour several times and backed the government on Brexit, said: “I’m a leaver, there’s no doubt about it – but on this I’m half and half.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5645aef0f35dc3721bc3c8a8d431dafc142cbc8/0_178_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72db51359a86485d1a8c4de5cbff74fd","title":"parliament returns for brexit showdown today in focus podcast","story":"Jonathan Freedland joins Anushka Asthana to discuss a pivotal week ahead in British politics.

That’s it. I was able to play with it. My bad not to win.”The third-seeded Swiss made 61 unforced errors to 40 winners but the miscues, including 33 off an uncharacteristically erratic forehand, only mounted as Dimitrov dragged him further into deep waters in the third and fourth sets over a series of gruelling baseline rallies. The strategy, as the Bulgarian described it afterward, was attritional war.“One of the only things for me was try to keep him as much as possible on the court,” he said. “I did that very well. A lot of long games. Yeah, clearly in the end he was not at his best. I used every opportunity I had.”Dimitrov, who had been on the wrong end of all seven career meetings with Federer and lost 16 of the 18 sets played, then breezed to the finish line and into a third career major semi-final, where he will face No 5 seed Daniil Medvedev on Friday.Federer, who was the oldest player to reach the last eight at a major since a 39-year-old Jimmy Connors’ semi-final run at the 1991 US Open, was off to the races after breaking in his first return game and taking the opening set in under a half hour, but Dimitrov was undeterred and drew first blood in the seventh game of the second on his way to leveling the match at a set apiece.Even as Federer broke twice in the third to comfortably stake a two-sets-to-one advantage, the errors started to pile up as the rallies began to lengthen on Dimitov’s mandate. Try as he did to shorten the points with frequent net approaches – nearly three times as many (56) as Dimitrov (20) on the night – Federer’s unraveling continued with one unforced error after another coming forward.Then came the taxing 55-minute fourth where Federer failed to convert all of his six break-point chances as he buckled under the constant pressure of Dimitrov’s deep, flat baseline groundstrokes peppered with unpredictable variety within the points. He was pushed in nearly every service game, including a feature-length 22-point hold while serving at 3-4 which appeared to exact a lasting toll on his fitness and nerve.“I was very happy even though I lost the game, I did exactly what I wanted to do,” Dimitrov said. “I think even when I lost that game, I was actually smiling going through the changeover because that game must have hurt him a lot. For me, it actually filled me up.”After the 28-year-old held to force a decider, Federer disappeared from the court for nearly 10 minutes for medical treatment as his emboldened opponent began doing push-ups by his chair to prevent cramping.Yet Federer’s form only dipped upon his return as the fifth set rapidly got away from him while a hush enveloped the 23,771-seat stadium. When he finally sprayed a forehand wide on match point after three hours and 12 minutes, the 38-year-old was left to rue another failed bid for a sixth championship at Flushing Meadows, where he has now gone 11 years without a title after winning five straight from 2004 through 2008.“Just low,” said Federer, who fell to 43-2 at the US Open against players outside the top 50, the first blemish coming last year against Australia’s John Millman. “Just disappointed it’s over because I did feel like I was actually playing really well after a couple of rocky starts. It’s just a missed opportunity to some extent that you’re in the lead, you can get through, you have two days off after. It was looking good.“But got to take the losses. They’re part of the game.”When asked about his future major prospects, Federer said: “I don’t have the crystal ball. Do you? So we never know. I hope so, of course. I think still it’s been a positive season. Disappointing now, but I’ll get back up, I’ll be all right.”Dimitrov, a former junior world No 1 who climbed as high as third in the ATP rankings only two years ago, entered the season’s final grand slam with 12 wins in 27 matches all year and losses in seven of his last eight, including one to the world No 405. He’s now into the semi-finals of a major for the third time after previous runs at the 2014 French and 2017 Australian.He added: “It was not a pretty time. I’m not going to lie. But for me also today, I don’t want to sound too humble, but it was just another match for me really. I don’t want to say I had nothing to lose, because I felt I did.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ba8c1eb0be0b4801d313d0bfae078b1a4f81d48/345_0_2319_1391/master/2319.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a75c563791e38be1743bb442aa6f7608","title":"ashes 2019 england v australia fourth test day one live cricket","story":"Joe Root announced England’s line-up yesterday, revealing one change to the XI that survived the Headingley heist and one reshuffle to the batting order. The headline is Craig Overton replacing Chris Woakes in a move that indicates England’s bowling strategy at Old Trafford will be to hit the deck hard rather than probe for sideways movement through the air. Meanwhile at the top of the order Jason Roy’s torturous start to the series as an opener has seen him cosseted down at four and Joe Denly entrusted with helping Rory Burns to see off the new ball. Australia delayed naming their final XI until the toss with Mitchell Starc named by Tim Paine as the final member of his bowling attack. The speedster replaces the rested James Pattinson for his first trundle of the series. The bigger news arrived yesterday with Usman Khawaja announced as the man to make way for the returning Steve Smith. The left-hander’s stock has fallen in quicktime on tour from a possible candidate to take over the captaincy to falling behind Matthew Wade, Travis Head, and Marnus Labuschagne in the pecking order. “The wicket looks a bit drier than you’d expect” says Tim Paine. Who adds he’s expecting pace and bounce (hence the inclusion of Starc) and also sees the benefit of the left-hander creating footmarks for Nathan Lyon - who may well be the danger man on this surface.Joe Root would also have batted first had he won the toss. Sounds like nobody wants to bat last. You wouldn’t let it lie, Ian Forth. “Talking of red rags to bulls, Jonathan, let’s talk about ‘Ye olde’ in Tanya’s otherwise excellent piece. First, there’s almost no evidence that ’olde’ was used for ‘old’ in the olden days. More importantly though, the ‘y’ in ‘ye’ is derived from the thorn symbol which no longer exists in English. It was pronounced as “th”. So ‘ye’ was pronounced ‘the’. Carry on pronouncing it ‘ye’ if you wish, it’s a free country (for now) - but remember it’s far more rewarding to correct people on the matter at parties.”“As usual I’m at a loss to understand the selection and batting order policy,” emails Kim Thonger. “Opening with Sam Curran and Jack Leach would have made more sense to me. They’re mentally stronger than most of the top order. I’m sadly fairly confident that Root will be trying to save our first innings (again) with Stokes by the tenth over. The scoreboard team might just as well put up 3 wickets down at start of play to save themselves time and effort. I pray (to my personal deity Richard Dawkins) that I’m wrong.” The Roy Delusion?Acres of newspaper have been filled this past week with pieces attempting to make sense of Ben Stokes and his astonishing feat. Rob Smyth filed one of the best. Stokes did not just bring England back from the dead last Sunday he brought them back from a cremation. It was an astonishing achievement, euphoric confirmation of his greatness. The relative modesty of Stokes’s numbers in Test cricket – he averages 36 with the bat, 32 with the ball – are sometimes used in evidence against him. But trying to assess his impact through statistics is like trying to quantify love. It should surprise nobody if Stokes gets a pair at Old Trafford. Anna Halford has solved Phil Rawlinson’s diplomatic incident. “I find the secret is all in the preparation,” she emails. “It might be a bit late for him, but I would recommend my approach of choosing a Belgian as a significant other. The worst that will happen is that you’ll be annoyed with their air of faint bemusement. I look forward to the grateful thanks of other OBO-ers whose relationship problems I have solved.” Smash cut to Oprah Winfrey handing out Belgians to her entire studio audience. Abhijato Sensarma ponders whether we’re watching the Ben Stokes Ashes or the Brexit Ashes? “Quite frankly, we needed the small break after all that the English cricketing summer has shown us so far. But now, both Brexit and Ben Stokes loom large over the public imagination. The former is a source of great misery for the English, but the latter has ignited a flicker of joy in their lives again. This sport transcends its immediate playing field ... Hopefully, this Test secures the series’ position as one which transcends time!”Ah, Manchester, don’t go changing. Rain fell this morning and showers remain a possibility during the hours of play. However, it is clear and dry right now and play should start on time.Delays for rain are also forecast (but less likely) tomorrow, almost certain on Friday, but then the weekend should* be dry. *This is Manchester, take nothing for granted. Part of what makes the Ashes such a special contest is the rich history at so many of the grounds. Tanya Aldred revisits some of the most memorable at Old Trafford, beginning with 2005.Despite its No 1 status in the Old Trafford Test pantheon – a claim that may have raised a modest eyebrow from Jim Laker, whose 19 for 90 in 1956 was not all bad – England did not win in 2005. In fact England have not beaten Australia at Old Trafford since ye olde 1981, when a fresh-faced, neatly bearded, slim, helmetless Ian Botham put on his spurs and gracefully slashed Australia for 118 – the innings he and Mike Brearley consider the greatest of his career.Adam Giles has enjoyed this week’s rearranging of deckchairs. “I think the switching of Denly and Roy might be a masterstroke by England,” he emails. “Perhaps those extra 5-10 balls will be the difference between Roy nicking off in the 3rd over and Roy nicking off in the 5th over.”Word from Old Trafford is Mitchell Starc is back. Confirmation at the toss. All the build-up to this match has suggested this Old Trafford track will play hard and bouncy. We know it usually accepts turn too. While all the attention has been on the pacemen those sound like ideal conditions for Nathan Lyon and his overspin. Rick Chapman has emailed questioning England’s momentum. “Weren’t England supposed to win the third Test in a canter with Smith out? Beware the wounded Aussies.” Sentiments I share. “Good morning Jonathan,” pleasure to have you around Phil Rawlinson. “Quick question how do other marriages work with one English and one Australian? My wife is from Melbourne and I’m from Croydon (don’t judge) and after the infamous 2009 Broad at the Oval tear up in the car which nearly resulted in a motorway crash, we have opted for a no gloatingno over the top celebrating methodology. This was stretched to the limit on day four at Headingley, but ultimately stood up. I even went to the other room to scream after the Lyon run out. Here’s to a great Test, and if I may (I know you always get these) if any of your readership are feeling generous we are trying to raise some money for The Royal Marsden hospital.”Well Phil, speaking from personal experience, it works best when one of you cares not a jot for sport. For example, my Australian wife is currently in A\u0026ampE while our half-English half-Australian son has a wound in his forehead stitched. Grant Marjoribanks, whose name I had great pleasure saying aloud, is first with the satire. “Strange days when the English middle order is the most stable institution in British public life,” he emails, “less than two weeks after being all out for 67.” It was the Benst of times, it was the worst of times... Soz Dickens. Ian Forth has come forth with an email. “With respect,” he opens, which is always a red flag. “I might just disagree with Vic here. Don’t Ashes get won by England at home with superhuman inidual efforts, above all else? Not saying others can’t chip in - but 8-43, 149*, 5-1, Gower in ’85, Flintoff’s over at Edgbaston, 154*, Flintoff bowling through a brick wall in ’09, Bell’s Ashes, Broad’s hot streaks, the Summer of Stokes…”Ali Martin has been studying both camps in the lead-up to the fourth Test. He heard Australian skipper Tim Paine say that he “lost a bit of sleep thinking how we’re going to get Stokes out”, while Stuart Broad warned the returning Steve Smith to expect no favours, especially from Jofra Archer: “The dream is someone nicks him off first ball and Jofra doesn’t get to bowl at him, but he doesn’t average 60-odd for nothing. There will be a period in this game where those two come together again and – touch wood – I’m on the pitch to view it.” I wonder if anybody will actually pay attention to the cricket today, what with all the Brexit ballyhoo that’s going on. Not even SKW is immune. Maybe Radio 4 should do an In Our Time on that time they invited Warnie onto the Today program.If you’re looking for a scene-setter, here’s Vic Marks from Old Trafford on the eve of the Test.The challenge for England is to win conventionally, without the necessity of a superhuman performance from one of their players to get them over the line. That tends to happen just once or twice in a generation. They desperately need runs from fresh sources. The challenge for Australia is to forget.Or you might fancy Matthew Engel’s take, one containing a particularly choice bon mot from Iron Mike. New game fresh start all square. England have momentum which indeed proved decisive in 1981 and 2005 when England also hit back spectacularly. On the other hand, as Mike Tyson almost said, everyone has momentum until they get a punch in the mouth.Hello everybody. Have you caught your breath yet? Heart rate returned to normal? Reconsidered the urge to call your newborn Ben? Good, because it’s Ashes time again, specifically live OBO coverage of the fourth Test from Old Trafford.The series scoreline reads one-all with two to play but that hides the evidence of an already extraordinary contest. From James Anderson’s injury to Ben Stokes’s masterpiece via Steve Smith’s comeback and 67 all out, there has barely been a dull moment since the opening ball at Edgbaston over a month ago.Attention now turns to Manchester where pop psychologists will be out in force to measure the impact of Stokes’s heroics on the Ashes combatants. Prevailing wisdom suggests England are now an unstoppable juggernaut while Australia will be mentally disintegrated after such an agonising defeat. I’m not so sure.Stick with us for the next few days to find out. You can even join in if you like while it all unfolds. For the next hour or so you can do that by contacting me on email or Twitter. Then once play gets under way at 11am BST, I’ll hand you over to Geoff Lemon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80404bda5fd454ea772055d9c8e2f480525bea84/0_0_2169_2953/master/2169.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=814bf80600a033a3bab735502d01ff3c 700w","title":"a glimpse behind the scenes of gizas grand egyptian museum","story":"Egypt’s vast, much-delayed museum is scheduled to open in 2020. But while Tutankhamun’s treasures are being readied for tourists, some critics see the building as a vanity projectIn the vast, shade-dappled atrium of Egypt’s new Grand Egyptian Museum, construction work surrounded a colossal statue of Ramses II, his left foot striding forward and fists clenched in readiness.Staff welcoming visiting journalists doled out assurances that the towering ancient sculpture was safe from the ongoing building works. On its journey to the new museum last year, the statue was accompanied by 11 horsemen in military dress, amid the sounds of the Egyptian national anthem.If promises of the museum’s imminent completion hold true, the 83-tonne depiction of the third pharaoh of the 19th dynasty of Egypt, also known as Ozymandias, will be the first sight that greets visitors as they enter the 500,000 sq metre museum next year. At more than nine metres tall, the statue almost reaches the vaulted ceiling of the cement structure that is expected to house 100,000 objects, many of which will be displayed for the first time, as well as a 250-seat 3D cinema and children’s museum. It will also have a panoramic view of the Great Pyramids of Giza. But when will it open?The $1bn museum has been plagued by delays since it was first scheduled to open in 2015, a decade after it was conceived. As construction workers filled the atrium and put finishing touches to intricate lattice-work panels that form the building’s front flank, officials said the project was almost finished. Local media recently extolled official claims that the museum will open by 2020.“The Grand Egyptian Museum is a gift from Egypt to the whole world,” said minister of antiquities, Khaled el-Enany, echoing a slogan used to promote the opening of a second Suez Canal channel in 2015, amid claims the mega-project would revitalise Egypt’s economy. Officials said they hoped the Grand Egyptian Museum would attract five million visitors every year, helping to boost tourism and, in turn, the country’s finances.The project’s engineers claim the insulated concrete design overcomes the challenge of desert temperatures, where the roof can easily heat up to 70C, keeping the interior and its precious contents at a stable 23C.The building will supersede the world-famous Egyptian Museum, sometimes called the Museum of Cairo, which was built in the centre of the city in 1901 and currently houses the world’s largest collection of Pharaonic antiquities, including the iconic gold funeral mask of Tutankhamun.The new museum will contain 7,000 sq metres dedicated to the boy-king, with the 5,400 objects retrieved from his tomb (discovered by Howard Carter in 1922) displayed together for the first time, including his three coffins and the funeral mask.One large gold-plated coffin was removed from Tutankhamun’s tomb in Luxor’s Valley of the Kings in July for the first time since its discovery, and trucked to Cairo for vital restoration work before display.“It was a delicate project, as the coffin is very fragile,” said El-Enany, stood in front of the gilded sarcophagus where it lay inside the conservation laboratory adjoining the museum. “We expect that it will take eight or nine months to reach a good enough state to display it by 2020.”Not everyone is impressed by the museum’s grand promises. “It’s a vanity project from the Hosni Mubarak regime,” said Egyptian archaeologist Monica Hanna, in reference to the former president who was deposed in 2011. “But we’ve inherited it, so now we have to live with it.”Mubarak’s Cairo 2050 plan, launched four years before his overthrow, envisioned displacing 7,000 citizens to build a wide tree-lined boulevard linking central Cairo to the pyramids and tourist attractions, including the Grand Egyptian Museum.“Tourists will come if we give them a different experience – we have the highest rate of non-returning tourists. Changing this means reducing harassment, proper public transport and clean bathrooms,” said Hanna. In 2018, a reported 11.3 million tourists visited Egypt, down on the pre-revolution high of 15 million in 2010.Officials remain hopeful that the new museum will gloss over Egypt’s recent troubles, including a car bomb outside a Cairo hospital in August and a roadside bomb that injured 17 when it struck a bus of tourists close to the museum site in May. British Airways provoked the ire of Egyptian ministries in July when it suspended flights to Cairo for a week, citing unnamed security concerns. Egypt’s minister of civil aviation also decided to levy a $25 service fee on all passengers departing Cairo airport beginning in November 2019, in addition to a $25 charge imposed in 2014.Yet Egyptian officials are hoping the fanfare to accompany the museum’s opening will draw visitors. “It will be an event you’ll never ever forget for the rest of your life,” promised Mostafa Waziry, head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

I don’t know if it’s the makeup, hiding their real faces if it’s the sense of enforced fun, this idea that you’ve got to be laughing, that the laughter should never end or maybe it’s just that we don’t like anything that tricks us, repeatedly, and makes us keep coming back for more. Clowns are fools who enjoy making others look foolish, after all. Nothing more distrustful than that.But did we always find them absolutely terrifying? Or is that terror because of something Stephen King has done to our collective unconscious? I read It when I was 13 or so. And what scared me from the book wasn’t even really Pennywise the Dancing Clown it was the giant spider, it was the assorted Universal monsters It took the form of, it was Henry Bowers the bully.After all, the clown was a form that It took in order to lure kids to it, to get them close. It was unsettling but theoretically harmless – as much as King knew that readers would be scared of them, he also knew that we were fascinated, amused, entertained. What better way to get a kid to a sewer than the promise of a balloon? What better way to mask screams than giggles of laughter? I didn’t like Pennywise, but it didn’t keep me up at night.And then I saw the 1990 television adaptation. Here’s how I remember the experience: it’s hours and hours long, this massive, sprawling thing, bridging the story of the Losers’ Club meeting It when they’re children, and then returning to defeat it as adults. Hours and hours of horror, of Pennywise tormenting the Losers’ Club. There was the giant spider, sure, and Henry Bowers’ terrible shock-white hair and there were abuses and losses of innocence and personal demons, but most of all there was Pennywise. Tim Curry’s performance, seemingly designed to be simultaneously repulsive and alluring – let’s not pretend there isn’t some of that Rocky Horror showmanship there, a suggestion you want to see more of where Pennywise will take its routines – was unbearably unsettling.After it got its hooks into you, the flakiness didn’t matter. The script didn’t matter. What mattered was Pennywise, somehow the second most terrifying thing I could think of. (For what it’s worth, the first was the twins from Kubrick’s The Shining.) It wasn’t even those Lon Chaney in The Phantom of the Opera teeth, or the way that his head reared back to show those teeth in all their terrible glory. It was his eyes: with their curiously pathetic puppy-dog quality to them, these unerringly human bits of the person behind the mask.I forced my sister to watch it with me, of course. She was four years younger than I was, coerced into being some sort of co-pilot on my teenage horror adventures: somebody physically there with me so that I could act like I wasn’t scared, but in whom I could see the effects of the horror itself. (I realise now, writing this, that my behaviour sounds a little like that of a nascent serial killer, torturing animals just to see what happens.) I’m not sure that she truly understood It, and I don’t know if she’s ever subsequently read the book. But I do know that for her, and for many people around the world, Pennywise has become the reason that clowns are scary.To this day, it’s Pennywise that people turn to if you ask them to picture a scary clown. Far more people than ever read the book have seen pictures of Curry’s Pennywise, or have watched clips, or remember their siblings forcing them to watch it with them. The TV miniseries is the very definition of a cult hit: not a massive success at the time, but something that’s outlasted almost any other adaptation of King’s work (aside from the aforementioned Kubrick adaptation). And that’s because of Pennywise.The performance transcended the medium, let’s be honest. While I think not many would say that it’s Curry’s finest moment (because that’s clearly Wadsworth the Butler in Clue), it could be argued that it’s his role with the largest impact on nostalgic pop culture – even above Rocky Horror. Still, to this day, people dress as his Pennywise for Halloween parties his jovial form has become the shorthand for Scary Clown in generic fancy dress shop costume rentals. And when the 2017 movie of It was announced, it was the casting of Pennywise that people concentrated on because, how do you follow Curry? How do you reinvent something that, over time, became so iconic?The answer is, you don’t. You change it. In Bill Skarsgard’s performance, you get a very different sort of clown: less terrible old-timey Brooklyn accent, more unnervingly juddery Victoriana ghoul. Scary to kids coming to It for the first time now perhaps less so to those of us reared on Curry’s vamping.Watching the It miniseries now, it’s somewhat shocking to me: how short it actually is, running only 20 minutes longer in total than It: Chapter 2 how horrifyingly 1980s some of the costumesmusicperformances are how clunky some of the writing is, and how soapy many of the performances are. But perhaps I’m ill-equipped to judge. Because I still love it. I love the sense of camp it has, and I love the terrible moments where Pennywise tells jokes that I didn’t understand when I was a teenager, and aren’t funny to me now. I even sort of love the crap effects: the shot where Pennywise appears in the moon is genuinely atrocious, and the less said about the spider the better.But most of all, I love Curry’s Pennywise. I love how innocuous he is, at first. How unsettling his performance is: when he’s being jolly in luring Georgie to the sewer, there’s something of the serial killer to him, rather than the immortal creature from the deadlights. This sense of him understanding how to get his prey, how to make them come to him how to break them down without resorting to modern horror jump scares, but by using their own neuroses and fears. In the novel, King used Pennywise as the last in a line of classic horror story creatures, and in Curry’s performance, that came to life: he’s terrifying in a way that feels absolutely original, and absolutely earned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab318ed1b168ba1c748ad4ce4b2a0b18115aaa41/0_37_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df4af7b9b0f9472fd6a5f567de2de881","title":"hurricane dorian us un bahamas","story":"Thousands left without shelter and likely to face food and water shortages as Bahamas hurricane tracks towards FloridaUS officials and counterparts around the world sent out an urgent call for help for the Bahamas after the northernmost islands in the archipelago were pulverized by Hurricane Dorian.Thousands of residents of Grand Bahama and Abaco islands are without shelter, stranded by flooding and are likely to suffer shortages of food, water and medicine that will worsen without quick action by the international community, according to coordinated messages from the United Nations, the US state department, the US embassy in Nassau and local officials.“We are in the midst of a historic tragedy,” said the Bahamian prime minister, Hubert Minnis. “The devastation is unprecedented and extensive.”The dimensions of the humanitarian disaster began to emerge after the slow-moving storm, which took about 36 hours to cross the five-mile-wide Grand Bahama, finally left the country on Tuesday afternoon.Minnis announced late in the evening that the death toll had risen to seven, with more deaths expected, and predicted that rebuilding would require “a massive, coordinated effort”.“We are in the midst of one of the greatest national crises in our country’s history,” Minnis told a news conference. “No effort or resources will be held back.”The storm hit Abaco island on Sunday as a category 5 hurricane with wind gusts of up to 220mph – making it the strongest Atlantic storm ever to make landfall, tied with the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.In a country accustomed to harrowing encounters with fierce storms, Dorian registered as a disaster on another scale.“Dorian will not really move away,” said a tweet from the newspaper in Freeport, the main city on Grand Bahama, on Tuesday morning. “Heavy rain. This hurricane will totally destroy this island.”The terrible consequences were visible from the first helicopter overflights of Abaco and Grand Bahama islands on Tuesday. Video footage showed lakes of seawater instead of streets, blasted debris where homes once stood, boats thrown inland like discarded bath toys, denuded trees and the occasional lone structure still standing. In many areas, life on the islands appeared to have simply been erased.“It’s total devastation. It’s decimated. Apocalyptic. It looks like a bomb went off,” Lia Head-Rigby, who helps run a local hurricane relief organization, told the Associated Press. “It’s not rebuilding something that was there we have to start again.”Emergency access was threatened by flooding at the Freeport international airport, where runways lay under 6ft of water. The main Freeport hospital was likewise flooded, and an estimated 13,000 homes destroyed.Flooding drove residents on to roofs, water lapping over second-story windowsills and water driving against shuddering glass. There was waist-deep water in the streets and higher, which residents were struggling to swim or wade through to safety.Freeport is about 70 miles east of West Palm Beach, Florida, and is a popular cruise ship and tourist destination boasting upwards of 1 million visitors a year.“Our prayers are with our Bahamian friends as they confront the aftermath of Hurricane #Dorian,” tweeted the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. The USAID relief agency put out a call for “urgently-needed humanitarian assistance”.The US coast guard has airlifted at least 21 people injured on Abaco Island. Marvin Dames, the Bahamas’ minister of national security, said that more casualties were expected.“This was a crisis of epic proportions,” he told reporters. “The reality of it all is, unfortunately, we will see more deaths. I can’t see any way out of it.”One radio station said it had received more than 2,000 distress messages, the Associated Press reported, including reports of a five-month-old baby stranded on a roof and a woman with six grandchildren who cut a hole in a roof to escape rising floodwaters. At least two designated storm shelters flooded.Queen Elizabeth sent a message of support for the country, which gained independence in 1973.“At this very difficult time, my thoughts and prayers are with those who have seen their homes and property destroyed, and I also send my gratitude to the emergency services and volunteers who are supporting the rescue and recovery effort,” the message said.Abaco and Grand Bahama have a combined population of about 70,000 and have peak elevations of no more than 40ft above sea level.“What we are hearing lends credence to the fact that this has been a catastrophic storm and a catastrophic impact,” Cochrane said.Lawson Bates, a staffer for Arkansas-based MedicCorps, flew over Abaco and said: “It looks completely flattened. There’s boats way inland that are flipped over. It’s total devastation.”The storm caused flooding on other Bahamian islands as well, including in the capital of Nassau.The US coast guard, USAID relief agency and UN relief agencies joined efforts led by the Royal Bahamas Defense Force and the National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) of the Bahamas.The US embassy in Nassau advised those in need of urgent assistance to call Nema at 322-6731 and send their locations to +1 (242) 557-5202 via WhatsApp. Officials advised those outside the Bahamas wishing to provide assistance to visit the Center for International Disaster Information.Speaking on a cellphone video shot from the heart of the disaster, the Bahamian member of parliament Iram Lewis sent a plea for assistance.“We are going to need a lot, a lot of support after this hurricane is over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14089c7542ac2a118f7400421ebd185c5859cd17/0_149_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e091b5f03cff8f4eff34b6c849c5bb9","title":"m5s members vote overwhelmingly in favour italy coalition","story":"Online poll gives final backing for government pact with centre-left Democratic partyMembers of Italy’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) have overwhelmingly backed a coalition with the centre-left Democratic party (PD) in an online vote, giving the final backing to a deal between traditional foes intended to pull Italy out of a political crisis.The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, had been tasked with securing a pact between the two parties after Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League, collapsed its coalition with M5S in an attempt to force snap elections in which he hoped to capitalise on his recent popularity.M5S, which largely built itself online, required its members to endorse the coalition through a vote on the party’s Rousseau website.The M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, said he believed the political crisis was now over.The parties on Tuesday published a 26-point programme that would underpin the planned government. At the top of the list was a commitment to use the forthcoming budget to help stimulate economic growth, but also a promise that it would not endanger public finances.Italy has the second-largest debt burden in the EU as a proportion of economic output, and the pact called for greater flexibility from Brussels to overcome the “excessive rigidity” of existing budget rules.Emphasising social justice, the two parties pledged to introduce a minimum salary, avoid a planned VAT sales rise and boost spending on education, research and welfare. The programme also called for a web tax on multinationals and the creation of a public bank to help boost development in the south.Some M5S figures had criticised the decision to put the coalition plan to an online vote and risk a rejection.“The voting on the platform is not, in this delicate moment, the most appropriate tool, given the timing,” the MP Michele Nitti wrote on Facebook. “I am surprised the decision to do so was taken, despite the concerns that emerged after the last meeting with the colleagues of the movement.”In a statement to the Italian news agency Adnkronos a few days ago, another M5S MP, Flora Frate, asked Di Maio to withdraw the vote on Rousseau because “binding Mr Conte via the result of a vote on a platform run by a private company, without any guarantee of transparency, is absurd”.Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Luiss University in Rome, said: “The vote on Rousseau is part of the M5S tradition and was presented as an example of direct democracy, even though it is far from it.“Submitting the agreement between PD and M5S to the vote seems an affront to the institutions and to the same democratic representation, after President Mattarella formally commissioned Conte to find an agreement to form a new government.”Web-based direct democracy has been one of M5S’s core principles since it was founded in 2009 by the comedian Beppe Grillo and Gianroberto Casaleggio, an entrepreneur who died three years ago.In its early years, the movement used its website and Grillo’s blog to debate and hold votes before Rousseau, a purpose-built platform named after the 18th-century Swiss-born philosopher, was developed and introduced in 2016.But the system has been plagued by hacking attacks during key votes, and in April Italy’s data protection authority fined the company that runs the platform €50,000 (£45,000) for failing to protect users’ personal details.M5S has held dozens of online votes on key decisions, including one to elect Di Maio and another on whether to enter its previous coalition with the League. The most recent online ballot was on whether to vote in parliament to defend Salvini from prosecution for preventing migrants disembarking from an Italian coastguard ship.Italy was plunged into chaos last month when Salvini withdrew the League from its fractious alliance with M5S, as he sought to exploit his party’s popularity to bring about snap elections and become prime minister.The dramatic move threatened to create a fully formed far-right government. But Salvini, whose tactics have dented his popularity in recent weeks, had not banked on M5S teaming up with the PD. Though the two parties are longstanding enemies, they are also the two largest parties in parliament.The future of the new coalition remains uncertain. “It is a government that is surely favoured by Brussels,” said Panarari, “but in order to carry out the programme it will need to govern until 2022. So far, this seems very difficult.”Conte is expected to draw up a list of ministers by Friday. By this time next week, the new government could already be settled in Rome, with Salvini forced to watch from the opposition benches."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbaa9fa2307998d56eb6a21c4ee652065bcd1280/0_185_4143_2486/master/4143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d9af720378fffcb1cf90456f45ae625","title":"spanish pm unveils progressive policies to head off snap election","story":"Pedro Sánchez hopes to win over anti-austerity alliance and end political impasseSpain’s acting prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has announced hundreds of progressive policies intended to persuade the anti-austerity Unidas Podemos alliance to back his efforts to form a government and avoid the country’s fourth general election in as many years.Sánchez’s Socialist party (PSOE) won the most seats in April’s general election but fell short of a majority in congress and has refused to govern in coalition with the far-left grouping.Sánchez has instead suggested a “shared progressive programme” designed to end the standoff and win over Unidas Podemos, unveiling on Tuesday 370 policies including proposals to clamp down on excessive rent rises, introduce low-emission zones in towns and cities, and expand free public nursery education.Speaking at the launch in Madrid, the acting prime minister called for a government built around a “shared, progressive agreement” and an openness to society.“It’s not just because it’s the route people called for when they voted at the polls,” he said. “It’s because society is asking us to show we can overcome the political impasse that the country’s endured since 28 April and give Spain the opportunity to have a progressive government right now.”Voter anger over economic woes and corruptions scandals leaders to a hung parliament. The two main parties - the ruling People’s party (PP) and the Socialists (PSOE) - suffer big loses at the expense of newcomers (leftwing) Podemos and (rightwing) Ciudadanos. Neither the PP nor the PSOE manage to secure a majority in parliament to form a new government, so …… another election is held in June. Voter turnout is the lowest since the transition to democracy in 1975. The PP’s vote share increases, but parliamentary deadlock continues. PSOE leader Pedro Sánchez refuses to allow PP leader Mariano Rajoy to form a minority government, citing the corruption scandals swirling around the PP.Years of simmering discontent among PSOE members with Sánchez\u0026nbspboil over and he is ousted as leader after powerful factions rebel against his refusal to allow Rajoy to form a government.With Sánchez gone, the political paralysis is broken and Rajoy returns as PM after the PSOE abstains on an investiture vote in parliament.Sánchez regains the leadership of the still-ided PSOE, his hardline anti-Rajoy stance bolstered by a slew of corruption scandals involving former senior PP figures in Madrid’s regional government.Rajoy becomes the first serving Spanish PM to testify in a criminal case. He emphatically denied any knowledge of an illegal funding racket in the PP.The president of Madrid’s regional government, PP\u0027s Cristina Cifuentes, resigns after video footage emerged of her apparently being caught stealing two tubs of face cream seven years previously. Rajoy had refused to heed calls to sack Cifuentes after an earlier scandal involving false claims about her academic qualifications.The PSOE calls a vote of no confidence in the scandal-plagued Rajoy administration, and it passes through parliament with the help of regional parties and Podemos. Sánchez is sworn in as PM the next day.\u0026nbspSánchez is unable to get his 2019 budget passed through parliament after the Basque and Catalan nationalist parties who had supported him against Rajoy vote against it. Yet another election is called.Another inconclusive election sees the PSOE increases its vote share, as the PP vote plummets and the far-right Vox party enters parliament for the first time.\u0026nbsp Speculation immediately turns to how the\u0026nbspPSOE will secure the majority needed to form a government.\u0026nbspSánchez also took aim at the conservatives and pro-independence Catalan parties who overcame their bitter enmity to trigger the snap election by rejecting his government’s 2019 budget.“We haven’t got to where we are today because of disagreements between progressive parties but because pro-independence and conservative parties pooled their votes to topple a progressive government,” he said.Iglesias gave the policies a cautious welcome, telling Spanish TV that while they “sounded good”, he and his colleagues would need to study them in detail before making any decisions.Even if Sánchez manages to win over Unidas Podemos – which is far from certain – he would still need the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party to abstain during the investiture vote.Tensions between Catalan separatists and pro-unity parties remain high and are likely to rise still further when the supreme court delivers its verdict next month in the trial of the 12 regional independence leaders accused of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds over their alleged roles in the failed bid to secede from Spain two years ago.The Spanish Socialist Workers’ party\u0026nbsp has governed Spain since\u0026nbspturfing the conservative People’s party out of office last year in a vote of no-confidence. But it has struggled to achieve its ambitious agenda as it is a minority government, holding only 84 of the 350 seats in the Spanish congress. Opponents accuse it of being weak and beholden to the Catalan separatists parties on whose support it relied to win power.The rightwing party governed from 2011 until last year, when it was finally undone after a court case laid bare the corruption at its heart. In the case,\u0026nbspMariano Rajoy became the first serving PM to testify in a criminal case. He was succeeded as party leader by Pablo Casado, who has dragged the party much further to the right in the hope of seeing off the challenge from Vox.Along with Podemos, the young, the centre-right Citizens party achieved a breakthrough in the 2015 election, ending decades of PSOE and PP duopoly. The party has also shifted further to the right in recent months, and made the Catalan crisis a key focus. Its tough line on regional independence and rigorous defence of Spain’s national unity paid off in the 2017 Catalan regional elections, in which Citizens were the single biggest winner.\u0026nbspThe anti-austerity party, born of frustration and the indignados movement, looked set to leapfrog the PSOE and become the dominant leftwing political force in the 2016 general election. But mixed messages, internal squabbles and an alliance with the United Left – a coalition that includes the Communist party – saw it do far worse than expected. Podemos has helped to shore up the Sánchez government, but public internal spats have blunted its message and weakened its image.Vox, led by the pistol-carrying Santiago Abascal, ended four decades of Spanish exceptionalism in December when its performance in the Andalucían elections made it the first far-right party to win seats in Spain since the country’s return to democracy following the Franco dictatorship. Abascal has talked of a \u0027reconquest\u0027 of Spain – a reference to the long campaign against Moorish rule, which concluded in 1492 and also led to the expulsion of Spain’s Jews. Vox, which was formed by disgruntled PP members five years ago, has raged against \u0027supremacist feminism and gender totalitarianism\u0027, and the party has complained that existing domestic violence laws are unfairly weighted against men.If the manoeuvring and horse-trading fail to yield a government by 23 September, another general election will be held on 10 November.Although Spaniards are weary after voting in three general elections since December 2015, two recent polls suggest a repeat poll would benefit the PSOE.A survey for El Mundo found that the Socialists would again finish first, taking 145 of the 350 seats in congress – 22 more than they managed in April. Unidas Podemos, meanwhile, would win 40 seats, meaning the two parties would easily secure a majority.Another poll, for El Español, predicted the PSOE and Unidas Podemos would take 176 seats between them.The current impasse, however, does not bode well for a deal, and voter fatigue could cause a decrease in turnout.Sánchez came to power in June 2018 after using a vote of no confidence to turf the scandal-mired conservative People’s party (PP) out of office. The PP suffered its worst ever results in April’s election as its support collapsed and it lost 71 seats.The party’s corruption woes show no sign of abating. On Monday, a judge investigating illegal political financing summoned two former PP presidents of the Madrid region – Esperanza Aguirre and Cristina Cifuentes – to answer questions over alleged corruption.Another election could also hurt the centre-right Citizens party. The party, led by Albert Rivera, was leading the polls last year until it refused to back Sánchez’s no-confidence motion.Its liberal credentials have also been undermined by its decision to enlist the help of the far-right Vox party to take power in Andalucía and Madrid.El País’s poll predicts Citizens would drop from 57 seats to 34 in the event of another election, while El Español’s suggests it would lose 19 seats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ccfac7977987190eed76ae244f306700ec649b3/0_165_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=980e89b6110545c60dd5ff09c270860d","title":"us afghanistan troop withdrawal peace ambassadors","story":"The majority of America’s ambassadors to Afghanistan since the removal of the Taliban government have condemned the US approach to negotiating a troop withdrawal, warning it risked a return to “total civil war”.Writing the day after a draft agreement was announced, the nine men, including a former deputy secretary of state, said they supported peace talks in Afghanistan.But they warned the current approach risks spawning more violence and insecurity, because negotiators have cut the Afghan government out of discussions and have planned the departure of US troops before sealing a full peace agreement.“We believe that US security and values, including support for women, require that a full troop withdrawal come only after a real peace,” said the open letter, published by the Atlantic Council.“We must not yank so much support from our Afghan friends that they are unable to protect themselves or the chance to keep moving forward with a representative democracy.”Adding to the political turmoil in Afghanistan, a presidential election is set for 28 September. It has been unclear if the election would go ahead, but the letter warned against the suggestion that the polling should be delayed if a deal with the US paves the way for inter-Afghan talks.“Afghans deserve to determine their government and who will represent them in peace negotiations. For this to happen, there is a strong argument that presidential elections planned for September should go forward,” the ambassadors wrote.Between them, the signatories have 12 years of experience at the US embassy in Kabul over the past two decades. They also include John Negroponte, the former deputy secretary of state and the first ever US director of national intelligence.Only four ambassadors from the period since the 911 attacks and the subsequent US-backed removal of the Taliban government are missing from the list of signatories. One of them is the incumbent, and the other is the lead US envoy to peace talks, Zalmay Khalilzad.After a year of negotiations, Khalilzad has reached a draft deal with the Taliban for a US troop withdrawal. But Afghan officials were excluded from the talks, and the draft deal was only shown to President Ashraf Ghani this week.That decision, driven by the Taliban’s refusal to speak to officials they denounce as “puppets”, was unwise and damaging to the Afghan government, the ambassadors said. “Whether or not the United States wants or is willing to keep some forces engaged, we should not undercut the legitimate government in Afghanistan by keeping them out of negotiations.”The draft withdrawal deal also does not define how Afghanistan should be governed once American troops have gone. Critics say that could set the stage for an intensified civil war.Although US support has been critical to Afghan security forces, they are still several hundred thousand strong and backed up by militia which have been fighting the Taliban since before US troops first arrived. Most are likely to have a strong incentive to keep on fighting.“There is an outcome far worse than the status quo, namely a return to the total civil war that consumed Afghanistan as badly as the war with the Russians, and something that could follow a breakdown in negotiations if we remove too much support from the Afghan state,” the letter said. “If the state totters, those with nasty memories of life under the Taliban will fight on.”The deal would allow for an initial drawdown of nearly 5,000 US troops. In an interview with Afghanistan’s Tolo TV, Khalilzad declined to stay how long the remaining 8,500 troops could stay, but previous reports have suggested it would be well under two years.In return, the Taliban will guarantee that the country will not be used by al-Qaida or other extremist groups as a base for attacks on the west. Critics question how that will be enforced if the US no longer has a military presence on the ground.The agreement must be approved by Donald Trump before it can be signed, but the president has made little secret of his desire to extricate the US from its longest war as soon as possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90326f354634e16c4ba5393d86c04774ec861406/0_134_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3338f28c514d34597cff5c95c8e172a","title":"smile to pay chinese shoppers turn to facial payment technology","story":"New technology is rolling out across the country, despite concerns over privacyChina’s shoppers are increasingly purchasing goods with just a turn of their heads as the country embraces facial payment technology.In a country where mobile payment is already one of the most advanced in the world, customers can make a purchase simply by posing in front of point-of-sale (POS) machines equipped with cameras, after linking an image of their face to a digital payment system or bank account.“I don’t even have to bring a mobile phone with me, I can go out and do shopping without taking anything,” says Bo Hu, chief information officer of Wedome bakery, which uses facial payment machines across hundreds of stores.“This was not possible either at the earliest stage of mobile payment – only after the birth of facial recognition technology can we complete the payment without anything else,” he explains.The software is already widely used, often to monitor citizens. But authorities have come under fire for using it to crack down and monitor dissent, particularly in the surveillance-heavy region of Xinjiang.“There’s a big risk ... that the state could use this data for their own purposes, such as surveillance, monitoring, the tracking of political dissidents, social and information control, ethnic profiling, as in the case with Uighurs in Xinjiang, and even predictive policing,” says Adam Ni, China researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney.“This is certainly one of the more contentious aspects of the gathering of facial recognition data and the usage of them.”Despite the concerns over data security and privacy, many consumers seem unperturbed by facial recognition payment in the high street.Alipay – the financial arm of ecommerce giant Alibaba – has been leading the charge in China with devices already in 100 cities.The firm is predicting enormous growth in the sector and recently launched an upgrade of its “Smile-to-Pay” system, using a machine roughly the size of an iPad.Alipay will spend three billion yuan ($420m) over three years on implementing the technology.Tencent, which runs the WeChat app with 600 million users, unveiled its new facial payment machine called “Frog Pro” in August, while a growing number of start-ups are trying to tap into the burgeoning industry.“(Facial payment) certainly has the potential to become popular with the wide push from major mobile payment players,” says Mengmeng Zhang, an analyst at Counterpoint.“Alipay is spending (billions) to popularise facial payment technology through giving out subsidies for vendors and rewards for consumers that use facial payment,” she adds.At the IFuree self-service supermarket in Tianjin, a 3D camera scans the faces of those entering the store – measuring width, height and depth of the faces – then another quick scan again at check-out.“It’s convenient because you can buy things very quickly,” says retiree Zhang Liming after using facial payment for her groceries.“It’s different from the payment in the traditional supermarket, in which you have to wait in the checkout line and it’s very troublesome,” she argues.Bo Hu says 300 of his bakeries have facial payment systems, and he plans to introduce them in 400 more.He believes it makes the checkout process more efficient, but concedes the numbers using the new technology are still modest.Supporters of the technology wave aside privacy concerns.“The facial recognition technology helps to protect our privacy,” explains IFuree engineer Li Dongliang.“In the traditional way, it’s very dangerous to enter the password if someone stands beside you. Now we can complete the payment with our faces, which helps us secure our account,” he insists.But for many consumers, it is vanity rather than privacy that puts them off using such systems.In response Alipay pledged to introduce “beautifying filters” into all the Alipay cameras."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea87bd94bcfc1be930d51954c555e91558ae2d1e/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fd06540718f1c806a71469d1296161a","title":"hurricane dorian hammers the bahamas in pictures","story":"Images show the extent of flooding in cities including Nassau and Dorian this week"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4006926.1567542013!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"doonbeg welcomes pence the man not the conservative s policies","story":"US vice-president Mike Pence chats with locals on walkabout of Doonbeg village with his wife, mother and sister before a family dinner.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFine Gael local election candidate Mike Taylor in Kilkee. Co Clare’s first openly gay election candidate has criticised the visit of Mike Pence to Co Clare. Photograph: Simon CarswellEven the secret service agents were taking photographs of the Atlantic waves rolling in on Doughmore beach next to Donald Trump’s golf resort at Doonbeg in west Clare.One agent was so taken with Ireland’s Atlantic coast that she thought it a stunning backdrop for a portrait of her Belgian Malinois sniffer dog outside the restaurant in the resort’s golf clubhouse.Others thought the Irish naval vessel, the LÉ William Butler Yeats – sent to Doughmore Bay to protect Trump’s deputy, US vice-president Mike Pence during his two-night visit – was worth a few snaps.Even Joe Russell, managing director of Trump’s resort, thought that Pence’s visit was “quieter” than the juggernaut that steamed through here in June when Trump and his 600-strong entourage visited. The number of US official staff in west Clare this week with Pence, or V-POTUS as he is officially known, and his wife, second lady Karen Pence, or SLOTUS, are about half that number.Russell said it was “lovely” to have a return visit from the White House so soon after Trump’s, particularly because Pence’s mother’s grandmother came from the Doonbeg area. Kieran Maloney, a distant cousin of Pence who works as a barman at Trump’s resort, served drinks to America’s second couple on Monday night in Trump’s Ocean View restaurant.SharingPence’s visit, brought forward by four days, meant his party are sharing the resort for two nights with a team-building conference for staff from a multinational logistics company and a US wedding group. One American guest, when disturbed for permission to have their room “swept” by the secret service, responded: “It would be an honour.” The party is said to be made up of the “right voters”.A member of the corporate team-building party, from Norway, said she was unable to take a stroll on the beach because of the security restrictions. “At least we are safe,” she said, generously, referring to the heavy security presence. Tom Skea from New Jersey said he did not know Pence was at Doonbeg until his golfing party arrived but they were not put out by the metal detectors and checks.“It’s Trump, you have to expect the unexpected,” he said, drinking a pint of Guinness as he surveyed the course.He expressed surprise at the number of secret service agents at the resort and the cost to the American taxpayer.“People don’t care,” said Skea, a Trump voter. “Trump has got so much money, it doesn’t matter.”The reception for Pence around here has been more low key than the welcome rolled out for Trump in June.Rita McInerney, a Fianna Fáil general election candidate who runs a cafe in Doonbeg, said, like for Trump, locals could welcome Pence the man and still be opposed to the conservative’s policies, particularly his opposition to same-sex marriage and rights for LGBT people. “Doonbeg people are no fools. They have a certain level of pride in the fact that it is a relative of someone who came from Doonbeg who has achieved high office. The fact that you may or may not disagree with their policies is a separate issue,” said McInerney who disagrees with Pence’s LGBT views.‘Regressive’Down the road in Kilkee, 2019 Fine Gael local council contender Mike Taylor, the county’s first openly gay local election candidate, felt it was “regressive and regrettable” that Pence had been welcomed in Clare.“It is sickening to me that somebody can hold such regressive, dangerous and ignorant views,” he said.He took issue with the White House’s deputy press secretary tweeting on Tuesday morning that Pence could not be described as anti-gay because he was lunching with a gay Taoiseach and his partner in Dublin later in the day.“Is that really the image we want to project across the world?” he said.Taylor (21), a member of Young Fine Gael’s engagement, inclusion and ersity committee, was equally unhappy that Varadkar found himself in a “cheap photo op” with Pence that exposed the US vice-president’s “hypocrisy”.“To see our Taoiseach willing to shake hands with that kind of person – in one sense, it shows what a diplomat and statesman Leo can be,” he said. “On the other hand, I think it shows what a fool he can be.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4006976.1567545793!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord how mike pence shat on the new carpet in ireland s spare room","story":"US vice-president Mike Pence meets Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Dublin amid controversy about his decision to stay in President Trump’s Doonbeg golf course during his visit to Ireland.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS vice president Mike Pence, Nancy Pence-Fritsch and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, An Taoiseach at Farmleigh House, where Mr Pence was  the service records of his grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley, who served with distinction in the  Defence Forces during the Civil War. Photograph: MaxwellThe hospitable hosts buttered up their important guest and made a big fuss of his family and hoped he would say nice things about them to the important people he would meet after his visit to Ireland.And he told them they were wonderful and that he loved them. He even said a special prayer for everyone and then, just before he left, he turned around and kicked them where it hurts.It came as a shock.Like pulling out all the stops for a much-anticipated visitor to your home and thinking it has been a great success until somebody discovers he shat on the new carpet in the spare room, the one you bought specially for him.US vice-president Mike Pence met President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Tuesday during an official visit. His Irish hosts, up to their oxters for the last three years in Brexit worry, hoped to impress upon him Ireland’s fears about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit for the country.He could, maybe, stick in a supportive word for us in his talks with Boris Johnson in London – his next port of call.Pence, after all, is Irish American and wastes no opportunity to go misty-eyed about his love for the “Old Country” as he lards on his Mother Machree schtick on both sides of the Atlantic. He couldn’t praise Ireland enough on Tuesday – “deeply humbled” and “honoured” to be going to the hometown of his mother’s grandmother and so on.Strong endorsementBut, after he said all these nice things about the “Emerald Isle” and how much his boss Donald Trump – he sent his best wishes, by the way – appreciates us and all we do to help American security in Shannon, he delivered a very strong endorsement of Boris Johnson and Brexit.No room left for doubt. As Pence read from the autocue and Irish eyes definitely stopped smiling, it was clear he was channeling His Master’s Voice. Trump is a fan of Brexit and of Boris.And this, after such a lovely morning, with Pence and his mother meeting the Taoiseach and his mother.His Irish mother, as Mike calls her. He dotes on Nancy. So he should have known that any Irish mammy will tell you if you can’t say anything good, say nothing at all.Instead, he veered off his rather gushing statement following his meeting with the Taoiseach into some crunching Brexit remarks about our duty to do right by Boris Johnson and the UK.As the air in the steamy ballroom turned decidedly frosty, Pence urged Ireland and the European Union “to negotiate in good faith” with the new British prime minister.The local crowd raised eyebrows and wondered what he thinks the aforementioned EU has been doing for the last three years, if not negotiating in good faith with the UK.Varadkar’s expression didn’t change. He stood on the platform beside the vice-president and hardly flinched, smiling politely.Even when Pence made it worse by not only mentioning “good faith” and “Boris Johnson” in the same context but by also requesting his hosts to have “respect for the UK’s sovereignty”, Varadkar maintained a stoic courtesy.He had to. It’s in the job description for normal prime ministers.Same goes for Higgins, even though it would be true to say that Michael D and Mike Pence do not sing from the same hymn sheet.But international diplomacy is what it is and in the context of going about their nations’ business, everyone has to be seen to get along.But for all that, Michael D’s sprayed-on smile when the US vice-president came to visit him in Áras an Uachtaráin was a joy to behold.The Áras was bedecked with flowers from the garden for the visit of the anti-gay-rights Pence. All the flowers were in shades of pink. The only other colour was lavender.Huge entouragePence arrived with a huge entourage. Higgins escorted him through the Áras and into the ballroom where he invited his guest to sign the visitors’ book. Michael D looked ahead a lot of the time. “Can I invite you to sign. . . ” he motioned towards the book.Pence sat at the table and began to write. The President stood to one side, saying nothing apart from the occasional whisper to his wife, Sabina. The VP kept writing as the silence got louder. Still writing. Michael D looking into the distance.Finally, thank God, Pence stopped writing, which was a relief all round. There was another photo opportunity then the party retired next door for tea. A picture was released of the two groups sitting on either side of a long table – two tables together.The sort of thing when more guests than expected arrive. “Quick, run out next door and ask Assumpta for the collapsible table they got in for Mossie’s wake. Your man from America is only after arriving with half of Indiana. Where’s the big tablecloth?”The talks between the President and the vice-president didn’t take long. Soon, they were waving goodbye from the portico. The dogs didn’t put in an appearance.He didn’t call the vice-president a “w*****r”, which is what he did when he had a row many years on radio with a famous American conservative commentator. Michael Graham was his name. Michael D might easily have become confused, because Mike Pence is an adherent of the “Graham rule”. This is where he doesn’t stay alone in a room with a woman who is not his wife so as not to give rise to bad thoughts and the like.Static courtesyAt Farmleigh House, Varadkar’s static courtesy was equally impressive. But then, the Taoiseach has dined before in Pence’s presence.“We are all God’s children,” Leo pointedly told him when they met for breakfast last March in Washington. Just to be clear, they met for breakfast in a roomful of other people. The two men weren’t dining alone, perish the thought.It was a very pleasant event. This was when Leo invited his American host to Ireland and told him to bring along his mother too. It would be a grand trip for her and, in an emergency, if Mike’s wife was otherwise detained, mammy could sit in as chaperone should the VP have found himself unavoidably alone in a dining room with our gay Taoiseach.You can never be too careful. In the end, Pence brought his wife, his mother and his sister to the Old Country, where it seems a lot of the natives have turned alarmingly heathen in the generations since his ancestors left our shores.His morning began with a trip to the Phoenix Park and a courtesy call on the President.To look at Mike Pence, with all smiles and handshakes, you’d hardly think he isn’t very keen on the gays at all.Brave Mike sat down to lunch with the Taoiseach and his partner Matthew and managed not to choke on his Dublin Bay prawns. The VP’s wife Karen, who recently took up a part-time teaching position in a school which bans LGBT pupils and staff, kept her fillets of venison down despite the company.The next prime minister the couple will meet on their trip will be the serial philander Boris Johnson. He’s pretty experienced on the extramarital and premarital sex front, which they abhor.On Tuesday, to be on the safe side, nobody was left alone with the US vice-president in case it might upset him.“We have both been blessed with Irish mothers,” Pence told the Taoiseach when they met the press. He didn’t say anything about Indian fathers (in Leo’s case) but there you go.“I carry Ireland with me wherever I go,” said Pence, speaking of an old Ireland, one his ancestors left generations ago.Still, his visit was a great example of ersity in action. President Trump, who recently visited, is very hands-on with women and likes to grab them in all sorts of places. And his second in command is the opposite. He won’t stay on his own with a woman who isn’t his wife."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4007384.1567579310!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"jacob rees mogg criticised for lounging languidly during brexit debate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg reclining on his seat in the House of Commons London. Photograph: PABritish parliamentarians have criticised Jacob Rees-Mogg for “lounging languidly” along the front bench during the historic Brexit debate on Tuesday.The Leader of the House was seen reclining in the chamber, at times with his eyes closed, as MPs discussed plans to take control of the Commons agenda and pass legislation which would prevent a no-deal Brexit on October 31st.Green Party MP Caroline Lucas told Mr Rees-Mogg his body language was “so contemptuous of this House and of the people”.Addressing him in the Commons, Ms Lucas added: “For the benefit of Hansard, the Leader of the House has been spread across around three seats, lying out as if that was something very boring for him to listen to tonight.”Mr Rees-Mogg appeared to furrow his brow in disagreement in response.As he laid back, Mr Rees-Mogg could be seen pressing his head against a speaker, a tactic often used by MPs attempting to more clearly hear debates in the chamber.His apparent repose prompted heavy criticism on Twitter from political opponents.Labour MP, Karl Turner, tweeted: “As a working class bloke brought up on a council estate in Hull I always feel enormous pride and gratitude when I go into the chamber of the House of Commons to represent east Hull.“I’ve never felt a sense of entitlement. This is what that looks like!?”SNP MP Gavin Newlands added: “Jacob Rees-Mogg is literally going for a (u)kip on the front bench. I just asked him if I should call his footman to get him a pillow. He politely declined.”Lib Dem MP Sarah Wollaston questioned if Mr Rees-Mogg had “lost the ability to sit up” or if the move was “just bad manners”.Angela Rayner, shadow secretary of state for education said: “I am half expecting his nanny to march into the chamber with a blanket, pillow and a hot cup of Horlicks for the poor man!”Chi Onwurah, Labour MP for Newcastle Central and shadow minister for industrial strategy, tweeted that MPs needed to “take back control”.She said: “Johnson, Rees-Mogg and their ilk literally think Parliament is their manor and they can do what they like with it.”The MP’s horizontal pose also prompted some more light-hearted responses.Labour Lord Stewart Wood joked that the pose resembled the cover for David Bowie’s album The Man Who Sold The World, while journalist Ash Percival referenced a famous scene featuring Kate Winslet in the film Titanic by tweeting the picture with the words: “Paint me like one of your French girls”. - PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

With Google Play system updates, important Security and Privacy fixes can now be sent directly to your phone from Google Play, just the same way all your other apps update. So you get these fixes as soon as they are available.As part of the new update Google also introduced dark mode - a highly-anticipated feature among Android users in recent years.The new Dark theme is designed to take it easy on your eyes when using a smartphone in low-light conditions. Google claims it will also help prolong a device\u0027s battery life.Other new features in a sound amplifier to boost sound and filter out background noise, as well as gesture navigation to move between apps using swipes.This last feature means the back button, which has been a staple of\u0026nbspAndroid operating systems in recent years, has now been removed.Instead users will need to learn how to get around with a swipe and a pull. Google claims this new system is designed to be quicker and more intuitive, though it is already proving controversial among Android users.Finally, Android 10 comes with support for folding phones, meaning its interface can seamlessly transition between different screen shapes.Both Samsung and Huawei plan to release folding smartphones later this year in the form of the Galaxy Fold and the Mate X, though their launch has been delayed due to issues with the mechanism.Their delayed launch means they could come already shipped with the new operating system.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Other major cryptocurrencies also experienced a price boost, including ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash.A 6 per cent rise against the US dollar amounted to nearly 10 per cent of gains against the pound after turmoil surrounding Brexit sent the UK currency into free-fall. Market analysts have previously predicted that bitcoin will reach record highs if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal.Economic turmoil in Argentina, combined with an escalating trade war between the US and China, also helped to bolster bitcoin’s price, according to\u0026nbspMarcus\u0026nbspSwanepoel, CEO of cryptocurrency firm\u0026nbspLuno.“After lacklustre trading over the weekend, bitcoin went against the market trend yesterday, quickly breaking through the $10,000 level and reaching $10,500,” Swanepoel told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“Today the focus will be on Europe and the Brexit developments in the UK, as well as the deepening crisis in Argentina.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThe UK is set to leave Europe on 31 October, 2019, though this date could be delayed if parliament votes to block the possibility of a no-deal exit.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he plans to take the UK out of Europe in time for the Brexit deadline, with or without a deal.\u0026nbspIf plans to block a no deal are passed then Johnson will likely call for a general election before the Brexit deadline.Such uncertainty has seen the pound fall to its lowest level against the US dollar since January 2017.\u0026nbspNeil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets, said: “The outlook for sterling may well worsen if there is an election and will certainly deteriorate if it’s a no deal.”CoinMarketCap)The price of bitcoin is notoriously volatile but has seen a steady increase in its price throughout 2019. It has nearly trebled in price since the start of the year but still remains a long way of its record price of close to $20,000, which it hit in late 2017.The prospect of an economically damaging Brexit, together with increased trade tariffs between the world’s two largest economies, has helped contribute to bitcoin’s resurgent price.China’s state-backed cryptocurrency could displace banksSome investors are even beginning to see the cryptocurrency as a safe-haven asset, similar to gold.This is thanks to its finite supply – only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist – and the fact it relies on a borderless and decentralised infrastructure that is less prone to the effects of a single country or market.Nicholas Gregory, CEO of blockchain firm CommerceBlock, recently told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspthat bitcoin had “rediscovered its mojo” in 2019 thanks to an increasingly unstable global economy.“A no-deal Brexit could see a massive and unprecedented breakout,” he said.“Not only will a no-deal departure from the EU create turmoil and volatility across two major fiat currencies, it will also trigger an identity crisis for the global system as the contingency and vulnerability of major global fiat currencies is laid bare.”\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The statement effectively says: Mr Gove your pants are well and truly on fire. You might struggle to get replacements given the mess you and your colleagues propose to create at UK ports, too.\u0026nbspNow, trade bodies exist to lobby for their industries. Part of that involves them making noise, and providing cover for their members by saying things they are reluctant to say themselves.\u0026nbspBut their statements tend to be tempered by the fact that they also like to maintain good relationships with government for the purposes of doing the all-important behind-the-scenes business.\u0026nbspWhat prompted the BRC to more or less abandon this and take the gloves off in such a fierce manner?\u0026nbspUK retail sales fall sharply, adding to recession fearsRetail sales over past year weakest on record, survey showsUK retail sales slide for third consecutive month in July – CBI surveyPartly it was born of frustration.\u0026nbspThe BRC has done a lot of work on the impact of no deal across the retail industry, with a view to assisting its members who will have to deal with it. Needless to say, it doesn’t like what it sees. It doesn’t like it at all.\u0026nbspThe work has been hampered by a huge number of unknowns faced by its members. What will the tariff schedule for goods coming in ultimately look like? How long will the delays at customs be? Will hauliers be willing to send trucks to the UK during the initial chaos when it might pay them to look for work elsewhere?\u0026nbspOctober is a particularly bad time for this to occur for food retailers because there are lots of things the UK can’t grow in the autumn. If you want tomatoes, you’d best get your tins in.\u0026nbspThere is also an issue with EU migrant labour. Workers from this pool pack and clean incoming produce. We now know that free movement won’t end on 31 October\u0026nbspafter all. But will that labour hang around, given the growing list of problems with the “settled status” created for them?The problem that organisations like the BRC face is that raising issues like these ones with government isn’t getting them\u0026nbspanywhere, either in public or behind the scenes.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson’s administration isn’t listening to anyone other than its own extremists. It it is playing a deadly game of poker with the British people and British business. Governing doesn’t seem to matter to it.\u0026nbspThere is one final calculation at work in the BRC getting its punches in now: the blame game. The statement confers upon the BRC the right to say: “See, we told you so. We raised all these issues, we did the work and yet you ignored us.”Johnson and co will do their utmost to try to deflect being called to account for their actions in the aftermath of a no-deal outcome. Some £100m is being splurged on the “get ready” campaign with that in mind. The intention seems to be for ministers to claim that they warned business but weren’t listened to. The BRC’s statement makes clear that this won’t wash. Retailers have already done their utmost. They’re still at it. They are stockpiling where they can. They are working with their suppliers. They have carefully reviewed their supply chains.\u0026nbspThey have, in other words, done everything they can given the unknowns they face.\u0026nbspHowever much Mr Gove and his colleagues twist and turn, any shortages, any foul-ups, will be on them and them alone.\u0026nbspAnd they must be called to account.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anything below 50 indicates that the sector is contracting. Similar figures for construction and the UK’s dominant services sector\u0026nbspwill follow later this week.\u0026nbspTo put it in context, these are the worst numbers in seven years.PMI survey reveals biggest slide in UK construction output since 2009UK manufacturing suffers sharpest contraction in over six years – PMIServices growth falls for first time since September The assumption in the City was that, with Britain’s car plants having ended the temporary shutdowns imposed ahead of the last no deal Brexit cliff edge in the Spring, there would be a modest improvement. That it hasn’t happened looks ominous.\u0026nbspBut, but, but look at Germany, tends to be the stock response of Brexiteers when confronted with figures like this. This is a cynical attempt to deflect attention from the problems they have created and the damage they are doing to the economy.\u0026nbspIt is, however, quite true that the figures were also\u0026nbspimpact by a generally chilly economic climate.The global \u0026nbsppicture is not a pretty one\u0026nbspand it is affecting manufacturers across the Western world including, yes, Germany.\u0026nbspBut I would draw your attention to a very good point in response to the figures\u0026nbspmade by Simon French, the chief economist at broker Panmure Gordon.\u0026nbspHe says that while it is true that the 7-year low in UK manufacturing is generally in line with the (weak) global picture, EU and Chinese PMI numbers have started to stabilise in stark contrast to the UK (and the US) which are still trending downwards.\u0026nbspIn economics, the trend is just as important as the bare numbersWhich, of course, brings us to back Brexit, and the uncertainty it is wreaking. It inevitably serves to make a shaky global situation worse for British industry and the people who work in it. Behind the numbers are real people with real livelihoods which are under threat. That should not be forgotten.Created with Sketch.

It takes two of these in a row to tick that particular boxAt\u0026nbspthe moment, it’s a little early to be speculating.

Sterling has tumbled almost 19 per cent since the EU referendum in June 2016.The government’s defeat by a margin of 328 to 301 on Tuesday leaves Mr Johnson’s Brexit strategy in tatters by potentially robbing him of the threat of no-deal, which he has repeatedly said is essential to obtain concessions from the EU.Responding from the despatch box immediately after the result, the prime minister said he would table a bill to trigger a general election, with a vote expected to take place soon after the anti-no deal bill completes its passage through the Commons on Wednesday.But Mr Johnson’s plans seemed doomed to failure after Labour said it would not back his election motion, which requires a two-thirds majority and is therefore dependent on opposition support to pass through the Commons, until the legislation to stop no-deal is passed.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Canadian site, which employees nearly 300 people,\u0026nbspis to\u0026nbspbe bought by Japanese firm JFE Shoji. The smaller Swedish plant, which has 100 staff and manufactures advanced steel for electrical vehicles,\u0026nbspis to be retained by Tata.But the company said its Newport factory had been “loss-making for several years” as it struggled to compete in a fast-moving market “in which customer requirements have outstripped the site’s capability”. Converting the factory to produce steel for electrical vehicles would cost more than £50m, Tata added.An\u0026nbspengineering steels service centre in Wolverhampton is also set\u0026nbspto close after Tata was unable to find a buyer. Up to 26 jobs are at risk, including at a sales office in Bolton.British Steel subsidiary sold to French firm, protecting 400 jobsSteelworkers trade union Community called the closures “devastating” and urged the government to intervene. Union leaders believe Tata had committed to safeguarding jobs as part of a 2017 rescue deal under which workers accepted reduced pension benefits.Roy Rickhuss, Community general secretary, said: “This is shocking news, which makes a mockery of the understanding we reached with Tata around the jobs guarantee. There has been no consultation about this proposal either at UK or European level and company management should hang their heads in shame in the way this has come about.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when the government wants to decarbonise the economy and support a switch to electric vehicles, losing the UK’s only producer of electrical steels would be a grave error.”Jessica Morden, MP for Newport East, said the closure of the plant was “tragic”. She added: “This is devastating news for the highly skilled workforce and their families. The Orb steelworks has been at the heart of Newport community since 1898.“What is particularly tragic is that this the only UK plant with the potential to produce electric steels for motors and with investment, vision and government backing this could be the key part of the supply chain for electric vehicles.”The government said the closure was “a commercial decision for Tata” but it would remain “in regular contact with the company, unions and other partners throughout this process”.Last week a subsidiary of British Steel, which collapsed in May, was bought by French-owned Systra Group\u0026nbspin deal which protected 400 jobs in York.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Analysts said there was little prospect of the industry recovering in the last quarter of 2019 and September’s data was likely to be even bleaker.The UK’s manufacturing output slumped to a seven-year low last month as the sector shrank at the fastest rate since 2012, the industry’s PMI showed on Monday.Economists will be closely watching Wednesday’s data for the services sector, which accounts for about 80 per cent of UK output and posted unexpected growth in July, for an indication as to the health of the wider British economy.A poor performance\u0026nbspfor August\u0026nbspwould raise serious questions about Britain’s ability to bounce back from an overall economic contraction in the second quarter of this year. A second contraction in the current quarter would signal a recession.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Set building begins on Waterloo Place in Edinburgh ahead of filming for Fast and Furious 9Members of the Royal Southern Yacht Club and the Island Sailing Club take part during the annual cricket match between the clubs, which takes place on the Bramble Bank sandbank in the middle of the Solent at low tideAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate at Whitehall in LondonOne of the iconic \u0027Girl with Balloon\u0027 artworks by anonymous street artist Banksy is carried near one of the original locations the artwork appeared at on the Southbank in LondonThe sun rises over the sculpture The Couple by artist Sean Henry, at Newbiggin-by-the-sea in NorthumberlandA person wearing a Boris Johnson \u0027head\u0027 digs a grave at the foot of a tombstone during a protest organised by Avaaz and Best for Britain, outside Downing Street in LondonNat Lofthouse statue is covered in flags at the University of Bolton Stadium, BoltonPerformers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

This pair of galaxies is known as UGC2369 and they are being drawn together by mutual gravitational attraction.

Soon after they had been calculated to potentially crash, the satellite phoned home as usual and send down the science data it had collected, assuring engineers that the collision had been avoided.SpaceX launches Boeing-made satellite into orbitAt the moment, ESA says such manoeuvres are very rare between active satellites. For the most part, satellites have to move out of the path of dead satellites or pieces left over from previous collisions.But space agencies including ESA have repeatedly warned that megaconstellations such as those sent into space by Starlink could pose a vastly increased danger. Those constellations are projected to include thousands of satellites.When there is such a high degree of danger, it will become impossible for engineers to manually spot potential collisions and move satellites out of their way.Instead, ESA plans to make this process automatic, relying on artificial intelligence to move satellites out of danger.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sterling has tumbled almost 19 per cent since the EU referendum in June 2016.The government’s defeat by a margin of 328 to 301 on Tuesday leaves Mr Johnson’s Brexit strategy in tatters by potentially robbing him of the threat of no-deal, which he has repeatedly said is essential to obtain concessions from the EU.Responding from the despatch box immediately after the result, the prime minister said he would table a bill to trigger a general election, with a vote expected to take place soon after the anti-no deal bill completes its passage through the Commons on Wednesday.But Mr Johnson’s plans seemed doomed to failure after Labour said it would not back his election motion, which requires a two-thirds majority and is therefore dependent on opposition support to pass through the Commons, until the legislation to stop no-deal is passed.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Canadian site, which employees nearly 300 people,\u0026nbspis to\u0026nbspbe bought by Japanese firm JFE Shoji. The smaller Swedish plant, which has 100 staff and manufactures advanced steel for electrical vehicles,\u0026nbspis to be retained by Tata.But the company said its Newport factory had been “loss-making for several years” as it struggled to compete in a fast-moving market “in which customer requirements have outstripped the site’s capability”. Converting the factory to produce steel for electrical vehicles would cost more than £50m, Tata added.An\u0026nbspengineering steels service centre in Wolverhampton is also set\u0026nbspto close after Tata was unable to find a buyer. Up to 26 jobs are at risk, including at a sales office in Bolton.British Steel subsidiary sold to French firm, protecting 400 jobsSteelworkers trade union Community called the closures “devastating” and urged the government to intervene. Union leaders believe Tata had committed to safeguarding jobs as part of a 2017 rescue deal under which workers accepted reduced pension benefits.Roy Rickhuss, Community general secretary, said: “This is shocking news, which makes a mockery of the understanding we reached with Tata around the jobs guarantee. There has been no consultation about this proposal either at UK or European level and company management should hang their heads in shame in the way this has come about.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when the government wants to decarbonise the economy and support a switch to electric vehicles, losing the UK’s only producer of electrical steels would be a grave error.”Jessica Morden, MP for Newport East, said the closure of the plant was “tragic”. She added: “This is devastating news for the highly skilled workforce and their families. The Orb steelworks has been at the heart of Newport community since 1898.“What is particularly tragic is that this the only UK plant with the potential to produce electric steels for motors and with investment, vision and government backing this could be the key part of the supply chain for electric vehicles.”The government said the closure was “a commercial decision for Tata” but it would remain “in regular contact with the company, unions and other partners throughout this process”.Last week a subsidiary of British Steel, which collapsed in May, was bought by French-owned Systra Group\u0026nbspin deal which protected 400 jobs in York.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

They had one daughter together.Speaking to the New York Times while promoting\u0026nbspthe forthcoming sequel Terminator: Dark Fate, Hamilton said that the pair’s relationship “was a mystery to all of us – even Jim and myself – because we are terribly mismatched.

Sheen was forced to crawl for approximately half a mile before finding somebody who could treat him.Jackie Chan is famous for many things and performing his own stunts is one of them. This has left him with his fair share of injuries in the past, some of which came on the set of 1986 action comedy Armour of God.

I almost killed Tom Cruise.”British actor John Hurt was under so much prosthetic playing Joseph Merick in David Lynch\u0027s 1980 historical drama The Elephant Man that he almost suffocated.

In fact, he was so dedicated to the role that he reportedly refused medicine that didn\u0027t exist at the time of his character, but acquiesced when he was told by medics he could die if he didn\u0027t. Bob Denver, who played the titular Gilligan on 1960s TV series Gilligan’s Island, found himself in mortal danger after getting trapped inside a hut with a lion that pounced on him.

Fortunately, it left him with mere bruises.While filming the last ever episode of Lost in 2010, Matthew Fox - who played Jack Shephard - was almost stabbed by a knife after a retractable one was replaced by a real one. The plan was to use the real knife for a fight sequence, right up until the moment of penetration as a collapsible one looked too fake. Somehow, the knives weren\u0027t swapped and Fox was saved by protective padding he\u0027d put on at the very last minute.Dylan O\u0027Brien nearly met his maker on the set of Maze Runner: The Death Cure.

After a crew member forgot to apply the brakes to an unmanned van, the vehicle started rolling towards Thurman, who was completely unaware.

Those 007 skills certainly came in handy.As ever, Jackie Chan performed his own stunts for the first of his popular Hong King action series Police Story (1985).

He confirmed that Labour would back an early election under any circumstances if Boris Johnson were to call one.\u0026nbspWithin hours, the sounds of gears being thrown into reverse could be heard in Westminster. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, a lawyer who understands small print, realised there was a danger of the Labour Party walking into a trap designed by the prime minister.\u0026nbspThen after Tuesday night’s vote, when Johnson indicated he would call for an early election, Corbyn told him: “Get the bill through first in order to take no-deal off the table.”The Labour leader knows that a vote of parliament for an early election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act leaves the date of the election under the control of the prime minister.\u0026nbspIf the Commons votes for Hilary Benn’s bill to block a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday night, Johnson is set to ask MPs to vote for an early election immediately afterwards. He will say that he intends to hold the election on 14 October, but the Act merely requires MPs to vote, by a two-thirds majority, for a motion saying: “There shall be an early general election.”If they vote for it, it is then up to the prime minister to advise the Queen on the date of the election. It would be extraordinary for Johnson to go back on his word in parliament, but there would be nothing to stop him naming a different date. He could, for example, ask Her Majesty to issue a proclamation for an election on 7 November.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Protesters take to streets after Boris Johnson suspends Parliament  Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Anti Brexit protesters march on WhitehallMany of the protesters carried placardsThe protesters also marched to Trafalgar Square, where they blocked trafficJohn McDonnell addressed crowds in Whitehall.A small group of Brexit supporters attempted to stage a counter protest in central London.Three people were arrested in London, including a woman who sat on the road near Trafalgar Square.In Oxford, locals and students gathered outside Balliol College, Boris Johnson\u0027s alma mater, to protest.Thousands of people gather in central Glasgow to protest against the prime minister.Jeremy Corbyn spoke to protesters in central Glasgow.Anti Brexit protesters march on WhitehallMany of the protesters carried placardsThe protesters also marched to Trafalgar Square, where they blocked trafficJohn McDonnell addressed crowds in Whitehall.A small group of Brexit supporters attempted to stage a counter protest in central London.Three people were arrested in London, including a woman who sat on the road near Trafalgar Square.In Oxford, locals and students gathered outside Balliol College, Boris Johnson\u0027s alma mater, to protest.Thousands of people gather in central Glasgow to protest against the prime minister.Jeremy Corbyn spoke to protesters in central Glasgow.That would mean there would be no parliament sitting on Brexit day, 31 October, which would mean that the UK would leave the EU without a deal by automatic operation of EU law.\u0026nbspSo Labour MPs had been lobbying their leader to refuse to support the prime minister’s motion for an early election, and different Labour spokespeople have been saying different things about the party’s position.\u0026nbspTwo Labour MPs, Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle, have written for The Independent explaining why they are opposed to an early election: they say that Brexit must be decided first.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn hoping to block no-deal Brexit and trigger electionHow Jeremy Corbyn handles this week will be his legacySharon Osbourne lashes out at Jeremy Corbyn in violent, scathing rantJohnson is pushing anti-Brexit liberals into the embrace of CorbynBut I understand that Corbyn’s close advisers argued that Labour could not afford to be seen as shying away from election.

He gave two reasons: one was the danger of the election date being set after 31 October the other was that Labour would lose, making a no-deal Brexit more likely.\u0026nbspIf the shadow cabinet did urge Labour MPs to vote against an early election on Wednesday night, Johnson would not have a two-thirds majority. He may then try to pass an act amending the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, setting the 14 October date in law, which would need a simple majority to pass.\u0026nbspIf Labour MPs still refused to vote for it, they will be accused of being afraid of losing, because there would certainly be time to stop a no-deal Brexit after the election – if Corbyn won it. And the government might even win the vote with the help of the Scottish National Party, which thinks it can win back a lot of the seats it lost two years ago.\u0026nbspMuch more high politics ahead.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

Hubert Minnis, the prime minister, urged Bahamians to show love to come through the ordeal suffered by their country, while aerial video recorded over the Bahamas’ Great Abaco Island showed mile upon mile of flooded neighbourhoods and smashed buildings.In the US, meanwhile, authorities in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas were on high alert, as they watched for indications the storm may make landfall in their states.\u0026nbspEarly on Tuesday, Dorian was downgraded by a single notch to a category 2 storm, with sustained maximum winds of 125mph. At the same time, the size the hurricane covered increased, as did the speed at which it was moving.“The headline for this #Dorian advisory is NOT that the wind speed has slightly decreased,” the National Hurricane Centre said of an update\u0026nbspit issued on Twitter. “The combined wind, surge, and floods hazards are the same or even worse since the hurricane has become larger.”Created with Sketch.Huge damage as record Hurricane Dorian hits Bahamas: In pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A road is flooded during the passing of Hurricane Dorian in Freeport, Grand Bahama.Hurricane Dorian\u0027s eye taken by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague, from aboard the International Space Station.

A total of nine counties issued mandatory evacuation orders, including\u0026nbspDuval County, which includes Jacksonville, one of Florida’s two biggest cities, and some areas in Palm Beach County, home to President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.The governors of Georgia and South Carolina also ordered evacuations of some coastal counties. Forecasts suggested the storm will move northwards, hugging the coast of Georgia and potentially making landfall in either North or South Carolina by the end of Thursday. Late on Tuesday, North Carolina governor Roy Cooper also announced evacuations for his coastal residents, while recognising the inconvenience. “When you weigh the cost of losing lives, this is something you need to do,” he told CNN.He added: “These impacts, including flooding, structural damage, storm surge and serious beach erosion in our coastal communities cannot be understated.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I hope that they won’t   Butthey do they will plainly chop the legs out from under the UK position and make any further negotiation absolutely impossible   And so I say, to show our friends in Brussels that we are united in our purpose, MPs should vote with the government against Corbyn’s pointless delay.I want everybody to know – there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on  October, no s or buts.   We will not accept any attempt to go back on our promises or scrub that referendum   Armed and fortied with that conviction I believe we will get a deal at that crucial summit in October   A deal that parliament will certainly be able to scrutinise And in the meantime let our negotiators get on with their work  Without that sword of Damocles over their necks   And without an election, which I don’t want and you don’t want    Let us get on with the people’s agenda - fighting crime, improving the NHS, boosting schools, cutting the cost of living, and unlocking talent and opportunity across the entire United Kingdom  With infrastructure education and technology    It is a massive agenda. Let’s come together and get it done - and let’s get Brexit done by October ."},{"url":null,"title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"Soyoure after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further. to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun  - Receive the  biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-le stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TVShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.now! px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" And dont forget to check out the all-new Sun Mobile app - with an amazing facelt, the new app allows you to follow your favourite topics and build your very own homepage.Updated round the clock, its packed full of pictures, videos, and breaking news and showbiz exclusives you really cant find anywhere .  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s a Nile crocodile, one of  crocs kept by Andy Johnson, , in a large converted shed on his farm in Cambridgeshire.“Cuddles isn’t that cuddly. She took my fingers a few weeks ago,” he says.“Her tooth went straight through my thumb nail and she took a chunk out of this finger. If she’d bitten my wrist, she’d have had my hand clean off.”I warily eye Cuddles, as she devours half a chicken carcass.“You mustn’t get nervous. You wouldn’t ask Lewis Hamiltonhe got nervous,” Andy says, before swtly telling me how long it would take Cuddles to kill me.“She could split you in two. She’d just grab you in the middle and then go into a roll and throw a bit of you each way.  Swallow one bit, and come back for the other half.”He insists, however, that Romeo, Cuddles’ brother, is a big softie. “He loves the back of his leg being tickled. He can’t reach that bit. It keeps him calm,” Andy explains.“All the skin around their belly and legs is soft. And obviously they are cold, which is a real shock at first, especiallyyou’ve worked with warm blooded animals all your le.”Andy is a fourth-generation farmer, which is why he first got into crocodiles.He used to produce a lot quail, used to feed birds of prey, and there’s a rule stating you need to be able to destroy any birds that get ill and need to be killed.Most farmers use an incinerator - but not Andy.“We decided to use a crocodile instead,” he says, revealing he bought one from a Belgian dealer.Andy won’t go into specics, but crocs y in cost from £ to £, depending on rarity.He became fascinated by the animals after seeing them on holiday, aged , in Florida, USA, with his now we Tracey.He says they are remarkably easy to look after and – crucially – surprisingly cheap, because they eat very little.“Romeo can go  months without eating. They are % efficient. They won’t eat at all for six months in the winter,” he explained.“These eat kg at a time, but only six or seven times a year.”The main cost is heating their shed, which includes a pond in the reptiles use to cool off.The crocodiles have become quite the local celebs, too.Andy would never charge anyone to see them, but people can get a glimpse of them when they pop into the farm shop, Johsons of Old Hurst.Of course, not everyone is so enamoured by the animals – he’s had complaints from neighbours.“But that’s the British nature – in Britain they always want to knock somebody doing something successful or doing something dferent,” he says.Make no mistake: a serval cat, native to sub-Saharan Africa is no ordinary, domestic feline – for one thing they eat whole rabbits and chicks rather than cans of Whiskas.Seb’s serval cat Anubis munches the chicks, which are dubbed “penny sweets”, even though they’re considerably more expensive at £ a pop.“The most nutritional and natural food you can feed him is whole prey – eyes, brains, heart, lungs, blood, organs, bones and fur are packed with nutrients and natural proteins that these cats bodies need,” Seb explained on Instagram.Anubis’ food bill comes to £ a week.Seb and Kelly bought Anubis in , and he lives with the couple and their two children, Sienna, six, and Brandon, , at their house in Oldham, Manchester.Seb is particularly proud of the cat and has even set him up an Instagram, which proudly declares he is “The Brad Pitt of the cat world”.The doting cat dad even has a tattoo of Anubis, proudly baring his fangs, on his hand.“We love sharing his le online. The general reaction when people spot Anubis via his social media account is shock,” Kelly previously said.Anubis is about five foot high when he stands on his back legs, and servals are classed as dangerous. They have been known to attack humans – but Seb and Kelly have no worries about Anubis.“Their large size and leopard like markings scream danger to the uneducated,” says Seb. “But once you overcome the shock factor of this beautul animal you realise its docile in nature. Hes very laid back, almost dog like, very comfortable in the presence of children, slow and careful with his movements.”That said the family never leave him alone with their kids, with the cat spending a lot of his time in a large enclosure in the garden.“I am known as the mad zebra lady,” says Terri Hill, , proudly.The first two zebras she got came from Dublin Zoo, who needed to rehome them after they attacked a rhino.“They were disruptive,” Terri explains.Bailey and Murphy were volatile, apparently a trait when it comes to zebras.“They all have an aggressive streak,” she says. “People think they are really pretty, and they are -I had a pound for every time someone said, ‘Aww, they’re like a stripy pony’ I’d be very wealthy.“But they are very aggressive. Their fight or flight instinct is huge.”Most of the time the pair are in a two-acre paddock surrounded by an -foot-high fence next to Terri’s house near Bristol.The Dangerous Wild Animal licence states fences have to be at least six foot, but Terri knew that wouldn’t be enough.“I’ve had one zebra be startled by something and run and hit the fence at -foot,” she said.Another ran full force into a telephone pole which was concreted into the ground and moved in four inches.“If a zebra was to kick me, it’d probably break my leg,” she says.“If I was to corner a zebra and they decided to fight, they fight until they think you’re dead. They kick so hard and their bites are some of the toughest bites in the zoo. They are really tough cookies.”Considering how aggressive they can be, why did she agree to look after Bailey and Murphy nine years ago and then take on two more, Tori and Kelsie Terri has always been fascinated by them, specically how dferent they are to horses.She runs a livery yard, where people who own horses but no land, keep their animals, and she’s done a lot of research into zebras.So much so she now advises zoos on zebra genetics and breeding.Her main advice is that keeping wild animals isn’t a decision to take lightly.Before getting Bailey and Murphy,Terri spent a long time attending workshops and talks put on by the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums. She’s also stumped up £, for fencing and stables.Her “long-suffering” partner Drew, an ex fire-fighter is fine with the zebras, and the couple also have have Somali wild ass, and Nene, which are Hawaiaan geese.She has no interest in showing off her zebras to the public, or making any money out of them but says the cost and hassle is well worth it.“I can seem them out of kitchen and office window,” she says. “And I just love looking at them. I love looking at their stripe patterns, their movements.”Just don’t let them loose with a rhino.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And guess what has been highlighted by charity experts as the main cause “Excessive social media use.”Anyone surprised by that either  Thought not.Of course, not all children are unhappy. But parents should take this news as a serious warning shot. Because when it comes to our children’s happiness, the trend is clearly going in the wrong direction.With social media, the problem is partly one of expectations.Most grown-ups are seasoned enough to take the inevitable “my perfect le” posts on Instagram with a pinch of salt.Butyou are new to these things, being bombarded with images on your mate’s Instagram page of the le you are “meant” to be living could make even the most secure children begin to feel inadequate.The other problem is that it’s always “on” — and so are our kids. It used to be that children could shut the front door on a day of school and leave it on the outside until morning. Now, though, there is -hour access.Another news story this week revealed that nine out of ten teens aren’t getting enough sleep or exercise. It doesn’t take a genius to link the two issues.Social media — and reality TV — also reveal a new emphasis on appearance that has changed so much in the past  years, for adults as well as children. It’s just that children are more susceptible to that pressure.Other things have changed too — not least our approach to parenting . We are much more child-focused, which isn’t a bad thing necessarily.But telling our kids they are the best, no matter what they do, risks them thinking they are the best without doing anything at all to be so.Yes, we can help boost our children’s self-esteem. But what we should really do is help them boost their own self-esteem by doing things that make them feel good about themselves.Obviously, more families now have two parents in the workplace. That is a good thing but perhaps some working parents feel the need to compensate for their absence in ways — such as too many screens and “treats” — that aren’t necessarily brilliant for their children’s mental health.I write as a mother of two who worked more or less throughout my children’s young lives.I’m proud to say we all made it through in one piece.Obviously, I am no parenting expert. And I’m not claiming to have the answer to the world’s ills.But over the years, I’ve identied three golden rules I believe build a foundation for happy kids.The first is sport. I passionately believe that being part of a team, having regular exercise, being out and about and maintaining a routine offers kids stability and boundaries.It helps children feel good about their bodies and their abilities, boosting their self-esteem.The second is friendship. I am talking about proper friendship — not Facebook “friends” you never meet. When kids leave their phones at home and develop real friendships, they find people they can talk to and have fun with.Never underestimate the importance of fun. The third golden rule is probably the most important. Keep talking.There are too many tragic examples recently of young people who felt it necessary to take their own lives. I believe a problem shared is a problem halved. No matter how bad something is, talking always helps.I don’t remember ever reading about suicide when I was younger — especially not suicide in young people. Now it is the biggest cause of death among people aged  to  and it affects three times more men than women. That is a scary statistic.The causes are complicated but we need to keep channels of communication open with our kids. That way,they are unhappy, we will know about it. Andwe know about it, we at least have the potential to help.Remember Alfie Patten  For a while, in , he was known as the nation’s youngest father at the age of just .Then he found out, later that year, that it was another boy who had made his -year-old girlfriend pregnant. So Alfie was off the hook.That should have left him with the feeling that he had dodged a bullet.It could have spurred him on towards getting a good education and a job, to building himself a future.The adults in his le should have encouraged him to do just that.Instead, this week he turned up at Lewes Crown Court to be sentenced after being convicted of criminal damage.The court heard he is now a jobless alcoholic who lives at home with his mother and has a history of criminal offences.He already had a -month suspended prison sentence hanging over his head after being convicted on June  of shoplting, theft and possession of an imitation firearm.This is a good reminder that suspended sentences do not work. Alfie Patten clearly needs a bigger wake-up call than a suspended sentence or he risks ending up dead from alcohol and drugs.I saw a bench in my local park the other day that said: “Die with memories . . .  not dreams.”So true. But this guy, who is creating all the wrong sorts of memories, is a nightmare.Well, I don’t know about you but I am filled with relief that the heatwave – and even summer – is over.The cooler weather is perfect timing for going back to school and back to work, so we can all concentrate again. Hot weather is great when you are lying around in swimwear next to a pool . . .  notyou are sitting in a classroom or office.I  loved the photos of Dame Joan Collins, , lined up with the other stars of the Charlotte Tilbury makeup campaign.What a lady. Joan, is classy, funny and damn stylish. Or as my nan would’ve said, well turned out.Another day, another story about taxpayers’ money being wasted in foreign aid.This week it emerged that classrooms in nearly  schools in Pakistan – paid for by us – have been closed because they were badly built and unsafe.The buildings were erected as part of a £million aid project and their closure has left , children taking lessons outdoors or in overcrowded rooms.So, presumably, back where they were in the first place. On the upside, this has prompted some MPs to call for an inquiry about how our annual foreign aid budget – around £billion – is spent.On the downside, this is an example of yet more foreign aid money that has fallen into the wrong hands and ended up being wasted.In the meantime, British schools are crying out for investment.So why are we spending money on Pakistani schools and not our own Meanwhile, in the UK, overseas patients have left the NHS with more than £million in unpaid bills for treatment, it emerged this week. That cash could pay for , nurses, , heart bypasses or nearly , junior doctors.Two London hospitals are owed £million each, including almost £, from one patient alone.Apparently staff are reluctant to chase payments, with doctors’ leaders saying their obligation to charge overseas patients is “racist” and deters vulnerable groups from seeking help.To me, that sounds completely bonkers.I don’t understand why you are not asked to produce your NHS number – we all have one – when you get to hospital.Every other country asks, so why not us It’s a national service, not an international one.Former Big Brother contestant Kate Lawler is campaigning to remove the taboo facing women who don’t want children.She said she considers her two dogs, Baxter and Shirley, as her family and she’s very content with that.She’s right, of course. Whether or not you want children comes down to personal choice and it should be fine for women not to want them.I think the most important thing when choosing whether or not to have kids with someone is the pair of you both being on the same page. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The decision must be for the common sense of the British people.”That decision was duly taken in the biggest single-issue democratic vote in British history.Hammond has been fighting ever since to turn it on its head.This is the real constitutional outrage. A defeated rump of Remainers, egged on by blatantly biased Commons Speaker John Bercow, is using every Parliamentary trick to destroy Brexit.Some threaten to occupy Parliament until dragged out by police.Left-wing class warriors will infuriate voters by blocking bridges and highways and stopping them getting to work.John Major and meddling Gina Miller have launched a Supreme Court bid to block No Deal.These are petulant tantrums.

Until now.Sometimes you will hear the Commons derided as a talking-shop but that, correctly, is what it is. Talking can prevent violence.There is a reason modern heads of government are not, by and large, stabbed in their beds like poor King Duncan in Shakespeare’s Macbeth.That reason has been the parliamentary process and the comforting knowledge that when push came to shove, parliamentarians would be on our side.Our side, please note. Not on the side of rival countries.There developed a quiet understanding that on issues of conscience , MPs need not slavishly follow their constituents. They were not quite delegates.But as representatives, they would be expected to follow broadly the sympathies of their electors and the policies of their parties. Otherwise they could just lie at election time then do the opposite once they had won their seats in the Commons.In his address outside  Downing Street last night, Boris left people in no doubt of his intentions to see us out of the EU after October .But when MPsto the Commons this afternoon, you will hear Remainers complain that “Parliament has been bypassed” in the Brexit process. This is tommyrot.As can happen in modern politics, it is the very opposite of the truth. I’m afraid they’re lying. They are ignoring you — the electorate — and they think you are too busyto notice.The EU referendum in  was set up by the Commons.The Commons approved the Article  process under which we told Brussels we were off. All well and good.David Cameron would not have won the  election had he not promised a referendum.Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn would not have attracted millions of votes in the  election had they not promised to respect the Leave result.But now that our departure is imminent, Remainer extremists such as Hammond, Bercow, Gauke, Grieve, Soubryplan to try to stop it.They have already bent the rules doing so and will possibly do so again today.Please, guys: Spare us any bleating about “constitutional outrages” by Boris. Your behaviour has been far worse.These swivel-eyed Europhiles have decided that the Leave vote of  — the biggest exercise in British electoral history — must be neutralised.The plebs got it wrong. Computer does not recognise. Reboot time. All past data has been lost.Just look at that warped figure Tony Blair, who treated Parliament with open contempt when he was PM.Yesterday he was throwing up his soft hands in horror at the idea of a new General Election to break the Westminster deadlock. He opposes an election because he knows it could result in a big win for an on-fire Boris. All this from the same Tony Blair whose regime helped kill hundreds of thousands of Iraqis in the name of, er, democracy.Instead, Blair wants a second referendum, whose wording would be decidedby the current, pro-EU, electorate-defying Parliament.We used to laugh at communist assemblies in countries such as North Korea, which were stuffed full of identikit dummies.We mocked minnows such as Ireland, which were forced by Brussels to re-run referendums that produced “wrong” results.We thought our democracy was more authentic because Parliament was connected to its constituents and because our politicians accepted the electorate’s verdict.We won’t be able to make such boastsWestminster’s Remainers have their way.What is the point of a parliamentit ignores the electorate  None. Many of these Remainer MPs seem readier to take their cue from Twitter users than from their own voters. It’s weird and it is not democracy.If our Parliament ceases to have a point, so do its buildingsand so do its members’ privileges .The very nation state becomes questionable, for what is the point of a state without a democratic Parliament Before long you find yourself asking what is the point of Western Europe, Nato and the whole web of Western values that separate us from Putin’s Russia and other hostile powers.Such is the importance of the decisions facing our MPs this week. Let’s hope they ponder hard before vetoing Brexit, the greatest-ever popular demand for change. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Do not serve this man”, and together the pair handed them out to all his local takeaways and asked the owners not to let him in.At the time, single Dibsy was miserable. He couldn’t get a job and had to wear specially made clothes.Now, ten months on, he has lost nearly half his body weight, passed his driving test and got a girlfriend.He has given up fizzy drinks and booze and swapped takeaways for a calorie-controlled diet and exercise.He is down to , calories a day and is burning , of those with his fitness regime.His gruelling training schedule comprises three gym sessions a day.And it has paid off. At st lb, he is close to his target weight of st.Exhausted Dibsy, recovering in Mike’s gym after a training session, said: “If someone told me last year I would be entering the Great North Run I would have thought they were crackers.“I was at death’s door because of my lestyle. I was a million miles away from doing a half-marathon.“But I have got to the starting line thanks to hard work, determination and the support of an incredible group of people.“Obesity is a major problem in the UK but I am living proof that it can be beaten. If I can do it, then anyone can.”The UK is the third fattest nation in Europe, according to the World Health Organisation, with more than a quarter of the population officially obese.And the North East, where Dibsy lives, is one of the fattest regions in the country.He has struggled with his weight all his le, and the death of his father from cancer when he was  only worsened his comfort-eating.His huge bulk had a devastating effect on his le.He couldn’t get a job, visits to the cinema were out because the seats were too small for him and he had to book two seats whenever he travelled by train or plane.He couldn’t even wear a watch because no strap was big enough for his wrist.Dibsy knew he had to act after a heart scare landed him in hospital last year. A doctor told him he would die unless he changed his lestyle.It was just after that when he visited Mike’s diner with his mum.Married dad-of-three Mike began putting him through his paces at his Mas Body Gym in their home town of Middlesbrough and provided all his meals from his healthy eating diner.Dibsy said: “I am much more confident now. Physically I am in a better state than I have been for years.“Mentally I am the best I’ve ever been in my le.“There are so many things I can do for the first time that other people take for granted.“I have never been able to drive because I couldn’t fit behind a steering wheel.“But I have now passed my test, which has given me an incredible amount of freedom.“I love heading to the beach for a walk with my labrador Rosie. And I can take my mum for trips out now. For the first time ever I have been able to buy clothes off the peg.“I went to a sports shop to buy some tracksuits and I was like a kid in a toy shop.”Among all the developments in his le, the one that has put the biggest smile on his face is a new romance.He is coy about naming this love interest, as they have only been dating for a couple of weeks, but he said: “It’s lovely just to have someone to share this journey that I’m on.“She messaged me when I started losing weight and has kept in touch and it has grown from there.“We talk every day and she really supports me. It’s great on an evening when I have finished my gym for the day just to have someone to spend time with and share a bit of banter with.”Dibsy has been disciplined with his fitness and diet routine but he did nearly fall off the wagon once.He said: “On a Saturday night a few months ago I was at home and bored.“I was looking through Facebook and everyone seemed to be having a takeaway and a few beers.“I put a message up saying I was struggling and was thinking of having a takeaway myself.“Someone alerted Mike, who was at a family party, and within  minutes he had phoned me and said he was coming round.“We went out for a walk and he talked to me about what we were trying to achieve.“Then he took me to the hospital, where you can get weighed, and he showed me how much weight I had lost.“He said, ‘That’s why we are doing this’. I was so pleased the next day that I hadn’t given in to temptation.“I can’t put in to words how grateful I am to Mike for everything he’s done.”Ahead of the Great North Run Dibsy has completed the challenge of climbing the ,ft Ben Nevis, in Scotland.Mike, , said: “One of the big issues in his past is his dad dying. So to inspire him I thought about what is the closest he can get to his dad.“Well, you can’t get closer to heaven in the UK than the highest mountain, so we climbed that.“It took us three and a half hours to get up there.“Dibsy scattered some of his dad’s ashes and it was a lovely moment.“On the way home someone said, ‘What’s next ’. Dibsy’s journey began in the North East so I thought it would be a good idea to finish here, and there is no bigger local event than the Great North Run.”Dibsy and Mike managed to get last-minute entries thanks to local charity Boro Walkers. Dibsy said: “I don’t know how much I will be able to run and how much I will have to walk, but I will do it.“Being cheered on by that wonderful crowd will be a fantastic experience.”Many along the route will recognise Dibsy, whose profile has soared since he began dieting.He has appeared on TV’s This Morning and won the backing of hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby.The celeb pair pledged to contribute to the £, he needs for an operation to remove st of excess skin once he hits st.He is not eligible for the surgery on the NHS as he embarked on his weight loss programme privately.After the op, Dibsy will be getting a job for the first time in his le. Mike said: “He will work in my diner serving other people who need to lose weight.“He will be a living, breathing example of what can be achieved with a good fitness routine and sensible diet. He will be an inspiration.”Dibsy has already become a mentor for others. He said: “I get messages every day from people all over the world. It is often a case of, ‘I can’t do it, I have tried and tried and I just can’t lose weight’.“I answer every one of them and tell them I am living proof that it can be done.“The most important thing is to not leave it too late. I used up nearly every one of my nine lives and put my family through hell.“My mum used to lie awake at night to check I was breathing.“The most important thing is to start as soon as possible.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it’s  advertising.”The revelation came two years after Game was abruptly fired from Hope for Wholeness.In the interview, the -year-old called for the dissolution of conversion therapy groups.The widely discredited practice, which is intended to suppress or change a person’s sexuality through counselling or religion, is currently banned in  states.Many national health and medical associations have dismissed the practice as ineffective and damaging to the health of LGBTQ youth.In , the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from a list of mental illnesses.Game said he is trying to come to terms with the harm he inflicted through his program.He said: “I was a religious zealot that hurt people. People said they attempted suicide over me and the things I said to them. People, I know, are in therapy because of me.Why would I want that to continue ”Ex-PM Theresa May last year vowed to ban the “abhorrent” practice of trying to turn gay people straight under an action plan to improve the lives of LGBT people.The world’s largest LGBT Government survey ever carried out showed more than , people had undergone “therapy” with at least , being offered it out of more than , respondents.The £. million initiative declared: “We will consider all legislative and non-legislative options to prohibit promoting, offering or conducting conversion therapy.”Researchers found the LGBT community are experiencing prejudice on a daily basis.Game is still married to a woman, Julie Game, who he says knows he is gay, reported New York Post.After coming out, he said he readied himself for intense backlash.He still receives angry Facebook messages from people who say they were traumatised by his program.In a Facebook post last week, he wrote a y apology, saying: “I WAS WRONG! Please forgive me!I certainly regret where I caused harm. I know that creating the organisation that still lives was in a large way causing harm.Creating a catchy slogan that put out a very misleading idea of Freedom from homosexuality through Jesus Christ was definitely harmful.Promoting the triadic model that blamed parents and conversion or prayer therapy, that made many people believe that their orientation was wrong, bad, sinful, evil, and worse that they could change was absolutely harmful.People reported to attempt suicide because of me and these teachings and ideals.I told people they were going to Hellthey didn’t stop, and these were professing Christians!

It will be ruinous.”But the rebels countered that Mr Johnson had yet to show any proof of momentum in Brexit negotiations with the EU that could lead to an agreement before the October  deadline.Earlier, Mr Hammond had vowed to stage the “fight of a letime” to remain as the Tory candidate for Runnymede and Weybridge, despite de-selection threats.He stormed: “This is my party.”The bitter fallout came on an unprecedented day of Tory turmoil as:The dramatic developments left the Tories facing their worst split in three decades tonight as No swtly suspended the whip from every Tory rebel who voted against the Government.Among them are nine former Cabinet ministers, including Ken Clarke as well as Mr Hammond and Sir Nicholas.The Sun can reveal that Mr Johnson made a massive personal effort to persuade his old friend and Mid Sussex MP grandee Sir Nicholas not to rebel, including a -minute phone call to him on Monday night.But Sir Nicholas told The Sun just ahead of the vote that he had decided to defy Boris “with a very heavy heart”.He added: “I don’t doubt Boris wants to get a deal, but I do not believe he has the means to will the end. His demands are unreal and I cannot condone No Deal.”Mr Lee — a pro-EU MP for the safe seat of Bracknell who was already facing de-selection — blamed the party’s sht to the right on Brexit for his walkout.THE  Tories who rebelled in tonight’s vote are:The defection rubbed out the PM’s wafer-thin majority of just one, making a General Election now all but certain.In a bid to inflict maximum damage on Mr Johnson, he publicly crossed the Commons floor to sit on the opposition benches just as the Premier began a statement to a packed house on the G summit.No also confirmed that the serial Tory rebel — who wants a second referendum — gave the PM no warning about his move.Former Education Secretary Justine Greening began the walkouts this morning saying she would stand down at the next General Election to pre-empt the PM’s punishment.She said: “My concerns about the Conservative Party becoming the Brexit Party have come to pass.”But rebel leader Mr Hammond vowed to fight Mr Johnson’s threat through the courts having won re-selection from his constituency association on Monday night.Other loyal Tories angrily hit out at Mr Johnson’s expulsion threat. Former de facto Deputy PM Damian Green dubbed the crackdown “foolish in the extreme”.Former Tory defence minister Tobias Ellwood said earlier: “A party which threatens to remove Churchill’s grandson should check its tactics.”We are repulsed by the self-satisfaction and sickening disregard for our democracy of those behind it: Marxist Labour, the Lib Dems, deluded Tory “rebels”, grandstanding ex-Tory defectors.Last week our streets were blocked by idiotic Europhile protesters, with zero sense of proportion or grasp of history, witlessly branding Boris Johnson a “dictator” orchestrating “a coup”. He must be the first dictator defeated within days by a Parliamentary majority.But how can the Remainer antics be called anything but a coup When MPs who once vowed to honour the referendum result vote instead to proceed with a dodgy Bill, enabled by their puppet Speaker, surrendering power to the EU to determine a delay of its choosing — to be rubber-stamped by our Remainer-dominated Parliament.Will three months suit Brussels  Six, maybe  How about ten years Remainers will, have no doubt, sign off whatever the EU decides.They have no plan, beyond the second referendum some want.

They’re not all “champions”, or possibly even the best each respective part of the Cowell empire has to offer.That goose was cooked the moment SuBo, Diversity, Dennis Egeland almost everyone  with a signicant career or talent declined to appear.There was a certain curiosity value to BGT: The Champions, though, I’ll admit, as it featured several performers doing the one thing everyone in their country should arguably be forbidden from even attempting.Indian salsa, Ukrainian sand-painting, Australian stand-up comedy, Indonesian magic, British dog dancing.This last one was  winner Ashleigh Butlerwho began by revealing that, moments before Pudsey died: “He lted his head and had a little look at me.That was him saying ‘Goodbye’.” Or  him saying: “You’ll be going through the same motions, with some hyperactive little impostor, in two years’ time, mark my words.”I got the impression everyone  at the show thought it might just be “a bit too soon”, as well, which may not entirely explain The Champions’ in-built British bias.But the line-up was certainly front-loaded with other familiar faces, Paul Potts, Boogie Storm and Connie Talbot, who’s doubled in size since we last saw her, with Piers Morgan, in . So’s Piers Morgan, for that matter.The great unknown factors were the foreign acts, though, who proved to be a pretty forgettable bunch apart from America’s “comic daredevil” Bello Nock, whose wheel of death t***tery, with daughter Annaliese, was almost as terrying as his appearance,which was described perfectly, by David Walliams, as “Jedward’s dad”.It was certainly enough to hypnotise the Wembley arena audience into voting him the winner.If all this exotica and the set were designed to make us think we were watching something on the scale of Eurovision, though, it failed. The Champions is nothing like as good.Nor is it even as original as Going For Gold, with Henry Kelly, for the simple reason BGT has been welcoming foreign acts for years.All this adds up to is Britain’s Got Talent minus the best bit, the auditions. We also don’t get a chance to vote, either.That came down to a golden buzzer Amanda Holden went for the Ukrainian sandpainter and the arena vote for Bello Nock.Quite something, isn’t it, when we can’t even win such a heavily loaded show and, I have to tell you, Paul Potts took it pretty badly. Simon Cowell, though, had some words of comfort for Ashleigh.“Pusdey’s in dog heaven, looking down on you now, thinking . . . ” “I was the talent. I was the bloody talent.”DIVA Forever’s Gemma Collins landed in Los Angeles last Wednesday night on ITVBe with all the charm and subtlety of a jolt from the San Andreas Fault.Take comfort, though, from the fact our gain is very much Calornia’s loss.Because within five minutes of arriving she’d already decided, “I ain’t going back to England”, and was using her new catchphrase to describe everything.Hamburgers  “Next level.” Hollywood Hills mansions  “Next level.” The Beverly Wilshire hotel  It’s next friggin’ level. She seemed to have her priorities right, though.Before going anywhere near a green card applicationshe got pretend friend Jonathan Cheban to take her to cosmetic surgeon to the stars, Doctor Simon Ourian: “Because I want a facelt while I’m here.How long will I need ” How long have you got, Gemma  It’s next level.FINAL word on Celebs Go Dating belongs to ­brilliant narrator Rob Beckett.Lauren Goodger: “Everyone’s, like, ‘Did you find love, did you meet anyone ’And I’m, like, yeah I did. I found Lauren Goodger.”“S**test game of hide and seek ever.”BBC’s brilliant Untouchable: The Rise And Fall Of Harvey Weinstein documentary.Damon Herriman’s performance as Charles Manson in episode five, series two, of Netflix’s Mindhunter.ITV’s impressively handled A Confession. And theof greatest ever breakfast television duo Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid to GMB.Cos I don’t mind telling you, I’ve really missed the hoary old cricket anecdotes, that unfeasibly small yet hyperactive mouth and all three of those le-insurance-risk chins. And Piers as well. IF this fth series of Peaky Blinders achieves nothing , then Irish actor Brian “Jimmy McCavern” Gleeson’s attempt at a Scottish accent has certainly highlighted the problems of frictionless borders.Back and forth it pings between Dublin and Belfast.With the odd stop-off in downtown Hyderabad, before settling at something closer to Hercule Poirot Belgian rather than the leader of a depression-era Glaswegian razor gang thug he’s meant to be.It has a knock-on effect as well. Notice one thing that’s wrong with the show, you’ll probably notice everything  as well.Like the fact it’s all over the place historically, Paul “Arthur” Anderson is over-acting so badly the estate of Yosemite Sam should sue and Helen McCrory doesn’t look foxy dressed up as Janet Jackson. She just looks ridiculous.Underneath all that baggage and the obtrusive soundtrack, there is, I think, a serviceable enough plot involving Oswald Mosley, the IRA, the UVF, even though they weren’t formed until , and all sorts of carnage involving gypsies and Glasgow’s infamous Billy Boys gang, which our friend Brian Gleeson attempted to put into sharp focus at the end of Sunday night’s episode.“Zo, Tummy ­Shell-beee, it’s wuuuurgh yur wunt, it’s wurgh you zjall ’ave.” No, me neither.THIS week’s winner is BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker and Beaker from The Muppets.Compiled by Graham WrayJONATHAN Ross, in , to producer Andy Davies, on the subject of his -year-old neighbour: “I think you should, just for charity, give her one.”Jonathan Ross, in August , to Judge Rinder, on the subject of Brazilian President Bolsonaro’s disparaging remarks about Emmanuel Macron’s we: “I’m team Macron.It’s the most pathetic and most misogynistic thing they could say. It’s pretty awful, it’s pretty horrible really.”Jonathan, you’re a helluva guy.Sink Or Swim, Arg: “I’m going to be the plus-sized Michael Phelps.”And for all those wondering what the technical term for that is, it’s Michael Feltz.LIKE most of you, I watched a lively old bird called Judith serenade four sets of shrivelling male goolies with a chorus of The Lord Is My Shepherd before taking all of her clothes off on Wednesday night’s Naked Attraction.Then I switched over to Newsnight, where arch-Remainer Paul Mason was discussing Brexit and, I promise you, he sounded about a thousand times more unhinged. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA sobering realisation has dawned which summed up how far the Tories have walked away from sanity towards self-destruction. Party grandee Sir Nicholas Soames declared that he felt so passionately about Boris Johnson’s unscrupulous power grab he was prepared to vote against his government and pay the price of deselection as an MP. In other words, Johnson, the great Churchill wannabe who fancies himself as the true heir to the mightiest of Conservative legends, would be faced with telling Winston’s grandson he was booting him out of his Tory seat for defying his wishes. Even though Soames became a Conservative MP at around the time Johnson left school. And Johnson is an unelected Downing Street squatter with a majority of none.  Had you told informed political observers a few years ago that such a scenario would unfold in , they would have laughed in your face . But the party that loves to refer to itself as “the longest-running and most successful in political history” is now so far removed from reality it cannot see how it is allowing itself to be ripped apart like the entrails of a fox during a Beaufort Hunt. Former Chancellor Philip Hammond, who usually has the placid demeanour of a bereavement counsellor, said he and fellow MPs were “incensed” by Johnson’s aggressive tactics and “feel very strongly that now is the time we have to put the national interest ahead of any threats to us personally”. Another former minister, the normally placid Justine Greening, said she’d had enough of Johnson’s “profoundly un-Conservative” no-deal policy and was walking before she could be pushed by vowing to stand down at the next election.    Alistair Burt, Caroline Nokes and Antoinette Sandbach did the same, with the latter saying: “I feel so strongly about this that I’m prepared to put my job on the line for my constituents.” And we learned they weren’t the only natural Tories whom Johnson has tried to shaft since he has been in power. A document was released to an Edinburgh court which showed he gave the go-ahead on August  to suspend Parliament, two weeks before asking the monarch to allow him to prorogue it as a last resort. So he’s even conning the -year-old Queen. But did we expect anything  from a proven liar, who is consumed with a belief he was born to rule and is willing to crush anyone and anything, including his nation’s best interests, to achieve it  No. Especially now his strings are being pulled by a clearly unhinged master of the dark arts, his chief of staff Dominic Cummings, whom David Cameron once called a “career psychopath”. Sadly this country is being run by the least principled and least talented Tory government ever. But Johnson is not the sole cause of his party’s horror show. He has just strolled on to the set with a gimp mask and a blood-drenched machete  minutes before the final credits.

The Tories’ one-time golden boy lost his Commons majority today, after losing a by-election on his second day in No, which raises questions about his future. A lousy Foreign Secretary and indferent London Mayor, Johnson is now a puppet PM with the strings pulled by Brextremist head-bangers leaving him in a tangle. Shutting down Parliament to suspend its sovereignty, threatening to break the law, then bullying MPs, vowing to end their careersthey did what he did twice and voted against Brexit, were the desperate histrionics of a flailing tinpot tyrant in Drowning Street. His supposed masterstrokes backfired spectacularly, forcing insulted Conservatives to find their backbones and stand up to a political flibbertigibbet.    No mandate or majority exists in the country or in Parliament for the Kamikaze type of Brexit an untrustworthy Boris Johnson suddenly pretends is a runner. Equally, his claim that talks with the EU are making progress is unsupported by the evidence – although you cannot rule out the possibility that in future this twister would try to pass off Theresa May’s thrice-rejected “vassal state” plan as his own, inspired, fresh magical answer. Shackling mendacious Johnson and putting his Halloween Horror back in the box is vital before a General Election is held. Playing this Tory chancer’s game would end in tears and Jeremy Corbyn’s work will be cut out justying a contest shortly, instead of immediately, after repeatedly, regularly demanding an election.

Since then she has married, started a family and owned a successful business. Anna estimates she has paid £, in tax and has raised her two children here. Always living in Bristol, Anna has attended school and university in Britain and considers the UK her home. But the British government doesnapost agree and her request for permanent residency has been rejected.    Devastated Anna was told she did not have enough evidence to document her status - despite sending an entire box of information that was so heavy it cost £ to post. She had spent three months compiling her paperwork, which included tax s, banks statements, qualications and her national insurance number. Anna said: You are in your country, it is a democracy, all of a sudden you are told after this time no one knows what is going to happen to you. Where do I go  It is really, really scary. Following her refusal for permanent residency, in writing, Anna made a series of frantic phone calls and sent almost a dozen emails, certain there had been a mistake.    In one a government official told her she had failed to prove herself as, “a qualied person either as a worker, a self-employed person, a student, a jobseeker, or a self-sufficient person”. Anna ran a pizza takeaway business for almost  years and has also worked as a personal assistant and a counsellor. She said: All of a sudden, they snatch it away from you. You become unstable. It gives you anxiety, stress, you know it affects every aspect of your le. It is so upsetting. The Home Office has stressed Anna did not apply for permanent residency under the EU Settlement Scheme and had instead made her application under EEA regulations. Under the EEA Regulations , a person who is eligible for immigration to the UK is known as a ‘qualied person’. The government added Anna has not reapplied for permanent residency under the EU Settlement Scheme but stressed she had been given advice on where to get help.    A spokesman said: The EU Settlement Scheme makes it easy for EU citizens and their families to get the status they need to remain in the UK and they have until at least December  to apply. “Nobody has been granted pre-settled status without first being offered, and declining, the opportunity to submit evidence that they qualy for settled status, and our latest statistics show that by the end of July, nobody had been refused.” “Over one million people have been granted status.” But Anna is not sure she wants to apply for the status for a second time and has said she will deal with the consequences. She could apply for citizenship through her British husband but says sheaposs offended by the idea of having to sit an English and history test and paying more than a thousand pounds to get citizenship after living in Britain for over half a century. Anna said: I resent the fact I have to apply for settlement in my own country. If I apply again, I am enabling the system. What is next  A badge, branding ” Amato says her Italian father, who had dementia in later le and died in March, would be upset at how EU migrants are being treated.    He moved his family to Britain to work in a factory making washing machines in , a time when Britain was looking abroad for workers. Anna said: He loved the UK because he thought it was a fair and decent nation. He was proud to be here. I feel betrayed. Her story is one of many being faced by EU nationals who have made the UK their home. For decades, Britain’s membership of the EU has guaranteed the bloc’s citizens the right to live and work in the country. But as Britain prepares to sever ties with Brussels after  years, EU citizens must apply for a new legal leline to remain, known as settled status.    Under the government’s plans, EU citizens who can prove they have lived continuously in Britain for five years will be granted settled status, giving them the same rights to work, study and benefits they currently hold. Many EU nationals are concerned they could lose the right to free healthcare or employment. Others are worried about how they will prove they have the right to they travel abroad.The fate of EU migrants has been thrown further into confusion by the government’s announcement this month that their automatic right to live and work in Britain will end abruptly - and sooner than expected - in the event of a no-deal Brexit .The government launched its EU Settlement Scheme for registering EU citizens in January this year.    The status of British and EU nationals living in each other’s territories has been one of the most important issues in Brexit talks, which have dragged on for the past three years. Both sides have promised to ensure settled citizens do not lose any rights.In his first statement to parliament after becoming Prime Minister in July, Boris Johnson said he wanted to thank EU citizens living in Britain for their contribution and promised to ensure they could remain after Brexit.There are now fears the issues facing EU nationals who have to prove their status could mirror the Windrush scandal. This led to British citizens of Caribbean origin denied rights despite living lawfully in the country for decades.    Some lost jobs, others were wrongly deported.Labour politician Virendra Sharma said: Anna’s story is a tragic one.How can somebody who has given so much of their le to the UK, who went to school here and got married here, have their existence in this country wiped  I think most people would say that can’t be right. Even Brexit supporters are calling for more to be done about the issue.    Daniel Hannan, a prominent Brexit supporter and Conservative lawmaker in the European Parliament, has called on the government to do more, saying he had been contacted by EU nationals in his constituency denied long-term residency. He said: This is a breach of the assurances I and other Leavers gave during the referendum. Please help sort this out. Until recently, the government had been advising the estimated . million EU citizens living in Britain that they had until December  to register to retain their rights. So far, only about  million people have applied. Richard Bertinet, a renowned French chef who has lived in Britain for the past  years, was denied settled status after applying earlier this month with the help of his British we, a former lawyer.    Bertinet, who has written two award-winning cookbooks, appeared on cookery TV shows and set up a bakery that supplies upmarket supermarket chain Waitrose, said he had only been granted pre-settled status. The government gave him the right to stay until , when he will need to reapply for settled status. He said: It is painful and embarrassingI have spent more time in my le in this country than in France. Bertinet said he fears more for vulnerable people, such as those who speak poor English or the elderly.

Former head teacher Richard Selley, who is battling motor neurone disease, says he would have been able to spend more time with his familyassisted dying had been legal in the UK. But the law requires him to administer the lethal dose himself, which means he must travel while he is still able. Writing on his blog, Richard, , said: ‘Throughout this month, I have known that I will die on September . That has been a surreal experience, not dissimilar, perhaps, to that faced by someone waiting in a condemned cell. “I will end my le in a few days’ time, and I have to admit, those moments have rarely been out of my mind recently, I have shed some tears, but my overriding emotion has been one of relief.    “As I have said my goodbyes to family and friends, or read their farewell messages, I have felt profoundly sad, but feelings such as anger and despair left me long ago.Elaine will be at my side in Switzerland, and although parting from each other will be unbearable, she knows that I cannot battle with this awful disease any longer. “I am exhausted by it, and it is time to go.” Richard, who can no longer speak or swallow, says he has become a “prisoner in his body” and is spending £, travelling from his home in Glenalmond, Perthshire to the Dignitas clinic.

The law requires Richard to undertake every step of the process himself, meaning he must travel before he is unable to administer the fatal dose himself. Elaine said the situation was robbing her of precious extra time with her husband. She said: “Richard is very clear what he wants to do and he doesn’t want to see other people going through this. He wants to take control.    “It’s a horrible thing to go through, as his partner. Going to Switzerland is not something we want to have to do. “If I could keep him for even one more day that would be great but he’s got to be able to do everything himself - he’s got to travel and administer the medication himself. “They are making him choose to go early because he’s afraid that the choice is going to be taken from him and he wants to avoid a prolonged death.” She saidpatients were able to end their own lives in this country strict rules could be brought in, similar to those in Switzerland, where two doctors have to certy the patient is of sound mind. She said: “It’s only a small proportion of people that would ever take this route in the last months of their lives...it’s not going to open the floodgates. “Assisted dying is not suicide...it’s for people who are already dying.” Richard was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease in March . Richard says his earliest suspicions that he had MND were triggered by having watched The Theory Of Everything, a biopic about the le of Professor Stephen Hawking. Only three months after seeing the film, he was diagnosed with the terminal illness and his ability to speak, walk and eat began to deteriorate. The average le expectancy after diagnosis is about  months but the former economics teacher has now lived with the illness for just over four years.

Darren Dibsy McClintock, who now weighs st, will join , other runners and take his place at the starting line of the world-famous half-marathon on September . The -year-old, who once tipped the scales at st lbs, decided he needed to take drastic action and got help from personal trainer and friend Mike Hind following a health scare. Mike had put posters up with the message: Save Dibsy. Obesity is killing him. Do not serve this man.He lost nearly half his body weight in just  months after sticking to a strict diet and plenty of exercise after being banned from local takeaways in his hometown of Middlesborough.He told The Sun : “I was at death’s door because of my lestyle. I was a million miles away from doing a half-marathon.“Obesity is a major problem in the UK but I am living proof that it can be beaten. If I can do it, then anyone can.” At one stage, he was consuming , calories a day after feasting on unhealthy fast food such as pizzas, chips and sausage sandwiches. But after seeing his mumaposs reaction to doctoraposs warnings, he decided it was time to do something about it. His le has been transformed after starting his weight-loss journey late last year. Darren said: Instead of picking the healthy option I would always go for what I liked, stuff like pies, pasties, crisps and chips.  It got to the point where my legs and back were aching all the time and I ended up in hospital. The doctor asked meI want to live a long le and said I canapost go on the way I am or Iaposd be dead before too long. Seeing my mumaposs reaction to it all was heartbreaking,it wasnapost for that I might never have changed. I have had a lot of finger pointing and laughing over the years and I was bullied at school. Thataposs another reason for making a change now, so that I can live a normal le. Much of Dibsyaposs progress is thanks to personal trainer Mike, who takes on a client for free once a year.

Emergency services rushed to Holly Hutchinson when the little girlaposs heartbeat reached  beats a minute. In an attempt to shock her heart back into a normal rhythm, the paramedics put her head into a bucket of freezing cold water for five seconds. When this failed, they took Holly to Freeman Hospital in Newcastle where powerful drugs were administered. Ten minutes before midnight on New Yearaposs Eve, the -day-old baby stabilised. As fireworks went off outside, stunned parents Jenny and Ian Hutchinson were given the happy news that Holly was recovering. Her father said: Holly is a little legend, and she started to fight back after they shocked her heart and ious other procedures, Ian added. It was only  minutes until midnight on New Yearaposs Eve when we received the news that her heart had gone back into its normal rhythm and was stable.

On New Yearaposs Eve her mother, who is a paediatric nurse, noticed that her babyaposs condition had deteriorated and took her to the Sunderland Royal Hospital. There, her heart rate climbed to  beats per minute in an abnormal rhythm caused by an infection in her heart.    Doctors tried to shock the little girlaposs organ into the correct rhythm, even resorting to dunking her head into a bucket of ice cold water for five seconds. After several attempts to shock her heart using other methods failed, she was rushed to the Freeman Hospital where the process was repeated and she was intubated. Right in front of our eyes, we could see the blood retracting from Hollyaposs limbs to try and protect her core, making her go grey, Ian recalled. It was absolutely horrendous to see our newborn become so ill, so quickly. Watching her being submerged in the water and be prodded with needles like a pin cushion is something no parent wants to see. It was so hard knowing there was nothing we could do.    When we arrived at Freeman Hospital we were taken into a side room and left there while they tried to save Hollyaposs le. We felt like we were there for an age, but we knew she was in the best possible place. Despite the bleak initial outlook, Holly made an incredible recovery - spending just  days there before being discharged home to Gateshead. Mr Hutchinson was full of praise for the help they received from the Sick Childrenaposs Trust, as it meant they could stay nearby while Holly, who has an older sister called Emily, recovered. He said: Itaposs completely under-appreciated how important it is to be together as a family when your childaposs in hospital. Being with Emily and Jen made such a dference, it kept me sane.

Sharon Blakemore admits she had problems with her weight, stretching back to her childhood. When the -year-old was still at school she had to wear menaposs shirts as part of her unorm to fit her -inch collar. By the time she was an adult, Sharon was forced to wear mens XL clothes to fit her size  frame. But when she lost both her parents to cancer within  months of each other, Sharon made a solemn vow to each of them that she would fight the flab.    Sharon, from Crewe, Cheshire, says she had eaten two pies every day from the age of  and was a big fan of takeaways. At her heaviest, she weighed almost  stone but is now just  stone and a size . Sharon celebrated her huge achievement with a tattoo that inking artists had originally told her she was too fat to have. Former shopkeeper and stay-at-home mum Sharonsaid: Iaposve had people that havenapost seen me in years following me around the supermarket trying to work outit definitely is me. They say aposI didnapost even recognise youapos. When I was in school I used to have to get menaposs shirts for my unorm because I was a  inch collar, and when I was pregnant there wasnapost any womenaposs shops that sold a size  so Iaposd have to go to Evans or Jacamo or menaposs sports shops.    My mum was a childrenaposs nurse, so she had tried for years to help me eat better, but I never listened – Iaposd just pinch the food out the cupboards when she wasnapost looking and eat what I wanted. But when she was dying she said ‘you really need to sort yourself out’.She was worried, because when youaposre overweight cancer is an even bigger risk. She said to me, ‘ not for us do it for the kids’. “Then, when my dad was in the same position just over a year after we lost mum, he said to me aposyouaposve done really well already but you promised your mum, so you have to carry onapos. I managed to hit the  stone mark at the very start of this year, and just this week Iaposve been able to buy some size  clothes. It feels amazing.    As well as pies and takeaways, Sharon would also gorge on biscuits and crisps. But before her mum, Yvonne, passed away from stomach cancer in January  aged just , she begged her daughter to lose weight. Just  months later, in June , Sharonaposs dad, Frank, died of cancer aged just , and again urged her to shed the pounds. She admits her overwhelming grief was initially the reason she started losing weight - but she never forgot the promises she had made to her parents.By the time she got married to Ian, her long-term partner and father of her two children two years later in , Sharon had already dropped down to  stone.    Now, the active mum regularly plays netball, goes to the gym three times a week at Gymophobics in Nantwich, Cheshire, and does a weekly Clubbercise dance workout class as well as eating healthy home-cooked food and following the : diet. Sharon, who has lost more than  inches from her figure in total, said: From as young as  I would go across the road to the supermarket and buy a pack of two pies on my lunch break and eat them both. “Iaposd do that three or four times a week, and sometimes Iaposd put the pie between two slices of bread and make a pie butty with chips on the side. I think back and I just donapost know how I ate it all. “At the beginning I didnapost have to try because it was down to losing my mum and dad, the weight dropped just dropped off me, I lost about a stone a week.    “Even when I was big I didn’t struggle with my confidence, but now the comments people give you really do spur you on. I love the way I feel now and how I look. Losing the weight is the best thing I ever did, I feel much healthier. I hope the promise I made my parents has helped me to live a long, healthy le – it’s given me more of a fighting chance than I ever had.” For years, Sharon was refused the back tattoo she had always dreamed of getting because of her size. But she has built up the bodywork over the years, getting a little bit done each time she lost a bit more weight.    Now the mum is determined to send an empowering message to her two children - Rebecca, , and Alex,  - claiming time spent with them is more important than body image. And while doctors have told her two stone of her current weight is excess skin from when she was much larger, she isn’t bothered about having it removed. Sharon said: My husband has been an amazing support, heaposs pushed me all the way and now he jokes that heaposs got a new we and that thereaposs a lot more room in the bed, but he actually met me when I was at my biggest.

She was reportedly snatched by a man and woman who it is claimed were hiding from police and she ended up in an orphanage before her foster parents adopted her.    But it was not until she met her boyfriend, Ilya Kryukov, , who helped to search for her parents, that the family was finally brought back together. Heartwarming pictures show her mother and father breaking down in tears as they meet their long-lost daughter. A DNA test has now proved that she is the daughter of Viktor and Lyudmila Moiseenko - and her has father “begged her forgiveness” for losing her.    Her parents, now in their late s, searched frantically for their lost child at the time, as did local police, but they ended up under suspicion of killing the girl. As recently as  when police reopened the case, they underwent lie detector tests which they both passed. It remains unclear how Yulia got from Asipovichy to Ryazan, except she has a memory of a train journey. A couple - who possibly kidnapped the lost girl - were believed to have been involved. “I do believe it’s all true now,” said Yulia after finding and hugging her real parents. “It was proved by a DNA test, but it was clear even before, we are so much alike, as soon as we saw the photographs of each other. Nobody had any doubts – we are one family.    I found not only my mother and father in Belarus, but also brother Dmitry and elder sister Nadezhda . Yulia still lives in Ryazan where she was found on a railway siding in . It is  miles from Asipovichy where she was lost. Her biological mother Lyudmila said: “Twenty years is like a whole le, but we never lost hope, we believed – and so we found each other. The emotional reunion was held in a police station in Marjina Horka settlement. “We were all in tears,” said Yulia. “We could not even talk, we only cried and hugged each other.    “My parents have told me that they were searching for me for a long time, that they believed they would find me one day. “My mother could not stop hugging me, she made me sit on her lap asI was a little girl. “We were chatting till  am, and then Ilya and I had to go back to Russia – my daughter was waiting for me.” Yulia said the police sent her to an orphanage after a fruitless search in Russia for her family. She was given up for adoption to foster parents Irina and Oleg who have always wanted a daughter.

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now. It’s called ‘The Luckiest Man Alive’ and I’m also working on the memoirs. vw, px\"  “I am thinking of calling that ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ after the Arctic Monkeys. I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that. I am not retiring, not yet and not in the foreseeable future.”John has the tour to contend with first and is also lining up some television work.And at the age of  there is definitely no holding him back. So look out for many more tours to come from the man who wants to be yours."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d6941a6f24a31.90422623.jpg ","title":"blether tayside footballer ian receives telegram from the queen","story":"Thursday past saw one of Tayside’s best-known football figures exchange correspondence with royalty.August  was celebrated by Ian and Margaret Cochrane and their family as it was their golden wedding and, as such, received the customary telegram from The Queen.I first came across Ian many decades agowhen he was in charge of Menzieshill Boys Club.A few years later, he stepped up to the juniors with new club Hydro Dynamo FC.

The adjacent Maritime House, which was once the home of travel firm DPL, is being converted into  new flats.No concrete plans for Custom House will be on the table until a new buyer for the property is found.However, the building could appeal to a property developer looking to create more homes in the area, rather than a rival hotelier."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/04/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-2-846x564.jpg ","title":"va dundee makes time magazines worlds greatest places to visit in 2019 list","story":"The VA Dundee has been included in Time magazine#s list of the world#s greatest places to visit in .The Kengo Kuma-designed museum has been included in the #to visit# section of the list, alongside other destinations including Teatro Galli in Rimini and The Shed in New York City.mdash VisitScotland NewsAugust , Sitting on Dundee#s Waterfront, the museum opened in September  and has brought a massive influx of tourists to the city.In the Time article, writer Samantha Cooney said: #The famed Victoria  Albert design museum has opened its first ever location outside of London in an unexpected place: Dundee, a quiet city on the coast of Scotland.#It’s the cornerstone of a more than  billion plan to revitalize the city, a onetime industrial powerhouse now struggling with high unemployment. vw, px\"  #Renowned architect Kengo Kuma designed the modern building, which sits on the Dundee waterfront, to mimic Scotland’s iconic clfs.Can#t believe we#re on a TIME magazine cover! #covergirl💁‍♀️What a beautul illustration @PGreenwoodDraws 🥰 https:t.co JAIXcUEMu pic HeHMfIzgMmdash VA DundeeAugust , #The free museum—the first in Scotland for design—opened in September  and tells the story of the country’s design history, with highlights including Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s Oak Room.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"red star take derby spoils","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRed Star welcomed local rivals Tarbert to the joint campus, and it was the Lochgilphead side who maintained their place at the top of the group thanks to a Stuart MacLean goal early in the second half.The first half of the game on Saturday August  began at a typically fast pace as you might expect from a derby clash-  but both sides were limited to efforts from long range which goalkeepers John Martin and Ally Lewis dealt with relative ease.The home side started to enjoy more possession as the first half progressed but were finding the well-organised Tarbert defence dficult to breach and were limited to efforts from distance which failed to trouble Martin in the Dookers goal.Star came out quicker at the start of the second half and looked to play at a much higher tempo. The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

Iain sensibly played short of the burn while Bruce had no option but to drive, splitting the fairway in the process leaving a  yard shot to the green. Iain#s second shot came up a bit short leaving him a dficult up and down, and the drama continued as Bruce almost holed his second shot to leave a tap in birdie. With nerves of steel, Iain chipped on to four feet and duly rolled in the putt for a well deserved victory of the Sam Andrews trophy.This was Iain#s first championship victory and in his acceptance speech he told the crowd of his delight at winning while complimenting the sterling work done on the course by Graham Prentice, John MacNab and Duncan Johnstone.Iain swept the boards, also winning the nett and senior championship at the same time.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream.

headquarters.Members of the union Unite are striking due to changes to their employment terms and conditions.Road workers descended on the local authority on the morning of Thursday August , to coincide with a full council meeting, and waved flags, shouted slogans and played lsquoMoney Money Moneyrsquo by ABBA on a PA system.Speaking at the demonstration, Willie Thomson, a regional industrial organiser for Unite, said that the dispute could risk the regionrsquos winter maintenance programme.He said: ldquoThe reason why the men are taking action is basically a refusal from Scottish Borders Council to respect the terms and conditions of their employment.ldquoThey have had changes imposed on them that will cost them poundrsquos, and they are not willing to have that done to them.ldquoThe reason they are striking is to send a strong message that the council needs to get back round the table and reach an agreement with the workers.ldquoThe people of the Scottish Borders need to be aware that the council is risking their winter maintenance service.ldquoDuring the winter maintenance service members do a lot of extra hours to keep up with the extra demand.ldquoWersquore now in a position where members will be withdrawing that programme.ldquoThat work is done a voluntary basis and the good will that is required to do that is in short supply.Currently, summer standby for Scottish Borders Councilrsquos road workers is voluntary, but council chiefs are trying to make this mandatory, in line with other sections of the council.Earlier this year, Scottish Borders Council notied the unions that not enforcing the same terms and conditions across the whole council could leave the local authority open to gender pay discrimination claims, as the mainly male roads section of the council is not required to be on standby over the summer, whereas the mainly female care home staff are.Summer standby payment for roads workers is currently pound., albeit it on a voluntary basis, and Scottish Borders Council is offering to up this to pound as long as it becomes mandatory.The two main unions which represent road workers at Scottish Borders Council, Unite and Unison, have been in discussion with the council ever since it informed employees that the terms and conditions would change.However, the talks with Unite broke down, and .% of the unionrsquos members who voted in an industrial ballot voted for strike action. The turn out was %.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos chief executive Tracey Logan,said: ldquoThe council has not changed terms and conditions for this staff group, nor have we failed to consult the trade unions or the staff affected.ldquoIn fact, we discovered some months ago that a small number of staff in this section had been claiming a higher rate of overtime than they were entitled to under the agreed terms and conditions.ldquoThey were also claiming for time to travel to work when working weekend overtime, which again is not in line with the agreement in place.ldquoGiven that Unite agreed to these terms and conditions, I am surprised and disappointed that they now want some of their members to be given more favourable pay rates than others, and for this small group be able to claim additional allowances that their other members cannot.ldquoIt is a principle of fairness and equality for staff across the whole workforce and one which I would expect Unite as representatives of staff to uphold and commit to."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-bar-cream-crop-scottish-cuisine","story":"A BAR and restaurant is the toast of Selkirk after winning the Best Scottish Cuisine title at Food Awards Scotland .The celebration of the countrys best restaurants, takeaways, pubs, hotel restaurants, cafes and bistros was held last week in Glasgow.Within the restaurant category it was the The Fleece Bar  Kitchen which was announced as cream of the crop when it comes to presenting Scottish cuisine.Trevor and Tracey Ward, who have owned the historic Selkirk inn since , were delighted with the latest accolade.Tracey told us: \"Wersquore absolutely delighted to have been awarded this accolade which celebrates the very best Scotland has to offer in the hospitality industry.\"To win the category of Best Scottish Cuisine when wersquore a family run restaurant situated in a small Borders town, is testament to the commitment and focus of our staff and the support we have from our customers and the community.\"There were some great, long established restaurants in our category and for us to have come out on top was a welcome surprise!Over the past three years the Wards, along with trainee chef son Ryan, have been rewarded with a regular stream of five-star reviews from delighted customers.And the awards shelf is filling up as quickly as their restaurant diary.Another Borders establishment which was also honoured last week at the Food Awards Scotland was Stewarts Cafe Bistro in Jedburgh.The High Street business was named as the regional Cafe Bistro winner.Creative Oceanic has been organising and hosting the awards for the past six years.CEO Irfan Younis told us: ldquoCongratulations to all winners and finalists at the sixth Food Awards Scotland .\"We welcomed and rewarded some of the best in the Scottish food industry who serve us up some of the tastiest food, enhance our culture, deliver top quality customer service and provide us with some of the best banter around.

Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset.

One way we can fight back against ecological collapse is to have wilder, unmown, unsprayed spaces around us.

When the corn was eventually gathered in early September, it is said decaying corpses were discovered. They had lain in the fields since August , a day of barbaric infamy in Tranentrsquos history. The dead were victims of the Tranent Massacre, and one of the bodies may have been that of Jackie Crookston or Crookstone.I say lsquomayrsquo for there is ironically so little known about this well-known woman. A statue by David Annand of Jackie on Tranent High Street shows her beating her drum with a clenched fist, defiantly leading the protest against the Militia Act. The plaque by the statue calls her a ldquoresolute woman who joined the protest, and states she was one of those killed by the cavalry.Her heroic reputation is well established in local lore. The th-century historian John Martine called her ldquoa Tranent virago. This word describes a woman of brave, fearless qualities, but it has a sting in its tail. It can also be used to mean a woman who has overstepped her mark, broken cultural rules in relation to her role as defined by gender.And by leading the protest against the Militia Act she most certainly did this.Another th-century historian and collector of traditions, P. MrsquoNeill, was clear on her role: ldquoJackie indeed was the prime mover in the whole affair, he states.We have accounts of her beating her drum and leading the protest with chants of ldquonae militia. She is said to have threatened a captain of the cavalry and declared defiantly that ldquoshe didna care a pin though she were cut in halves, she wad hae nae militia. Another account has her telling a member of the yeomanry to leave or she would ldquothraw his neck, at which he duly rode off.If these accounts are true, she was indeed resolute on that day in defending her family, her neighbours and her community. Jackie was not the only woman on the streets that day, for women took a leading role in defending their families. But she was the most prominent, it seems.The Militia Act aimed to conscript young men into a militia by means of a ballot. It was resisted for a number of reasons, but for the poverty-stricken mining and farming communities of Tranent and the surrounding area, it was seen as an imposition which would take young men of working age away and potentially cripple their families economically.There is no space here to recount the details of the massacre, but much of what happened on that day remains hidden behind a mist of cover-up and official indference.And somewhere in the bloody carnage of August , , Jackie Crookston was killed, along with many others. Yet despite her leading role, her name was not included in the original list of people killed. Eleven deaths were recorded, but no mention of Jackie. ldquoHow her death escaped recording is dficult to explain, reflected P. MrsquoNeill in his book Tranent and its Surroundings.Perhaps an explanation can be found in an eyewitness account written immediately after the massacre. It was a letter from Archibald Roger to his we in Edinburgh.It begins: ldquoDear we, this comes to acquaint you that you need not weary for my ing home, for my sister is to be buried this afternoon at four orsquoclock, and I cannot come away till I see her decently interred. I am sorry to inform you of the cruelties that were committed here yesterday there were six persons shot dead on the spot, of which my sister was onehellip the number of wounded is not yet ascertained, but I am just now informed that  dead corpses were this morning found in the corn-fields and it is not known how many more may be found when the corn is cut.Was Jackie one of those lying undiscovered in a field  It seems so by some accounts. Is that why her death was not on the list  Sandy Mullay in his book The Tranent Massacre says she was shot in the streets, but there is also a tradition which states her body was found well away from Tranent much later in a field, with stab as well as gunshot wounds.Was she initially wounded and then a victim of later retribution  Was she hunted down in an unrecorded atrocity because of her role as ring leader, and a woman who didnrsquot know her place  She will have been easy to identy because of her prominence in the protest.Her death, just like her le, is unrecorded by history. Despite her leadership in the events, she was a woman and she was poor, and history lacks interest in such characters. A tax on the registration of births and deaths at this time meant many poor people lived and died unregistered even in parish records.So who was Jackie  We know she was born in Gladsmuir in June  and was a mother. Perhaps not all her children were registered because of the tax, but it seems she had at least four surviving at the time of the massacre.

So the teammade a conscious decision to use all the meat from the carcase, specically the prime cuts, in thesausages and burgers and it has made a huge dference to the taste and succulence of the product. Why not have an everyday product with the best ingredients The pork meat is available all year round giving customers a steady supply of their staple shopping and this is then boosted with seasonal lamb, game and beef.

Other types of so-called surface waves decay more quickly and travel in multiple directions.Dr Tom Mackay, of the University of Edinburghrsquos School of Mathematics, who jointly led the study, said: ldquoDyakonov-Voigt waves represent a step forward in our understanding of how light interacts with complex materials, and offer opportunities for a range of technological advancements.The team identied the wavesrsquo unique properties using mathematical models that incorporated equations developed by Maxwell.Since the mid-s, research on how light interacts with crystals has built on the work of the physicist, who helped to lay the foundations for fields such as special relativity and quantum mechanics.Born in , Maxwell was the son of an Edinburgh advocate.When Maxwell was a child, the family moved to Dumfriesshire when they inherited Middlebie Estate.One early tutor is said to have claimed that he was slow at learning, however he went on to study at the Edinburgh Academy, with his first scientic paper being published at the age of .He then went on to the University of Edinburgh and later Cambridge, where he was presented with the prestigious Smithrsquos Prize.In , Maxwell was elected to a fellowship at Trinity College, but he chose toto Scotland sue to his Fatherrsquos ill-health.He later developed his theory of electromagnetism, which showed that light was electromagnetic radiation. The theory is considered to have paved the way for both quantum mechanics and Einsteinrsquos theory of special relativity.Maxwell died in  after developing abdominal cancer, the disease which had killed his mother  years earlier.The Dyakonov-Voigt study, published in the Royal Societyrsquos physical sciences research journal, was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the US National Science Foundation."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10363962.jpg?type=article-full","title":"government-loses-working-majority-ex-minister-defects-lib-dems","story":"The pro-remain Bracknell MP, made his move in the House of Commons by walking across the chamber to the Lib Dem benches flanked by two of his new colleagues.It means that opposition MPs now outnumber the Conservative and DUP ranks by one solitary MP.

This was believed to be a reference to Dominic Cummings, the former Leave campaign chief, who is now Mr Johnsonrsquos de facto chief of staff.After being endorsed by his Surrey constituency as their next election candidate, Mr Hammond warned Tory HQ that it would be the ldquofight of a letimeit tried to remove the party whip from him.A Downing St source responded to the former Chancellorrsquos remarks by describing them as an ldquohysterical meltdown\"."},{"url":null,"title":"exhibition-reveal-work-golden-age-horology","story":"In candlelit workshops using precious metals and the cutting-edge technology of the age, they brought time to le in watches and clocks that became status symbols for the rich and showcased their remarkable technical skills.Now the art and skill of the earliest clock and watchmakers will be celebrated in an exhibition which draws together a prized collection of dazzling timepieces featuring intricately engraved patterns and inscriptions, grand clocks and elegant designs with such complex workings that itrsquos hard to believe they are four centuries old and still working.The exquisite timepieces come from the private collection of Dr John C Taylor ndash a prolic inventor whose creations include a thermostat control for use with electric kettles, a device which is reckoned to be used more than a billion times a day around the world.Among the most fascinating pieces in the exhibition, The Luxury of Time: Clocks from  to , will be two highly decorated watches made by Fe-born pioneering watchmaker David Ramsay, Royal Clockmaker to King James VI and the first master of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, founded in .One is a striking silver gilt-metal astronomical watch dating from around  and featuring a detailed engraving of the King which, given Ramsayrsquos royal connection, is thought to have been presented to a loyal follower as a sign of the monarchrsquos deep affection.As well as telling the time, the watch features a zodiac clock and shows the phases of the Moon.The other, an intricately engraved oval watch, features a backplate bearing the words ldquoDavid Ramsay Scotus me fecit, reflecting the makerrsquos pride in his Scottish heritage.According to Dr Tacye Phillipson, senior curator of science at National Museums Scotland, the exhibition will highlight the skill of early watch and clockmakers, who combined scientic understanding of the passage of time and its connection to the universe with an eye for design and undeniable skill.She said: ldquoOne thing that stands out is how heavily engraved some of the watches are. They really do have that lsquoblingrsquo factor. ldquoThese were watches that were not made to be hidden away in a pocket.ldquoThey were worn as jewellery ndash rather like todayrsquos watches.ldquoThe exhibition challenges our assumptions about how clocks and watches were once used.It will include  objects which demonstrate the early age of British clock and watchmaking, when owning a timepiece made of precious metal was considered the ultimate status symbol and only affordable for the very rich.Before the th century, clock and watchmaking was primarily the domain of mainland European makers, many of whom had fled to Britain to escape religious persecution.Ramsay initially worked as a goldsmith in St Andrews before learning the art of watch and clockmaking in France.He is said to have been summoned to London by James VI, where he was appointed Page of the Bedchamber and Groom of the Privy Chamber, as well as Keeper of all His Majestyrsquos Clocks and Watches.ldquoIt appears that a mixture of his clockmaking skills and the politics of James VI looking to surround himself with Scots led to his appointment as Page of the Bedchamber, said Dr Phillipson.ldquoThe job description suggests rather menial work but it was a hugely important political role and meant he had direct access to the King.ldquoWhenever he wanted to escape his Privy Council, he would go to his bedchamber, where he surrounded himself with Scots.While th-century watch and clockmakers often worked in silver and gold, most pieces were melted down and their cases recycled, meaning that precious few remain from the era.The exhibition, which will open at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh early next month, will focus on how the horologistrsquos skill and art developed, telling the story of the scientic and technical advances during periods of extreme turmoil.Examples range from early wrought iron clocks made by blacksmiths to the invention of the pendulum clock and the balance spring which improved accuracy to within a few seconds a day.It will also spotlight some of the collaborations between important makers, and the first example of mass-produced watches, made in the early th century by Thomas Tompion, the ldquoFather of English Clockmaking, who used subcontractors to make the parts and movements of his watches.They were then completed in his workshop by a team of apprentices, with around , eventually rolling off his production line.Despite their grand age, most of the timepieces in the display are in working order and there are plans to show some in operation at selected periods during the exhibition.Dr Taylor is said to have become fascinated with watches while watching his father take one apart and rebuild it at the family dining table.He conceived and funded several public clocks, including the Corpus Clock on the outside of the Taylor Library at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge University, which has no hands or numerals and instead shows the time by opening gaps in the clock face.Dr Phillipson said: ldquoClocks and watches were the first manufactured mechanical objects and itrsquos great to show some early examples in the National Museum of Scotland. ldquoThe innovation produced by these wonderful articles initiated the necessity to protect the intellectual property behind their development ndash something that we take for granted today."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-launches-bid-get-drivers-take-bus","story":"The First Minister made a ldquoScottish green deal the centrepiece of her annual legislative programme at Holyrood as she ramped up steps to tackle the worldrsquos climate emergency.The measures are intended to end Scotlandrsquos net contribution to carbon emissions by  by making green goals an integral part of public spending and the economy.ldquoResponding to climate change is not simply a moral obligation, it is also an economic and social opportunity, Ms Sturgeon told MSPs.The First Minister also said she intended to ask the UK Government for the power to hold a second independence referendum within months, prompting opposition claims she was neglecting government to pursue her constitutional obsession.The green reforms include a ldquostep change investment in priority bus lanes to speed up public transport and convince commuters to leave their cars at home.The five-year poundm plan will start with parts of the motorway network around Glasgow being allocated to ldquohigh occupancy vehicles.Scotlandrsquos rail network will also be ldquodecarbonised by , with electric trains replacing the last diesels, and work undertaken on battery and hydrogen-powered engines.An extra poundm will help buyers of ultra-low emission vehicles, while measures to phase out all new diesel and petrol cars by , such as installing electric charge points, continue apace.From , traditional gas boilers will be banned in new-build homes, which will be required to use ldquorenewable or low carbon heat to help deliver zero-carbon buildings.The pound billion Scottish National Investment Bank, designed to give long-term loans to expanding businesses, will have the move to net zero carbon emissions as its ldquoprimary mission.Businesses will be incentivised to reduce carbon emissions and district and communal heating systems will be encouraged.Other legislation will allow charges on single-use coffee cups.The  bills in the Programme for Government - also included measures to tackle hate crime, empower councils to levy a ldquotourist tax, deliver an overdue reform of defamation law and create a new system for compensating victims of historic sexual abuse in care homes.Other announcements included the acceleration of a new devolved benefit intended to lt , children out of relative poverty.The pound-a-week payment for low-income families will be brought forward from early  to December  for under-s, and from  to  for all other children under .An extra poundm will be spent to help tackle Scotlandrsquos record drug deaths, which hit , last year.In the wake of the delayed opening of the Edinburgh Sick Kids hospital, the power of health boards to oversee large projects will be diluted.A new national body will instead be given responsibility for the oversight of the design, construction and maintenance of major infrastructuredevelopments in NHS Scotland.The first wave of a poundbn investment programme in schools building is expected to start with Woodmill High School in Dunfermline after it was gutted by fire last month.However, it was the green measures, many long-term, which Ms Sturgeon emphasised.She said: ldquoThis Programme for Government will put health, prosperity and wellbeing at its heart and will reinforce Scotlandrsquos place as a dynamic, open, innovative economy.ldquoEarlier this year, I acknowledgedthat Scotland - like the rest of the world - faces a climate emergency.ldquoWe are now committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by  at the latest - earlier than any other UK nation. This programme is an important part of our response to the climate emergency, containing measures which will reduce emissions while supporting sustainable and inclusive growth.ldquoIt sets out actions which will make a dference for years to come. It meets the challenges of the future, while staying true to our enduring values.The Scottish Greens said the programme was a ldquocheap imitation of their own plans for a new Green Deal to put carbon reduction at the heart of Scotlandrsquos economy.MSP Patrick Harvie said: ldquoMs Sturgeonrsquos version lacks the ambition, scale and courage required of an emergency response.ldquoWe welcome her adoption of the idea that the Scottish Investment Bank should prioritise the climate emergency, but the funding is limited.ldquoThis is not system change. The Scottish Government also seem infatuated with consumer choice and unproven technologies that apparently promise a quick fix - carbon capture and storage, electric aeroplanes and hydrogen trains ndash yet the technology we need to solve the climate crisis is already here.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said he welcomed climate change being ldquowoven into every aspect of government.Dr Richard Dixon of Friends of the Earth Scotland said: ldquoThis package includes some very welcome commitments but is not nearly enough to address the desperate climate emergency the world is facing.ldquoThe obvious contradiction at the heart of this Programme is its commitment to some new measures in transport, heating and agriculture while continuing to back the offshore oil and gas industry to keep on drilling and destroying our climate.David Liddell, CEO of the Scottish Drugs Forum, said the pound extra for treatment services would be welcomed across the drugs field.He said: ldquoFor decades drug treatment services have operated as Cinderella services. We look forward to seeing this money invested and used to drive improvement in services in terms of access and retention that follows the evidence base.John Dickie, Director of the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, said: ldquoToo many families are struggling now to simply provide the basic necessities for their children so itrsquos great that introduction of the new Scottish Child Payment is being brought forward. Itrsquos now vital that everything possible is done to promote take up.Dr Liz Cameron, chief executive of Scottish Chambers of Commerce, welcomed the pledge to improve the bus network, but said a tourist tax would be ldquomet with caution by businesses across Scotland.She said: ldquoMany of Scotlandrsquos communities depend on our world-leading tourism and hospitality sector.

It is like stumbling on an oasis in a desert, a refreshing, invigorating, restorative immersion in a piece of remarkable, thoughtful and truly innovative fiction. Too many headline-grabbing novels are dull and predictable, enervating rather than enjoyable, derivative when they should be daring. Such tedious stuff makes you forget that the original meaning of the word novel was something dferent, unique, and new.Thankfully the Booker  has recognised a work of exceptional talent. Its presence on the shortlist adds lustre to a prize that has been dogged over the years by accusations of mediocrity and popularism, charges that last yearrsquos winner, Milkman by Anna Burns, helped to refute. Ellmannrsquos fellow shortlistees are prestigious, including Margaret Atwood and Salman Rushdie, both of whom have won before, along with El Shafak, second only to Orhan Pamuk in Turkey for international acclaim, British writer Bernadine Eisto, and the Nigerian Chigozie Obioma, shortlisted for his second novel, as he was with his first.The competition is stf, but already statistics are being trotted out: were it to win, Ducks, Newburyport would be the longest to prevail in the historyrsquos prize, beating even Eleanor Cattonrsquos doorstopper, The Luminaries, by more than  pages. Apart from their size, however, these two novels are poles apart. There is nothing conventional about Ducks, Newburyport. Indeed, Ellmannrsquos literary credentials can be traced back to James Joyce, the exemplar of stream of consciousness, where the reader has to surrender themselves to the flow, trusting the author to keep their head above water until they reach their destination. In the fluidity of Ellmannrsquos prose therersquos an echo of Henry James, with his sharp and self-conscious interrogation of America. Therersquos a nod to Virginia Woolf too, but Ellmannrsquos wit and acerbity, her scorching political lens, are all her own.The direction her style has taken is perhaps no surprise. Ellmannrsquos late father Richard was a world-renowned expert on Oscar Wilde and Yeats, but above all on James Joyce. His biography of the myopic Dublin genius has never been surpassed, remaining one of the most acclaimed literary biographies of the last century. The linguistic poetry and emotional range of Joyce, who must have been an invisible but constant presence in the Ellmann household, seems to have got under his daughterrsquos skin at a formative age.The announcement of the Booker Prize next month, on October , will mark  years to the day since its only Scottish winner, James Kelman, took the prize in  with How Late It Was, How Late. This was a highly contentious choice, not just because of its interior monologue narration, but also its liberal use of the F-word, which horried one uptight judge. The controversy it sparked has never been forgotten. These days, though, you canrsquot help thinking the title sounds like a lament for the lapse of time between Kelmanrsquos success and that of anyone  living north of the Border.There is no doubting Kelmanrsquos status as one of our finest novelists. Along with Alasdair Gray, he is an obvious contender for a Nobel Prize, though the chances of that idiosyncratic telescopersquos lens turning in this direction seem slim. Unlike many others, winning the Booker did not make Kelman rich or famous. It did, however, raise his profile internationally, and set a benchmark for those keen to add something memorable to the literary cairn.Ducks, Newburyport certainly does that. Other than in their tireless search for a mesmerising and distinctive way of expressing themselves, at first glance there is little obvious common ground between this pair. It is only when you read their books and recognise their seemingly effortless brilliance that you realise how similar, and rare, they are.In the acknowledgements at the end of Ducks, Newburyport, Ellmann thanks ldquoEdinburgh City Council for my Saltire card, a dandy aid to the impecunious. Itrsquos a cheerful reminder that unless yoursquore a bestseller, the literary le is not deluxe. Yet listening to the naturalness of her narratorrsquos voice, and the stories she tells, makes you grateful that the writerrsquos feet are firmly on the ground, be it a New Town pavement, No.  bus, or mid-west America, where the future is unfolding fast."},{"url":null,"title":"rosemary-goring-late-indeed-can-rejoice-booker-choice","story":"Why the excitement  Well, where to begin  Ellmann, who lives in Edinburgh with her husband Todd McEwen, also a writer, is one of the most undeservedly under-appreciated novelists of our times.

Such tedious stuff makes you forget that the original meaning of the word novel was something dferent, unique, and new.Thankfully the Booker  has recognised a work of exceptional talent. Its presence on the shortlist adds lustre to a prize that has been dogged over the years by accusations of mediocrity and popularism, charges that last yearrsquos winner, Milkman by Anna Burns, helped to refute. Ellmannrsquos fellow shortlistees are prestigious, including Margaret Atwood and Salman Rushdie, both of whom have won before, along with El Shafak, second only to Orhan Pamuk in Turkey for international acclaim, British writer Bernadine Eisto, and the Nigerian Chigozie Obioma, shortlisted for his second novel, as he was with his first.The competition is stf, but already statistics are being trotted out: were it to win, Ducks, Newburyport would be the longest to prevail in the historyrsquos prize, beating even Eleanor Cattonrsquos doorstopper, The Luminaries, by more than  pages. Apart from their size, however, these two novels are poles apart. There is nothing conventional about Ducks, Newburyport. Indeed, Ellmannrsquos literary credentials can be traced back to James Joyce, the exemplar of stream of consciousness, where the reader has to surrender themselves to the flow, trusting the author to keep their head above water until they reach their destination. In the fluidity of Ellmannrsquos prose therersquos an echo of Henry James, with his sharp and self-conscious interrogation of America. Therersquos a nod to Virginia Woolf too, but Ellmannrsquos wit and acerbity, her scorching political lens, are all her own.The direction her style has taken is perhaps no surprise. Ellmannrsquos late father Richard was a world-renowned expert on Oscar Wilde and Yeats, but above all on James Joyce. His biography of the myopic Dublin genius has never been surpassed, remaining one of the most acclaimed literary biographies of the last century. The linguistic poetry and emotional range of Joyce, who must have been an invisible but constant presence in the Ellmann household, seems to have got under his daughterrsquos skin at a formative age.The announcement of the Booker Prize next month, on October , will mark  years to the day since its only Scottish winner, James Kelman, took the prize in  with How Late It Was, How Late. This was a highly contentious choice, not just because of its interior monologue narration, but also its liberal use of the F-word, which horried one uptight judge. The controversy it sparked has never been forgotten. These days, though, you canrsquot help thinking the title sounds like a lament for the lapse of time between Kelmanrsquos success and that of anyone  living north of the Border.There is no doubting Kelmanrsquos status as one of our finest novelists. Along with Alasdair Gray, he is an obvious contender for a Nobel Prize, though the chances of that idiosyncratic telescopersquos lens turning in this direction seem slim. Unlike many others, winning the Booker did not make Kelman rich or famous. It did, however, raise his profile internationally, and set a benchmark for those keen to add something memorable to the literary cairn.Ducks, Newburyport certainly does that. Other than in their tireless search for a mesmerising and distinctive way of expressing themselves, at first glance there is little obvious common ground between this pair. It is only when you read their books and recognise their seemingly effortless brilliance that you realise how similar, and rare, they are.In the acknowledgements at the end of Ducks, Newburyport, Ellmann thanks ldquoEdinburgh City Council for my Saltire card, a dandy aid to the impecunious. Itrsquos a cheerful reminder that unless yoursquore a bestseller, the literary le is not deluxe. Yet listening to the naturalness of her narratorrsquos voice, and the stories she tells, makes you grateful that the writerrsquos feet are firmly on the ground, be it a New Town pavement, No.  bus, or mid-west America, where the future is unfolding fast."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10365516.jpg?type=article-full","title":"jacob-rees-mogg-criticised-lying-down-key-brexit-debate","story":"The Leader of the Housewas seen reclining in the chamber, at times with his eyes closed, as MPs discussed plans to take control of the Commons agenda and pass legislation which would prevent a no-deal Brexit on October .Jacob was just showing us what Brexit will do to our economy. #StopBrexit pic ABEEBmdash Jo SwinsonSeptember , As a working class bloke brought up on a council estate in #Hull I always feel enormous pride and gratitude when I go into the chamber of the House of Commons to represent east #Hull.

Its CEO is Shona McLennan, who explains that like many minority languages Gaelic has been in decline, but the mission of Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig is to promote Gaelic language, Gaelic education, and Gaelic culture with a view to reinvigorating the language.ldquoOne of the most effective ways to do this is to provide education in the medium of the language, says Shona. ldquoAlongside education in the language, pupils also need opportunities to use it outside of the classroom. You need activity around the learning such as sports activities, arts and music.As Jim Whannel, Board Member of Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig and Oraidiche Teaching Fellowat the University of Edinburgh, explains, parents in Scotland are fortunate to have an education system where, from Primary One, they can choose education through the medium of Gaelic or the medium of English.ldquoItrsquos a choice that is available in a large number of authorities, he says. ldquoWhen parents make the choice of the Gaelic medium, they will educate a child in two languages. Itrsquos not an issuethe family doesnt have Gaelic, because theres an immersion programme and something in region of % of the children being taught in the Gaelic medium in Glasgow and Edinburgh come from homes where it isnrsquot spoken.There is also criticism levelled that Gaelic learning and education is for the middle-classes, the elite. Again, the figures extinguish that myth.ldquoThe Glasgow Gaelic School Sgoil Ghagraveidhlig Ghlaschu has a very mixed intake, adds Shona McLennan. ldquoIt serves a very broad community in the city. Itrsquos also one of the highest performing state schools in Scotland.Monolingualism isnrsquot the norm across most of the world, and the benefits of being bilingual or multilingual are well-known , but what is emerging is the solid cognitive benefits to learning other languages, but more importantly using other languages.Thomas Bak is a Reader in Psychology at the University of Edinburgh, with particular interest in the interaction between bilingualism and cognitive s, particularly in diseases such as dementia or stroke.Among the many studies he has conducted was one to test whether there can be improvement in cognitiveby learning a new language.ldquoWe needed to test before and after, he says. ldquoWe compared those learning a language with those learning another subject such as history. We looked at attention switching, counting numbers up and down and after a year there was no dferent but after four years there was a marked dference, with the language students performing better.Thomas also saw this in intensive language courses, when he went to the Gaelic college on Skye, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig and tested students at the beginning and end of the course.ldquoWe saw that one week is enough to improve performance, but it needs to be maintained by five or more hours a week in practice using the language. Those who didnrsquot maintain it, went back to their original performance.Thomas adds that the language itself is irrelevant. ldquoWhat is relevant to Gaelic, however, is that the cognitive advantages are not dependent on the number of speakers. One argument commonly used against Gaelic. Is that itrsquos a small language and most speak English anyway.ldquoIf we look at the analogy of going to the gym, that does us good. Thatrsquos learning the language. However,we drive there rather than cycle or walk, it does us less good. The walking and cycling are using that language.Jim Whannel sees bilingualism as an opportunity to have a more global view and rather than Gaelic medium education being insular, itrsquos actually English medium education which is more closed off.ldquoIn Scotland we have this fantastic opportunity to validate and promote an indigenous culture along with English language culture.Of course there are benefits the learning the language without that immersion. The increased awareness of the language from a young age and understanding can often translate into a desire to carry on and learn more as an adult.As Shona McLennan explains there are still challenges. ldquoLike teaching in English-medium there is a shortage of teachers. We also need to expand the curriculum, so that that pupils who come through Gaelic-medium in primary arenrsquot restricted in subject choices when they come to secondary.ldquoThere are so many benefits but the Gaelic language is a fundamentally important part of Scotlandrsquos culture and heritage."},{"url":null,"title":"most of us favour glass being included in deposit return scheme","story":"The vast majority of people in Scotland say that glass should be included in the p Deposit Return Scheme, according to new figures from Zero Waste Scotland.A YouGov survey commissioned by Zero Waste Scotland shows that  per cent of people in Scotland say glass bottles should be in the scheme.

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

The devices were first introduced in Tayside in June this year and they were subsequently introduced in the North East in July.The mobiles will provide apps enabling officers carry out checks and file crime reports. Officers will also be able to type statements directly to the device through the use of its digital notebookPronto which will obtain an electronic signature from victims and witnesses.Chief Superintendent George Macdonald, Highland and Islands isional commander, said: #The introduction of mobile technology is a major milestone which will positively enhance the operational policing approach in the Highland and Islands.#Over the last two years, we have seen a signicant investment and upgrade in our IT systems to enable us to take advantage of technology.#Given the geography of the area, officers do incur signicant travel time between calls and their stations, the mobile device will allow officers to be more visible in the community, spend more time on patrol and hopefully be more accessible within the areas they serve.#Members of the public will see police officers operating their mobile device in public areas. It is important they understand they are not using their personal telephone and that they are working, but be reassured they will always be available to offer help, advice or assistanceneeded.#Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Humza Yousaf  is pleased that the Scottish Government has been able to help Police Scotland invest in new mobile technology, which he believes will enable officers to work in the heart of Scotland’s communities, providing reassurance and increasing their visibility.“This technology is enabling officers to become even more agile and responsive, ensuring the service is better-equipped to meet the modern-day demands upon it,# he said.#Being able to access information at their fingertips will improve the ability of officers in the Highlands and Islands to react promptly to a range of issues they encounter, enhancing the amount of time available to spend in the heart of their communities and keeping people safe.”Susan Deacon, Chair of the Scottish Police Authorityfeels that this is an important and much needed step forward.#The introduction of mobile working will bring real benefits to the police and the public and will make the police service more responsive, visible and efficient,# she explained.#Continued investment in technology is vital to ensure that policing in Scotland keeps pace with changing needs and demands. Communities across Scotland will be better protected as a result of these changes.#The £million Mobile Working Project which was part funded by the Scottish Government’s capital budget allocation will see approximately , of Police Scotland’s unormed officers issued with mobile devices by spring .The devices will be further enhanced over time with the addition of future policing applications, including national systems as they become available.Last year, Police Scotland produced a business case for a major investment in digital, data and ICT over  years to modernise the service. The proposed investment would also generate savings and public service improvements for the wider criminal justice system justice system.David Wallace, BT’s public sector director in Scotland and chair of the BT board in Scotland, said: “We’re pleased to be leading this project, bringing in our EE mobile network – the largest G network in the UK – and our unrivalled resources to help Police Scotland transform the way they work.“By helping our customers take advantage of BT’s investments in innovations and networking, including our launch of G in Scotland, we’ll see opportunities we couldn’t imagine ten years ago come into our lives.”Norman Dixon, Motorola Solutions# Account Director for Scotland added: “The Pronto mobile application replaces the paper notebook and modernises police workflows by giving them access to databases and tools on their mobile device on the beat. It is a world-leading mobile solution for policing.

Craig Clouston and Callan Jessiman were tasked with anchoring the midfield for Hotspurs, while Rovers lined up in a --, spearheaded by Steven Tulloch and Zack Singh.The opening stages were cagey, as the two teams felt each out. The big talking point of the opening half hour was an agricultural challenge by Scott Drever in the Rovers midfield. He went over the top of the ball on Jordan Low in the middle of the park, an offence referee Mike Cursiter saw fit to issue a caution to the midfielder, with Hotspurs looking for a red.Aiden Drever saw a free-kick go narrowly wide of Davy Leonard#s post after  minutes, while Tulloch might have done better with a half chance just before the half-time whistle. A driven ball from Graeme Horne on the left was nodded on by Singh, but the veteran Rovers striker couldn#t direct his header on target, with Hotspurs appealing for an offside flag.The match remained goalless at the break, with neither team having really got going.The match was soon to kick into le in the second half. After  minutes, Rovers ‘keeper Liam Valentine made a hash of a clearance, booting the ball against Spurs striker Jerry McBeth. With the goal gaping, the Hotspurs striker was just about to pull the trigger when he was tripped by Valentine.Cursiter awarded the free-kick, and after a long consultation with his linesman, deemed the challenge worthy of a yellow card only, despite the protestations of the away side. Joe Wilson#s effort from the set piece was tipped wide by the ‘keeper.Just before the hour mark, Rovers saw their best chance come and go. A long ball found Connan Rendall on the right, who controlled it wonderfully before shuffling inside to the edge of the box. His drilled effort looked every inch a goal until Leonard flung himself down to his left to tip it round the post.Moments later, the breakthrough was to come at the other end, as the match swung from end-to-end.Aiden Drever was penalised for a foul on Logan Peace wide on Hotspurs left. The free-kick was flighted in but cleared out to Joe Wilson. His cross back in found Hotspurs legend Wayne Monkman at the back post, whose header floated over the stranded Valentine for the opening goal. Could Monkman#s goal be the fairytale ending for the defender on his final Hotspurs appearance Rovers now needed to score twice in the last  minutes to win the title, but in truth they found a well-marshalled away defence dficult to break down. Hotspurs had the bit between their teeth, with a first ‘A’ League title since  now tantalisingly close.The hosts# task was made even more challenging when Aiden Drever was sent off for two bookings in quick succession with  minutes to go. From there, Hotspurs saw out the game relatively comfortably.In the th minute, Valentine got caught underneath a high ball into the box, dropping it at the feet of substitute Jack Paterson. As the sub tried to get a shot away, he was impeded by the Rovers goalie, who saw his second yellow card of the evening to ensure his side would finish with nine men.Seventeen-year-old midfielder Jessiman stepped up to coolly slot away the resultant penalty, ensuring Hotspurs would win the  ‘A’ League, and sparking scenes of delight amongst their support on the sidelines.OAFA president Colin MacLeod paid tribute to both sides for a hard-fought league campaign after the match, and invited up Hotspurs skipper Keith Harcus to receive the Brough Cup for his side.Harcus — standing in for the injured Owen Rendall — paid tribute to his centre-back partner Monkman who is set to bow out of domestic football as an ‘A’ League champion and urged his teammates not to go another  years before landing the biggest prize in domestic football.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There was a time when most of us had no doubt at all about what we should or should not do. We were told what was done or not done. There were Commandments. There were oaths administered by the scouting and guiding movements. There were role models to look up to. There was the expectation that politicians who lied were expected to fall upon their swords, or at least resign. Today, serial mendacity in a politician seems to be disregarded – indeed it might even propel one into high office. Remember Mr Profumo, who after uttering one untruth went off in voluntary exile to do good works in the East End of London for decades before he was welcomed back into respectable society. His exclusion today would be for an afternoon – at the most. O tempora, o mores is the muttered refrain of those who observe how things have changed.And yet, in spite of this seismic sht in the landscape of public le, there are still subtle moral issues that confront us in the leading of our day-to-day lives. One of these is the question of how far we should restrain ourselves in our curiosity as to how our friends and neighbours conduct their lives. How others live is, after all, a subject of abiding interest to most of us, and yet at the same time we are usually aware of at least some restraints on how much we should try to find out about others.: Alexander McCall Smith: Forget Brexit, we should argue about this insteadFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereTake the case of conversations in a restaurant or coffee bar. Should you listen to what is being said at neighbouring tables, or should you deliberately close your ears to conversations to which you have not been formally admitted  These conversations are often fascinating, andyou are by yourself at a table, then the temptation to listen is in almost irresistible. And yet that is an act of intrusion – a form of eavesdropping, which is generally regarded as unacceptable. If one would not listen at a keyhole, then surely the same must be said for other situations where one attempts to hear what is being said.The dference, of course, might lie in implicit consent. If you conduct a conversation in a public place, then you might be said to consent to others hearing what you have to say. Indeed, an argument might be made to the effect that it is wrong to conduct any form of sensitive conversation in public as you have no means of knowing whether those about you actually want to hear what you have to say.A iation on this is the mobile phone conversation. The frustrating thing about such conversations is that we overhear only one side, and again it is not the eavesdropper who is being rude – it is the person on the phone who is showing discourtesy. The polite thing – indeed the right thing – to doyou are having a telephone conversation in public, is to switch to speakerphone mode so that those about you can hear what the other person is saying. Quiet coaches are all very well, but there is a strong case for noisy coaches too, in which those using their mobiles would be obliged to plug them into a public address system so that everyone in the coach can hear both sides of the conversation. That, in my view, is common courtesy.Now for a tricky one. In Edinburgh, where we have a very advanced recycling culture, every householder is given a blue plastic box into which empty bottles and jars can be put out for collection. These come with a frilly plastic cover that can be stretched out over the top of the box, thereby making it impossible for prying eyes to see what is inside. In reality, most people lose these quickly and therefore put out their boxes without any cover. That means thatyou walk along the street you can see exactly what your neighbours have been drinking. This is very interesting information – irresistible to most . But it really is very interesting to count the number of whisky bottles or check up on the vintage of the recycled bottles. And champagne ... who would imagine that so much champagne is consumed in the EH postal code  However, most of the empty bottles I have seen have been very cheap brands.As to other bins left out by neighbours, some people like to look into the food recycling bins that the council provides. Again, that is not something that should be countenanced. Food waste is private, and it is no business of ours what other people consume, fascinating though it may be. Of course that recycling effort is particularly laudable, and those councils – such as Edinburgh – that provide that facility deserve the highest praise. Many people do not know, of course, that the waste in those little grey bins is taken off to a secret council location and processed into food for students. Students don’t know that, I believe, but I am sure that they would be unlikely to object. After all, those who were students some time ago remember the rubbish we ate and it is hard to imagine that this reprocessed food waste is any worse. In fact, it might be healthier. Looking into the recycling bins of neighbours is undoubtedly an unacceptable intrusion, on a par, perhaps, with the reading of people’s postcards. Hold on, you say – a postcard is specically designed not to be confidential: it is an inherently open communication. I am not convinced of that. Admire the picture, yes, but do not read what is written on the other side, or,you must, give it only the quickest of glances.The moral le is not simple. However, nobody can go wrongthey accept the principle of Kant’s Categorical Imperative. That is an idea that has been recycled many times, but remains as powerful today as it was when Kant first recycled it. More of that another time – or times perhaps. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit jacob rees mogg slammed for slouching during key debate","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Leader of the House was seen reclining in the chamber, at times with his eyes closed, as MPs discussed plans to take control of the Commons agenda and pass legislation which would prevent a no-deal Brexit on October .Green Party MP Caroline Lucas told Mr Rees-Mogg his body language was \"so contemptuous of this House and of the people\".: Boris Johnson to seek snap election after Commons Brexit defeatAddressing him in the Commons, Ms Lucas added: \"For the benefit of Hansard, the Leader of the House has been spread across around three seats, lying out asthat was something very boring for him to listen to tonight.\": Nicola Sturgeon to seek lsquotransfer of powerrsquo for indyrefMr Rees-Mogg appeared to furrow his brow in disagreement in response.As he laid back, Mr Rees-Mogg could be seen pressing his head against a speaker, a tactic often used by MPs attempting to more clearly hear debates in the chamber.His apparent repose prompted heavy criticism on Twitter from political opponents.Shadow transport minister and Labour MP, Karl Turner, tweeted: \"As a working class bloke brought up on a council estate in Hull I always feel enormous pride and gratitude when I go into the chamber of the House of Commons to represent east Hull.\"Ive never felt a sense of entitlement.

The legislation is currently being scrutinised by MSPs.“We intend to offer the people of Scotland a choice of a better and more positive future as an independent nation,” she said in Parliament today.The SNP leader was setting out her Programme for Government at Holyroodas MSPs ed from their Summer break.Westminster has control over the constitution and it would require a transfer of power - through a Section  order - to allow a second referendum to be held.

The First Minister has previously said she could hold a referendum late next year.Ms Sturgeon warnedthat the issue will be at the heart of the looming general election, expected to be held next month.“Let me be crystal clear today, the SNP will put Scotland’s opposition to Brexit and our right to choose independence at the very heart of that contest.”The move by cross-party opposition and Tory rebels to block a No Deal Brexit in the Commons was also backed by the SNP leader..“Given the anti-democratic move last week by Boris Johnson to shut down Parliament, it is absolutely vital that this effort succeeds,” Ms Sturgeon said.“SNPMPs will do everything possible to stop the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal. Scotland did not vote for any form of Brexit and having a catastrophic No Deal imposed upon us is completely and utterly unacceptable.”But Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, slammed the prospect of another referendum“This is an irresponsible and reckless threat from Nicola Sturgeon,” she said.“The very last thing that Scotland needs at a time of constitutional crisis is more constitutional chaos.“This is a stark reminder that the SNP never seeks to bring people together only to ide people and make communities poorer.“The First Minister should drop the threat of a isive independence referendum and honour her promise that the  referendum was a ‘once-in-a-generation’ contest.“We are stronger together as part of the UK, pooling and sharing resources to grow our economy and protect public services, and keeping the pound.”For all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll scottish tories facing wipe out at general election","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The problems of the Scottish Conservatives continued today as new polling analysis showed that the party would lose all but three of their  seats at the next general election.The new poll for The Times, carried out by Yougov, shows that the Scottish Conservatives, still reeling from the shock resignation of party leader Ruth Davidson last week, would almost be wiped out north of the border despite making sweeping gains at the election of .

A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.To be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats.

Matt Aumlkerfeldt worked as Nikolaj Coster-Waldau’sstand in and body double from  to the show’s grand end this year. Caution - Contains spoilersyou haven’t watched the final season yet!Matt applied to be an extra on the show when it first came to Northern Ireland then ended up landing a full on role.“I did a few days of extra work and then got noticed by the casting staff as I bore a resemblance to Nikolaj, who played Jamie Lannister.“Most of my measurements were the same as him, down to even my hand size which was vital from season three as Jamie has his hand cut off. “I worked about  days a year on the show and then during season eight I was there pretty much every day!”In ‘real le’, Matt, who is , loves working in the Fairhill branch of Cafe Nero’s.  Born in Sweden, Matt moved to Northern Ireland when he was a child with his mum. He has adopted the Ballymena area as his home and says Game of Thrones helped keep him here. He explained: “I would get in before all the other cast and crew and have a rough idea of what scenes were going to be shot that day. I’d then go over them with the director and the camera guys plus the director of photography.“I’d be given some direction and then take part in crew rehearsals. After this would be the full rehearsal with all the extras, so by the time the main cast come on set I’ve probably gone through the scene about  times!“Nikolaj would then come on and get some short notes from the director before I’d also give him notes as I’ve already ran the scene. My face is never actually recorded on camera but I’ve been in every one of his scenes. “Working then as a body double was dferent. When doing this I dressed up in the character of Jamie and picked up the shots.“This even applied to the nude scenes, which I was comfortable with as I’m not really a shy person and don’t get nervous easily!”Although it would be practically impossible to tell the dference between Matt and Nikolaj on screen, Matt said: “I know all the scenes I did and,anything, it’s a bit illusion breaking as I also know what’s behind the scene!”So what was Matt’s favourite moment from the whole Game of Thrones season  His answer was the iconic trial of Jamie Lannister in Season .“All the main cast were together,” Matt explained.“On that day Nikolaj got wrapped early so when he’s not on screen all the actors are actually looking at me and I was delivering his lines to them. “I had this amazing line up of actors looking at me. It was a big moment in the whole series and I suppose I was relatively nervous!“When action is called, it’s like your le stops, you’re no longer in this world you feel you’re actually in Westeros. Then when cut is called everyone is back to normal. It’s amazingnot a little weird!”Being a body double meant that Matt wore the original costumes.“I wore Nikolaj’s costume alot, including the armour which is real.“I had to keep my body a certain shape so as to fit it plus I did have to keep pretty fit to carry it.“When we started working with the gold hand, my own arm was strapped behind my back, which was pretty uncomfortable, but the fake arm was amazing. It looked very real, down to the pours and hair on the skin.”It’s no secret that the last season of Game of Thrones was surrounded in secrecy! So how did Matt handle keeping the secret that almost  million people wanted to know He revealed: “I certainly didn’t tell too many people!“For nine years I kept all the secrets of the show and, especially in the last season it really was such a burden as there were so many consperies. It became hard to not talk about it and I really just wanted to tell someone about it.”Many of the ludicrous rumours about how the show would end were indeed , however Matt did confirm that scripts were destroyed after each scene was filmed.He said: “There were hundreds of people in the crew during the last season so it got to the point that sets were closed.“There was also misinformation circulated. One part of the crew would be told a certain detail about a scene or filming while another would be told something , all just to throw people off the scent of what was really going on.  “On one occasion Nikolaj went to Seville just so as people would think he was filming there when infact he wasn’t.”Final EpisodeThe final episode and season was met with much acclaim but it wasn’t without some negative reviews. Many people thought the ending wasn’t as dramatic as should have been, and some were left disappointed.To a certain extent, Matt agrees.“I think there was alot of character progression over the years that was forgotten about or pushed aside during the final season, and perhaps some characters could have had a more gloried end. “Perhaps the writers were concentrating on dferent projects. “My view was that this was the last season, we should have gone all out!”On Jamie’s last scene, where he died under a pile of rubble in the arms of his sister, Matt has his own philosophy.“In my head I’d like to think that Jamie was actually going to kill Cersei so as he could have a proper future with Brienne of Tarth.”Matt talks fondly of all the cast members, especially Nikolaj.He said: “I love Nikolaj. I obviously spent alot of time with him and I went to the wrap party which was great too.Gwendoline Christie, who played Brienne of Tarth was a lovely lady and I was friends with Jacob Anderson who played Greyworm. I got to know everyone well and generally everyone was really nice.” Le after Game of ThronesThe future is certainly bright for Matt as he aspires to get more recognised as an actor.“Currently I’m working at the Game of Thrones exhibition in Belfast and doing some photography work.“I’ve started a series of YouTube videos going round the Thrones locations in Northern Ireland and explaining them.“I recently did a video from Cushendun caves, which is special to me as it’s actually where Nikolaj and I had our last scene together.“From that I was noticed by a writer, currently writing a movie and was sent the script. So I potentially have the opportunity to be part of the main cast for that upcoming movie. “I don’t have an agent as I need a showreel of me infront of the camera, sothis movie works out I’ll get the showreel then hopefully an agent and we’ll see where it goes from there.“I also really want to keep my job in Nero’s as I love it there!”Looking back, Matt had such a great experience working on Thrones.“It was a great nine years! But when it all aired and all the secrets were out I felt really free. It was like a car had been lted off my shoulders as there was so much information I had to keep to myself!”Matt still hasn’t watched the final season on TV.“I still miss it as it was better than anything I’ve worked on before but I’ll watch it at some point, I know what happens at the end of the day!” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2228521.jpg--.jpg?1567156924000\n","title":"j p corry site re opens","story":"Local builders’ merchants, JP Corry, officially reopened its’ Ballymenabranch on Monday th August following a devastating fire that closed the site just  weeks ago.

I’ve been at this business  years and I am well used to the rough and tumble of it, but I simply can’t allow this to go uncontested. It was entirely antagonistic the whole way through. I have been through the mill many times but I know when I have been treated unfairly.”He continued: “They brought me on to deliberately denigrate everything that I stand for.

Mr Pence was speaking just moments after the Taoiseach had asked him to bring an understanding of the Good Friday Agreement and the backstop back to Washington. Theof a hard border on this island was described as a \"very real risk\" by Mr Varadkar. He said Brexit could create barriers to north-south co-operation and risk peace. \"We as a government have to stand our ground on the Agreement. All I ask is that you bring that message back to Washington with you. This is not a problem of our making. It is one we want to solve through an orderly Brexit and a withdrawal agreement that guarantees no re-emergence of a hard border on this island,\" Mr Varadkar explained.Sources said the Taoiseach repeatedly explained the Republics attachment to the backstop during a private -minute meeting with Mr Pence. One official said Mr Pence appeared to have a \"good understanding\" of the issues and the Irish Governments \"commitment to the Good Friday Agreement\". But separate sources admitted the comments by Mr Pence were not what they would have hoped for under the circumstances. Mr Pence did acknowledge the \"unique challenges on your northern border\", saying he would encourage the UK and Ireland to ensure that any Brexit deal respects the Agreement.However, he quickly moved on to promise that the US would strike a trade deal with the UK once it is outside the EU. This is a controversial topic in the US, where a number of high-profile Irish American politicians are threatening to block a dealBrexit causes any damage to the Good Friday Agreement. Among those who have publicly committed to stalling a trade deal is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Civic and business groups last night called on Mrs Pelosi to only back a UK trade deal that protects the Good Friday Agreement.The letter is signed by more than  civil liberty groups, community organisations, trade unionists and representatives of businesses across Northern Ireland. A delegation from the consortium will travel to Washington later this month to outline their concerns to speaker Pelosi and other senior US politicians from the main parties in Congress.In the letter, the groups asked speaker Pelosi to ensure the US Congress scrutinised any future trade deal with the UK \"very carefully to ensure full compliance with the  Agreement\".\"We urge Congress to satisfy itself that the truly transformational foundations for peace and prosperity here, which were laid with the indispensable aid of the United States, are not undermined in any manner by decisions to be taken in Congress,\" the letter said.The groups that have signed the letter include the Committee on the Administration of Justice, the Freight Transport Association , the Human Rights Consortium, Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, Manufacturing NI, Disability Action Northern Ireland, Irish Congress of Trade Unions, NICVA, Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI and Unison Northern Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"bear cub stuck in rubbish dumpster saved with a ladder","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Amongst the pupils at the house which was called Tanus, was a young Samuel Beckett who attended there between the age of five and nine.The school was located on the Leopardstown Road between Foxrock and Stillorgan and in his later years literally giant still recalled that the place had a big lawn where, between classes, he and his brother Frank would play with the other children.Also, whilst they were attending the school, the Beckett’s father acted as a surveyor for a new building that the Elsner’s had constructed at the end of their garden to act as a gymnasium.Having obviously inherited her father’s undoubted musical talent, Alex attended the Royal College of Music in London where she honed her contralto voice and on herto Ireland in  and took part in concerts with many of Dublin’s musical societies and remained an extremely popular choice for private recitals in the fashionable houses of the capital.Later in the s Alexandrina Elsner was travelling north to sing in Belfast and the North West as well. Amongst her first memorable appearances in Derry was a performance as a soloist at a St Columb’s Choral Union concert in February  and at another concert in October  at the city’s new Opera House on Carlisle Road.The stature of the appearance of Miss Elsner at Derry’s Opera House, which had opened in , should not be underestimated since there were very few venues of this stature in Ireland at the time that attracted only the top acts of the time. In fact, the Derry newspapers - the Standard, Derry Journal and Londonderry Sentinel lauded her as one of the most favoured performers of the local audiences.Renowned Italian opera companies regularly visited Derry to perform and such was the popularity of the city’s Opera House that late night train services for audiences were often laid on from Inishowen and in the city late evening tram services allowed audiences to travel more easily to the shows.When she married Abraham Stewart on June ,  Alex Elsner moved to Derry where she wasted no time in throwing herself into the cultural le of a city esteemed for not only for its love of music but its wealth of talent as well.Just two years after her arrival in her new home, Alexandrina had established the Londonderry Philharmonic Society and Londonderry Feis. The Feis, beginning as a single day event on April ,  eventually bloomed into a week-long festival of music and singing by the s and she herself took lead roles in the bi-annual performances of the Philharmonic Society.The budding impresario wisely took counsel from the organisers of the Feis Ceoilin her native city of Dublin and invited a representative to Derry to advise on how to establish a local version. As a result, Derry became the second place in Ireland to establish such a festival, beating Sligoand Belfastto the punch.Initially, there were just a few competitions – for church choirs, factory choirs, school choirs, drum and flute bands, brass bands and for solo singers as well as special medals for songs sung in Gaelic awarded by the Derry branch of the Gaelic League. The interest of budding competitors was immediately taken as the workers of the famed city shirt factories quickly scrambled to form choirs specically for the Feis.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn advance of the first year of competition, by February of  three of the factories established four choirs. Welch Margetson  Co and Hogg  Mitchell both entered a choir each, whilst the much larger workforce at Tillie  Henderson entered two choral groups.With the passing decades the Feis gained more and more competitors and its repertoire of competitions expanded as a result not just from all over Ireland but from Scotland and England as well. As its prestige also increased, many of Derry’s businesses were glad to be associated with its success and donated beautul gold and silver cups and medals. Bursary schemes for those intent in pursuing a professional le in music and singing also began.In , just a year after partition, another woman Mrs Edward HenryO’Doherty founded Feis Doire Colmcille along with Fr Joseph McGettigan. The Derry Feis centred more upon Irish music, dancing and singing but despite the obvious cultural dferences, competitors from the Catholic and Protestant communities competed in both feiseanna without exception.Alexandrina Stewarts devotion to the Londonderry Philharmonic Society was equal to her commitment to the feis. Apart from featuring her own distinguished performances, the concerts also featured many distinguished musical names from both London and Dublin.In an era long before manufactured television vehicles, the twice-yearly Derry concerts also attracted talent scouts from far and near seeking bookings for their concert halls and opera houses.And, a major talent was spotted as the result of the Philharmonic Society’s concert in Derry on March , . James Johnston, a native of Belfast was well-known as an amateur singer in his younger days but was practically untrained at the highest level. Instead he concentrated as a career in butchery in his father’s shop and supplemented his income as a semi-professional singer at venues around Ireland.It was after his performance in Derry that he was snapped up by the Dublin Grand Opera Society and so began a huge career as an opera singer. It was after highly memorable performances in Rigoletto in Ireland’s capital in , the globally renowned theatrical director Tyrone Guthrie offered him a contract at Sadler’s Wells where he became principal tenor for well in excess of a decade.During his career Johnston played a wide range of roles which included his Covent Garden debut in La Traviata in  and also appeared with Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. Johnston retired at the height of his fame in  and simply ed to working in the family butcher’s business in Belfast’s Sandy Row where he lived out the remainder of his le until he died aged  in .Johnston’s success however was entirely based on being spotted in Derry and to the efforts of Alex Stewart’s in establishing the city’s Philharmonic Society. It too sprang from relatively humble beginnings, with having just over  in the chorus and nineteen strong orchestra in . By the s the society accounted for  voices and a  strong orchestra that drew its membership from all classes across Derry.The pinnacle of Alex’s own musical career had perhaps come in March  when she was soloist for the celebrated Halle Orchestra at St Columb’s Hall. The orchestra had been founded in  in Manchester by Sir Charles Halle to perform at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in January . The orchestra exists to this day and has been in residence at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester since .Abraham Stewart died suddenly in  and as a result, Alexandrina ed home to her family in Dublin, but ed to Derry every year without fail during feis week. The Feis Committee awarded her the honorary title of administrator and offered to pay the fare for herjourney for le.On May ,  Alex McCausland Elsner Stewart died at a nursing home in Dublin and her remains were brought to Derry and buried beside those of her husband in the city cemetery. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Her daughter, also called Alexandrina, had been killed just a few weeks previously whilst on active service in Burma during World War II.Abraham and Alexandrina had lived at the prestigious Crawford Square in Derry and it was there on April ,  that the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque marking her le and contribution to the cultural le of her adopted city.Commenting on the unveiling of the blue plaque, Chris Spurr from the Ulster History Circle said: “When Alexandrina Stewart embraced Ireland’s city of music, the result was a harmonious partnership founding the first Londonderry Philharmonic Society and the Derry Feis Ceoil.”CAPTION: The Londonderry Philharmonic Society on stage at the Guildhall."},{"url":null,"title":"derry needs gallery art lovers devastated loss ebrington gallery","story":"Art lovers in Derry have expressed their “disappointment” at the loss of an Ebrington gallery space which hosted the most prestigious modern art competition in the UK a matter of years ago.The Derry News exclusively revealed that Nerve Visual is set to close its doors at the end of this week.Artists based in the city say we should “demand” that this space is used to showcase the local arts scene and,properly promoted, it will prove to be a “massive draw” for both tourists and the local community.Since the announcement, people who are passionate about arts and culture have aired their views.National Museum NI curator, Kim Mawhinney, said: “I am devastated to hear this. We worked with Nerve Visual to bring two of our most impactful exhibitions from the Ulster Museum to Derry.”The exhibitions referred to are Silent Testimony and Art of the Troubles. “Derry needs this gallery!” she added.The Nerve Centre reopened the former Turner Prize gallery space as Nerve Visual in June  when it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.A spokesperson for the Nerve Centre said it has received no core funding and was programmed and funded on a project by project basis.In just over three years it has hosted  successful exhibitions.However, writer and art critic Dominic Kearney said he couldn’t understand why it was so poorly attended, particularly as the Turner Prize was such a success at the same location.Nerve Visual only took over a section of the Creative Hub Building   in  but during the City of Culture year in  the same gallery space hosted the prestigious Turner Prize - one of the best-known visual arts prizes in the world.Mr Kearney believes the location is “terric” and “exactly” what Ebrington needs. “The space is perfect for a gallery and the exhibitions that they had there were very impressive.“The Troubles Art exhibition, Future Artist Makers and the Colin Davidson one was stunning, I’d hesitate to say beautul given the nature of its subject, but it was incredibly powerful.“It’s the only gallery that’s open to the public in Derry that deals with mainstream, accessible, representational art. For this to close is really going to detract from the local art scene, from Ebrington, the Waterside and Derry as a whole. Like a pebble dropped in a pond, the ripple effect will spread out from that building to the outer ring of the entire city.”He added: “It’s such a shame, in six years it’s gone from hosting the most prestigious modern art competition in UK to a couple of empty rooms.“People can only have so many cups of coffee, tourists need something to do when visiting the city. If there was a gallery dedicated to Irish art with links to galleries in Dublin, the Ulster Museum, and maybe Britain. Tourists would definitely want to go there as galleries are the type of thing people look for.”‘Massive draw’Local artists were regularly showcased at the Nerve Visual gallery.Stephen Lewis has lived in Derry for over  years, he’s an artist based at Bishop Street Studios who also works with the arts charities Creative Village Arts and ArtLink at Fort Dunree. He expressed his “disappointment” at the gallery’s closure.“There have been recent initiatives by the Nerve Visual, Tower Museum and An Culturalann to give folk here a chance to see art that is held in their own national collections - but it simply goes back to the inability to keep a space that is equipped to do this open.“People in the North West should not have to travel to Belfast to see their own art - The Ulster Museum often has  or  art exhibitions on at any one time - we built a world class gallery in  and we really should demand that this becomes our space to see our own art collections - properly advertised it could be a massive draw for locals and tourists alike.\"It’s understood there will be plenty of people interested in taking over occupancy of the building but at this stage it is unclear what will be based there.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures 39 wall wall sunshine 39","story":"Berriew Show President and grandfather, Mark Bright, presents cup winner in the ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtover s fancy dress ltspan classtruncate-full-screengtto Olivia Jonesfrom Berriew.

Work to widen Fountain Street to provide on-street parking and traffic calming measures has already been completed, while a pound, project at Collinsrsquo Corner is currently underway.Roads officials have previously suggested the introduction of a one-way system but little or nor progress appears to have been made on this particular scheme.While pleased with the work in Fountain Street and Collinsrsquo Corner, Cllr Curran believes they will not have a positive impact on town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with senior roads engineers. He is also concerned that no progress is being made to tackle a congestion and road safety issue at Edward Street in the town.His call for talks to discuss solutions to town centre congestion came ahead of a special meeting between councillors and roads officials last night when the Department of Infrastructure presented its annual report which details work that has already been completed on ious schemes and what projects are in the pipeline.Cllr Curran said the annual report contained no ldquoconcrete proposals for addressing town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with engineers.ldquoA proposed road between Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue has been shelved due to the cost involved and the minimal impact it would have on tackling congestion, he said. ldquoThat is why we need to get round the table and look at all options moving forward.ldquoCan lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking ldquoAll the key players need to get together as years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors.Cllr Curran says the time has come to ldquograsp the congestion nettle with the onus on roads officials to finally deliver by taking a critical look at the problems.ldquoWe need to take a critical look at the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward. I suspect that the congestion issue that we have in Downpatrick would not be allowed to go unaddressed in any other major town in the country. We have had numerous reports on the way forward but what people, in particular those in the business community what to see, is action, he continued.ldquoDownpatrick councillors need to join forces and sit down with roads engineers to look at what can be done. Apart from the development of the Saul Way link road, there has been no major traffic development in Downpatrick town centre for decades.ldquoThe congestion problem is getting worse andthe ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station base and adjoining buildings are to be a success and attract new commercial and private development, we need to solve the traffic problem.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe congestion is driving shoppers out of the town and we need to arrest this decline. To achieve this, I believe that we need a brainstorming sessions to come up with a new blueprint on the way forward. There must be an end to a congestion problem blighting the local economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/28th August 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C August 28%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A young Ballynahinch familyrsquos seven-month ordeal ended yesterday mdash only hours after the Down Recorder took up their case.Thatrsquos how long the McGrory family have been waiting for a new fireplace in the living room of their Housing Executive house at Windmill Gardens.After such a long wait, workmen finally arrived out yesterday afternoon, less than  hours after the Recorder had contacted Housing Executive headquarters about the situation.The problems for the family started three years ago when their fireplace broke up. Housing Executive workmen carried out repairs, but seven months ago the fireplace again broke up. Since then repeated calls to the Executive met with little or no response.ldquoWith winter fast coming we needed this fireplace fixed, said Mr Terry McGrory. ldquoDuring the summer months we managed to make do, but therersquos no way we could face cold nights without a fire in our living room.ldquoSince February wersquove had to do without a fire and it was beginning to look like it wouldnrsquot be fixed at all. Wersquove called on the Housing Executive numerous times and used up all the repair forms at the back of our rent book, but still no-one had it fixed.Mrs Mildred Terry was equally unhappy. ldquoThe last time they came to fix the fireplace three years ago, they simply pushed it back against the wall and plastered it over the wallpaper which we had just put on, she said.ldquoIt became a big nuisance having to hope that friendly neighbours would help us wash our clothes and provide us with baths, because we were unable to heat our water by the use of the fire.BISHOPSCOURT mdash Police are investigating the circumstances leading to the death of an RAF sergeant at Bishopscourt last Tuesday evening. The sergeant was seen running into bushes at the camp and two shots were heard. He was found later with two gunshot wounds to the head.

Mrs Josephine King, on behalf of the people, presented Dr Moore with an inscribed watch and a cheque and Mrs Moore with an inscribed watch, while Miss Una Hardy presented Mrs Moore with a bouquet of flowers.Dr Moore thanked everyone for their generosity and stressed how much he had enjoyed practising in the Castlewellan area for so many years.SAINTFIELD mdash Residents beside a quarry near Saintfield who frequently had windows broken in their homes when blasting took place had their grievances aired at a recent meeting of Castlereagh Borough Council.A local councillor, Mr J A Lowe, raised complaints of householders whose windows are shattered by blasting at Lisdoonan Quarry.Mr Lowe said residents had suffered from broken windows and undue noise on many occasions. He wanted to knowplanning permission covered the size of explosives used in the quarry.He was told that  conditions were attached to the planning permission, covering such issues as the size of explosive charges and the permitted distance from the nearest dwellings.KILLYLEAGH mdash Work on a major housing redevelopment programme in Killyleagh is in danger of grinding to a halt. Speculation is mounting that the main contractors are getting ready to pull out because of unpaid bills by the Housing Executive.Ten houses which have been virtually complete for six months are still lying idle because minor sub-contract work has not been started. Ten families, who were told last December that new homes would be ready by February, are still waiting and the situation is fast becoming a deadlock.The poundm redevelopment scheme at Irish Street was to have been a Housing Executive showpiece. Work began on building  new homes in two phases in . The scheme had been designed to ldquoretain the character and charm of Killyleagh, transforming the old houses into modern housing for some  people.The Housing Executive have flatly refused to comment on the latest developments at the site and they will not go into the many complaints, except to admit that there are problems at the site.Three weeks ago a major row erupted all over the province when a dispute in the Executiversquos finance department caused a backlog of payments to dozens of small construction firms.DOWNPATRICK mdash A group of residents in the Flying Horse housing estate in Downpatrick are campaigning for proper dustbins to be provided.At present residents are supplied with paper bags which they say are too small and do not hold any great weight of refuse. They cannot be use for ashes, which residents must pile up in their back gardens.Their campaign has been taken up by Mr Raymond Blaney, of Republican Clubs the Workersrsquo Party. ldquoWhen it rains heavily the bags fall apart and the rubbish is scattered all over the place. Often dogs tear the bags apart with the same results, he said.ldquoThe Flying Horse residents are at a loss to know why Model Farm, a much more recent estate, is supplied with proper metal dustbins while they must do with a totally inadequate paper bag system.STRANGFORD mdash The first ever Strangford Festival went down a smash hit success and the town vibrated with fun and laughter over four days.The festival kicked off on Friday evening with a band parade and carried over the whole bank holiday weekend, culminating with a dance on Monday.

I hope that by implementing this action plan we can make a real dference to the residents of our district.Last year, there was across-the-board political support for a motion calling for a major housing conference to take place to address the social housing crisis.At the time, it was revealed that Newcastle was a social housing need hot spot with  people on the waiting list for new homes classed in the urgent need category.Politicians were told that a lack of available land to build new homes was exacerbating the crisis in a resort where rented properties were at a premium, with houses that do come on the market snapped up by people for use as holiday homes.Councillors say they are keen for all ious stakeholders collaborating to provide short, medium and long term solutions to tackle the crisis.In addition, they are keen to see a focus on building appropriate housing for the changing needs of the district, including the increasing demand for single occupancy dwellings and housing that meets the needs of vulnerable people.Politicians say more affordable housing is also required as house price growth is higher in Newry, Mourne and Down than the average growth experienced across Northern Ireland.They say there is a need to plan for long term needs, tackle homelessness and the poverty gap, social housing development and accessible homes provision.Politicians say they hope that by working with partners across the statutory, community, voluntary and private sectors, they can come up with solutions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/28th August 2019 Special.jpg","title":"Special film of Canon’s Excursion brings back memories  ","story":"THE screening of a special short film on the old Canonrsquos Excursion in Downpatrick took place at the townrsquos Ballymote Centre last weekend.Every summer, over  buses packed with local families would head off from the town for a day in Newcastle which to some excited children at the time seemed like a million miles away when in reality it was literally only up the road.New shoes and clothes were purchased ahead of the annual excursion so everyone was looking their best, with families gathering at the St Dillonrsquos Avenue sports pitches before marching to the townrsquos bus station via Edward Street, John Street, Irish Street and Market Street.A fun-filled day was spent in Newcastle, when the summers always felt warmer than they are today, with families ing home by bus, exhausted after a frantic but thoroughly enjoyable day.The last excursion is believed to have been held in the s, but local people last weekend had a unique opportunity to relive those halcyon days, thanks to a new initiative being spearheaded by the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association.It helped put together the short film which captures some of the the sights and sounds of the Canonrsquos Excursion which was one of the key events in Downpatrickrsquos social calendar.The film was screened last Friday night in front of a number of Stream Street residents and Housing Executive representatives when all those involved in the project were publicly thanked for their support.John Gordon, a member of the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which played a key role in getting the film project off the ground, was delighted to many people attended last weekendrsquos screening.ldquoIt was great to see some of the original Stream Street residents attend the screening which also provided people with an opportunity to reminisce about the old days, particularly the Canonrsquos Excursion which was a big event, he explained.John said the project to produce a film depicting the annual event was launched around two years ago and is pleased those who attended Friday nightrsquos event enjoyed themselves.ldquoA number of old photographs were also on display which brought back many memories for some, he

Model Farm and Flying Horse areas.A number of cars were again pelted with stones as they drove along the Killough Road, while several fires were also started on Saturday evening.On Sunday, part of the Brannish Road was reported to be barricaded with branches and supermarket trolleys with young people targeting passing cars with stones.The most disturbing incident occurred on Monday evening when a woman driving alone was left frightened after her car was stoned on the Brannish Road as she made her way to work.Police have confirmed that they are aware of the recent trouble and warned those responsible for the unruly behaviour that their involvement could lead to a criminal record and harm their future university and employment prospects.Officers have also appealed to anyone who can assist them with their enquiries to contact them as they work to apprehend those responsible for the trouble.The Flying Horse Ward Community Forum mdash which earlier this year organised a public protest to call for an end to trouble at this part of the town mdash has condemned the weekend incidents.The grouprsquos chairwoman, Lisa Perry, said the continuing trouble was ldquosimply not acceptable and must end. She also appealed to parents to know where their children are and what they are doing.Ms Perry said children need to be taught to respect the community where they live, the people of the Model Farm and Flying Horse areas and those who commute along the Killough Road.ldquoResidents and those who use the Killough Road should not have to put up with such behaviour and anyone who knows who is responsible should contact the police, she said.Ms Perry said the message must go out that stoning cars is not acceptable and that those responsible will not be be allowed to get away with what they are doing.ldquoIt does not bear thinking about what would happena driver whose car is stoned loses control of the vehicle and crashes into pedestrians or someonersquos home. Those who throw missiles at cars need to realise the potential consequences of what they are doing. For drivers, this is a terribly frightening experience.Angry residents have also taken to social media to voice their concern about the trouble which has been prevalent at this part of Downpatrick for many years.Parents have also been urged to warn their children not to get involved in behaviour which could lead to serious consequences, with residents branding those responsible for the trouble as ldquodisgraceful. They said their parents should be doing more to stop the unruly behaviour, expressing concern that the trouble has been allowed to continue for too long and must be stopped.ldquoThe trouble is too frequent, said one woman, while a man revealed his van was stoned on two occasions at the Killough Road last month. Worryingly, he reported that children as young as  were responsible.Another resident expressed concern that a driver could lose control of their car after being stoned which could result in a crash and someone being seriously injured.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said local police must respond swtly to the anti-social behaviour, especially after Monday nightrsquos incident when a woman was attacked.ldquoThere has been an escalation of the anti-social behaviour in the Flying Horse and Model Farm area from a number of youths. Cars have been stoned, fires started and people assaulted. This behaviour is unacceptable, he declared.ldquoThe perceived inactivity of the authorities cannot be allowed to send a message that such behaviour is acceptable. The perpetrators must be dealt with.Mr McGrath said police and other statutory agencies require information to challenge the anti-social behaviour and apprehend those responsible.He added: ldquoInformation can be provided confidentially and is needed to help break this cycle of behaviour at this part of Downpatrick.Police have asked anyone who believes they can assist them with their enquiries to make contact using the non-emergency  number or the confidential Crimestoppers number,  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10189049.jpg","title":"bomb explodes newtownbutler amid major security alert","story":"Police at the scene of an ongoing security operation in Newtownbutler have confirmed that some form of explosive device has detonated in the area.Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin said: ldquoAt around .am this morning Police officers at the scene have reported an explosion in the area of the Cavan Road at its junction with the Wattlebridge Road.

Picture by Jonathan Porter Press EyeHosts Morgan and Reid clashed with former DUP health minister Mr Wells, who said that Strictly is “family viewing”, adding: “You’ve had a busy week, you sit down with the family and you watch pure entertainment.“The last thing you want is to be challenged or to be asked deep intellectual questions.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog

.desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Mr Wells, who makes his opposition to same-sex marriage widely known, said that he believes same-sex couples should only be shown on Strictlyit were after the watershed of pm.He cited Blind Date, saying that the programme “went down the plughole” and that viewers switched off after the “radical” move to include homosexual and lesbian couples.Morgan and Reid asked what time he thinks gay couples should be allowed on TV, to which he replied: “Exactly the same time as the BBC thought two years ago, pm.”Morgan asked him: “What are you like at parties  Do you ever dance ”Mr Wells said he rarely dances in public, to which Morgan said: “When you danced and men came on the dancefloor, how did you feel  At what point did you feel like a man entering your orbit became a problem for you ”Reid also challenged Mr Wells’ views, asking: “Have you ever seen children dancing  They dance together, girls dance together, boys dance together, there’s nothing challenging about it.“Your concern is only about seeing gay couples - it’s not about children.”Morgan told him: “I think you’re just an old bigoted dinosaur, and you feel challenged because you don’t like the idea of scary gay people around you.”Referring to former Strictly professional Robin Windsor, who appeared on the programme and was sat next to him, the presenter added: “There’s one right next to you Jim, the whole time you’ve been talking you’ve been in close proximity to a gay man.”Only surviving signatory of

Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Windsor said that he thought Mr Wells’ belief that same-sex couples should only be seen dancing after the watershed was “an absolute disgrace”.During the debate, Mr Wells also said his views are not a “repressed” thing after Morgan told him: “Most people who have this weirdly anti-gay sentiment at some stage in their le have had a ‘feeling’.”After the politician claimed he was being insulted by Morgan, the broadcaster replied: “I’m not insulting you, I’m insulting your bigotry, which is irrational, inconsistent, makes no sense whatsoever, your favourite shows have loads of gay presenters on, there’s a gay judge on Strictly, you think that’s fine but you won’t have two people - who may not even be gay - dancing together.”Mr Wells, who lost the DUP whip after criticising the leadership last year, askedMorgan is meant to be impartial for the interview, to which Reid said: “How can you be impartial about homosexuality ”The politician claimed he has received a lot of support for speaking out about his views, but that people are “scared to stand by traditional values” in fear of the backlash.The BBC last week said that Strictly is an “inclusive show” and that they are “proud to have featured same-sex dancing amongst the professional dancers in group numbers in previous series”.A spokesman said: “We are completely open to the prospect of including same-sex pairings between our celebrities and professional dancers in the future, should the opportunity arise.”try catch  TrendingTransfer

That whip has now been withdrawn.“If tonight’s motion had been lost, a no-deal Brexit would have been almost inevitable. Probably not a good career move but the right choice.”A source close to the rebels said: “Tonight’s decisive result is the first step in a process to avert an undemocratic and damaging no-deal.“No  have responded by removing the whip from two former chancellors, a former lord chancellor and Winston Churchill’s grandson. What has happened to the Conservative Party ” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the Prime Minister: “He wants to table a motion for a general election, fine.“Get the Bill through first in order to take no deal off the table.”Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said it was vital that the Commons does not “tip our country into an election at a point where there is any risk that we will crash out of the European Union during that election campaign or immediately after”.“We must act responsibly,” she told MPs.Wednesday is set to be a dramatic day in the Commons, with Mr Johnson due to take his first Prime Minister’s Questions at noon before the Chancellor Sajid Javid sets out public spending plans.MPs will then debate the draft legislation put forward by a cross-party group which would require a delay to Brexit unless there was a deal or Parliament explicitly backed leaving the EU without one by October .A vote on a general election could be held later in the day.Meanwhile, a decision is expected at the Court of Session in Edinburgh after a cross-party group of MPs and peers brought legal action aimed at halting the suspension of Parliament.try catch  TrendingTransfer Deadline Day RECAP: Rangers confirm pound.m Ryan Kent signing

Of those,  have been empty for more than two years.Landlords will be given incentives to bring long term empty properties into use as the council says they attract crime and anti-social behaviour, drive down values and become ldquodetrimental to the lives of residents.Measures are set out in a draft strategy which the councilrsquos cabinet, on July , agreed to publish for public consultation.While the council wants landlords to accept help to get homes in use, the strategy says theauthority will take actionnecessary.Vale council deputy leader Cllr Lis Burnett told the meeting she was ldquostunned more than  homes in the Vale have been empty for more than two years.ldquoItrsquos absolutely staggering, she said. ldquoA strategy on a way we can tackle it is very welcome.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

powerlifting competition for toby  ","story":"A -year-old Tandragee man has received a surprise invitation to represent Northern Ireland in powerlting, only  months after taking up the sport as a result of a joke.Personal trainer Toby Clarke is heading to the Commonwealth Powerlting Championships in St Johns, New Foundland, Canada for September  - having reacted with scepticism to his initial invitation.Toby can now lt almost . times his body weight.“I received the news by email in July while I was finishing up my morning sht in work,” he said. “I initially thought that there had been a mistake and it was sent to me by accident but after a phone call and a couple of back and forward emails I found out that it was genuine and that there was no mistake.“I had only started training for and competing in powerlting back in January  and had competed in my third ever competition back at Christmas in .”He is now able to deadlt almost . times his own body weight, a very respectable achievement in the sport.He did have some experience previously in weightlting while a student at Loughborough University, a dferent sport which requires more speed and complex skills to lt usually lighter weights above the head.“While at Loughborough the weightlters and powerlters trained together and one of my friends, a powerlter, jokingly suggested that I switch to powerlting. So a few months later I did.”In powerlting the aim is to lt as much weight as possible in the deadlt, squat and bench press. The best of three efforts in each lt then gives a total, with the highest total in each weight class winning.His powerlting personal bests at around kg body weight are a kg squat, a kg bench press and kg deadlt, while his weight lting bests are kg in the snatch and a kg clean and jerk. Now head coach at Kaizen Strength gym, near Lurgan, the former Portadown College student earned a degree in Sports Science from the Belfast Met and Loughborough University and is studying for a masters degree in Strength and Conditioning at St Mary’s University in Twickenham. His own trainer is former Loughborough powerlting coach Alec Hewstone of Focus Strength and Conditioning gym in Portadown. He added: “Qualying for the Commonwealth Powerlting Championships was never on my mind and I believed that it would have been another couple of years before I felt that I would have been at the right level before I would have thought about trying to qualy for a competition of that calibre.” He adds: “Training for Canada has been hard going physically but more mentally challenging. I would love to improve all of my lts and my total. However, I’ve picked up a few niggles over the past few weeks, so I just want to go out, enjoy myself, do what I can and stay injury free.”The cost of competing in Canada is stretching, he says, and having already committed all his £ savings to cover his flights, insurance and hotel stay, he has set up a GoFundMe page for supporters to assist with food, transport and additional costs which has so far raised £ of his £, target- www.gofundme f road-to-the-powerlting-commonwealth-games-"},{"url":null,"title":"no records of consultation with gaa on pitch strategy  ","story":"No records of consultation with the GAA on pitch strategy have been held by Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council, it has been revealed.According to a Freedom of Information response, the council has admitted it has no records of any dates, times or minutes of any meetings with the GAA on pitch strategy.The Council had consulted widely on the Craigavon Pitch Strategy but Sinn Fein challenged the council on the level of consultation with the GAA.In June an Ulster GAA spokesperson said: “At no stage was Ulster GAA consulted in relation to the ABC Council pitches strategy.“Previous reporting on the matter indicated that Ulster GAA had been involved in the process, however, this was incorrect.” Having submitted Freedom of Information requests, ious GAA clubs across north Armagh received answers last Thursday from the council regarding the ‘consultation’.The letter revealed no records of any dates, times or minutes of meetings with the GAA in relation to Craigavon pitch strategy had been found.Sinn Féin Councillor Catherine Nelson said the freedom of information response from ABC council ‘is damning but not surprising’.She said: “I questioned the level of consultation that had taken place with GAA clubs upon seeing the council’s pitch strategy in draft form.“I was assured consultation had taken place however it soon became apparent that this was far from the case.“This Freedom of Information response is damningnot unsurprising and demonstrates a complete failure to consult.“This is not how council should do business.

All clubs in north Armagh also communicated likewise to confirm no consultation took place.“At a recent council meeting it was voted to go ahead despite clubs’ collective concerns, with the Recreational Department in attendance on the night.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/catherine_1.jpg","title":"word from the wise kathryn collie","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business How did you start out in your business  I followed the fairly well trodden path of completing my legal practice course at the University of Law in Guildford, having graduated with a degree in law from university in England. Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years.
