Here, he tells Sophie Goddard how he’s keeping not only his pub afloat, but is helping out the people – and animals – around him, too ...For thousands of small business owners, the global pandemic has flung their futures – and those of their staff – into uncertainty. That’s certainly true for Graham Blaikie, and his pub the Mercat Grill in Whitecraig, Scotland. “I’d been watching the news about Covid-19 since December and luckily we’d prepared,” he explains. “Even before we closed, we had contactless hand sanitisers and I was always wiping down handles and menus. I’d also removed items from tables, so there weren’t as many touch points.” But when Boris Johnson’s March announcement saw pubs and restaurants close to the public, the business that had taken Blaikie nine years to build was suddenly forced to adapt for survival.The first step was ensuring customers could still enjoy the food they loved. “Prior to the shutdown, we’d been talking about what our strategy would be – I bought containers and had our takeaway menu prepped, so we were ahead of the game”, he says of being ready for business the next day. “We had a lot of fresh food in the pub, so on the Saturday we started the takeaway system.” But it wasn’t without its problems. “It’s not as easy as you think doing takeaway food, especially restaurant-style. When people order with us they’re having haggis cigars, patties, fish and chips, pepper beef with rice and my mum’s desserts ... that’s six different containers at least. We spent about £2,000 on takeaway boxes initially, that’s a lot of money. But it’s hopefully keeping us going.”With the government support package now in place – and extended until October – Blaikie has turned his attention to helping local people. Launching his Soup(er) Hero campaign in April, he is now making soup and sandwiches for those in need. With help from the community council, a community hub – where food is dropped off and distributed by local volunteers – was born. The feedback keeps him going. “There’s an older couple and the wife’s got cancer and every day they get their soup and sandwich,” he says. “They have the soup at 12 o’clock, then the man drives his wife to the hospital for her treatment and when they come back, they enjoy the sandwich. That’s what makes it worthwhile.”It’s not just people benefiting, either – residents of Edinburgh zoo are also tucking into the pub’s surplus wares. “I had a massive box of bananas left over and my mum said: ‘You should take this to the zoo.’ So I got hold of all my leftover fruit and knocked on the zoo door – and that’s been it ever since.” Now Blaikie’s weekly deliveries of fruit, vegetables and fish help to feed the animals at a time when visitors – the zoo’s main form of income – have come to a standstill. “You’d probably choose not to eat some of the bananas, for example, because they don’t look as good, but they’re perfectly fine for the animals. When we’re making sandwiches, not everybody likes the heels of the bread either, so I freeze them and take them along – nothing’s getting wasted. And if I see something for a good price at the wholesalers – apples, cabbages, broccoli - I’ll pick that up, too. We need to keep zoos going, they’re all under a lot of pressure.”While it’s difficult to ascertain when exactly businesses such as Blaikie’s will open again, for now, he is focusing on adapting the way they work to ensure business is possible. “We have an isolated table in the front vestibule area, so people can come in and collect food safely, using contactless on the card machines for takeaways. We have separate areas for drivers to sit in too, so we’re doing everything we can.” And plans are already afoot for when pubs are finally allowed to reopen. “I’m looking at adding an area to the outside, so people can sit there the whole year round and I’m hoping to put in a little microbrewerydistillery, so I could eventually make hand sanitiser further down the line.”Why focus on helping others when keeping his own business afloat requires such effort? “I believe in helping people. I know this virus is a horrible thing, but it’s bringing out a lot of good in people as well. Neighbours are looking after neighbours, people are helping others with shopping or taking dogs for a walk. For so long, I didn’t like the way the world was going ...”What does Blaikie hope will come out of this situation? He pauses, then says: “That people start to work together a bit more, being more thoughtful of what’s going on around them. And of course, that they come to the Mercat for a meal.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Nobody trusts nobody no more,” says a long-haired young man, building a wall (or perhaps a tomb). “Everybody’s like, ‘Don’t come near me bro, you might have the infection.’” But this isn’t lockdown Britain – nor indeed lockdown anywhere in 2020. It’s the Derbyshire village of Eyam during the 1665-6 plague outbreak, as imagined by artist Nick Burton in the exquisitely doomy new comic strip Our Plague Year.Burton has a flair for the bittersweet. The two-page comic Lily that he showed in the Manchester Open Exhibition at Home last year was a romance between a bicycle and the woman who first rode it. Recalling Lily, Bren O’Callaghan, the curator of Home, contacted Burton in March asking if he might consider producing a comic “addressing some of the themes that were prevalent in our society at the moment”.Home will release new episodes from Our Plague Year on its website every Friday from 29 May (the impatient can subscribe to an email that will reach them two days earlier.) “Each is a vignette that dips into a small moment,” says Burton, who has built up enough plot and material for Our Plague Year to stretch to 100 episodes. A book seems likely. God help us all if the serialisation is extended and we reach that many episodes while still under lockdown.Researching similar events throughout history, Burton came across the story of Eyam, a village in the Peak District that famously isolated itself from surrounding communities after the Black Death arrived in a cloth delivery from London. “You could immediately see the connection with what was going on in our society,” says Burton, who notes the irony that, although he’s just constructed a dramatic universe around Eyam, circumstances dictate that he’s never set foot in the actual village.It’s no bad thing that the setting of Our Plague Year exists only in Burton’s imagination as “an alternative-world Eyam”. It frees him to redraw phenomena of our present time as historical fiction: a population struggling with confusing guidelines from on high nosy neighbours avidly policing local behaviour kamikaze amblers using bodily proximity as a threat.Drawn as lockdown continues and moods shift, Our Plague Year can marry the long narrative arcs of a graphic novel with the responsiveness of a strip cartoon like Peanuts or Doonesbury, which are more “read one day and in the bin the next”, notes Burton.The parallels with plague-beset Eyam are darkly, comically real. “Just like today, we’d have some people who adhere to the lockdown and others that think it’s ridiculous,” says Burton. He describes how the wealthier residents of Eyam swiftly departed for other residences, and how the boundaries of the village were policed.Contemporary conspiracy theorists may be wigging out over 5G towers and secret labs in Wuhan the residents of Eyam looked to the superstitions of their own time for the source of their suffering. “It was the end of the age of magic and the beginning of the age of science,” says Burton. “So you still had people blaming the fairies for it: they were such capricious, evil creatures in those days, people were scared of them.”The most touching evocation of Eyam has happened on Burton’s own doorstep. William Mompesson, the vicar of Eyam, closed the church and instead led his congregation to worship in the open, by a rock called Cucklet Delf. With the synagogue shut in Burton’s Salford neighbourhood, the local rabbi has become equally inventive. “I live in a three-storey flat here, and my kitchen window looks into an open space bounded on all sides by townhouses and flats,” he says. This space, usually populated by kids and trampolines, has become an ad hoc synagogue, a Cucklet Delf for our times: “The rabbi in the middle, and everybody in their windows reading from the scriptures.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff40541a43327830287bc0ea34c1fd31f618c406/0_208_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a239bf37ef11f42c8c84e210af63f209","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"The new normal, the abnormal and the death of George Floyd – the most striking photographs from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbf58db455885e9e8ec493fcdf76ac22294521ee/0_0_6604_4403/master/6604.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5138e23caa2457ed779b83175b6490b9 720w","title":"the northern view leeds through the decades in pictures","story":"Photographer Peter Mitchell has been shooting Leeds for more than 40 years.

They took it very seriously. I think he would have locked us down for a bit longer”.“We tend to think that their medicine and their comprehension\u0026nbspof the science was all rubbish but actually they did know a lot,” she told Peter Florence, director of the festival. “They didn’t understand what is conceived through a microscope, they didn’t know of viruses\u0026nbspor bacteria, they didn’t know the causes of disease. But they did know how disease worked and how infections spread among the poor, that one should be clean and avoid dirt at all costs. They knew that cities were a locus of infection and they knew to ban crowds – so no public ceremonies when the plague was suspected … So in many ways, what the Tudors did in these times, was very much like what we have been enjoined to do. They just had different names for things.”In Wolf Hall, Mantel describes Cromwell, who would later become Henry VIII’s chief minister, isolating in his room as the disease passes through London: “The warm weather has brought sweating sickness to London, and the city is emptying … This plague came to us in the year 1485, with the armies that brought us the first Henry Tudor. Now every few years it fills the graveyards. It kills in a day. Merry at breakfast, they say: dead by noon.” Cromwell’s wife, Elizabeth, was suspected to have been killed by the sweating sickness in 1529. His daughters Anna and Grace died not long after, with his son Gregory following in 1551 during the last major outbreak in England.On Saturday, Mantel said she was finding the current circumstances interesting to observe. “It is hard to see any upsides to this but maybe it expands our imaginations a little, because many of us have lived such safe lives that we cease to understand how the natural world can undo us,” she said.“That’s not true of course if you live in an area where you are exposed to flooding or the results of meteorological disasters and it is not true for anyone who lives outside the little civilised oasis in western Europe and the United States. But many of us have lived safe lives and their lives in the past were so unstable, unsure and perilous compared to ours. So I think the present crisis gives us a little bit of fellow feeling with those suffering.”She also shed some light on the process of adapting the final book in her Cromwell trilogy, The Mirror and the Light, which was a bestseller when it was published in March, just before bookshops across the world closed due to the coronavirus. Mantel said she was working on the stage play with the actor Ben Miles, who portrayed Cromwell in the two previous plays, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, and also performed the audiobook versions.The BBC is also adapting the novel for a television series, with Academy Award winner Mark Rylance likely to reprise his role as Cromwell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60206cf0b880fb98a569613217f526a7b438f964/0_248_7360_4415/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3769e3b4f339e78d804e87d4a40d72ee","title":"stuart evers we either look into the gutter or at the upper classes","story":"The award-winning novelist on his debt to ‘kitchen-sink’ dramas, why the family is everyone’s first taste of politics, and the paranoia of the nuclear ageStuart Evers’s acclaimed debut collection Ten Stories About Smoking won the London book award in 2011. His new novel The Blind Light is an ambitious fictional account of 60 years in the intertwined lives of two soldiers from very different backgrounds, who meet during national service in 1959 and raise families in the shadow of the nuclear threat.You made your name as a writer of sharp, spare short stories your novel is 536 pages long. When did you start working on it?I can tell you exactly. Six years, 11 months and five days ago. The idea came when I went to visit a place called Hack Green Secret Nuclear Bunker with my mum and dad and my wife. It is what was known as a regional seat of government in the event of a nuclear bomb dropping, the local dignitaries would be rushed to it. It’s now a visitor centre.It’s not far from where you grew up, in Cheshire?Yes, just around the corner. And my mum and I had a shared terror of nuclear war. We walked around this place in utter silence. A couple in their early 20s were down there too, though, and they were looking at it all as if it was ancient history. Laughing at some of the exhibits. And I came out and thought I had to write something about that, about how quickly we seem to have forgotten the fear of those cold war years.The book begins at an army installation called Doom Town. Is that made up?No. I was doing this research and an old Pathé newsreel popped up on my screen. I was knocked sideways by this report from a bombed-out town where soldiers were learning how they would cope in the aftermath of a nuclear war. There was one particular shot of a man in bandages being fed a cup of tea by another soldier. I looked at these two young men and thought: what would this kind of experience of the end of the world do to you? How would you react? It started from there.Drum and Carter, the two soldiers, are ided by class, but united by a certain paranoia their lives feel out of control in different ways.Yes, I think there was something personal in wanting to find a control of my own. I had become a father when I started the book and that maybe brings a more complicated set of fears. As I write in the book, the first political system we all encounter is the family – whether it is a benevolent oligarchy or an absolute dictatorship. Fatherhood makes you ask questions of the kind of person you want to be. I was interested in that difference between the upper-middle-class approach of Carter and the more prosaic working-class lifestyle that Drum enjoys.It feels a bit unusual, bizarrely, to read a serious English novel in which the male protagonist is not a publisher or a writer or something. You were conscious of that?Yes. When I was growing up I didn’t see people like myself in any of the fiction I was reading. Even Orwell and Joyce were public school boys. Then the school librarian gave me a copy of Room at the Top by John Braine, and I just hoovered up all those “kitchen sink” novels, The L-Shaped Room, Billy Liar, Saturday Night, Sunday Morning, just because I recognised the pubs and the people.It sometimes seems that fictional voice disappeared along with mass employment in the 1970s.My first job after university was as a bookseller. I lost count of, and patience with, the number of novels published in which everyone was extraordinary in some way in Ian McEwan’s books for example. Whereas the American idea – in Raymond Carver or Jayne Anne Phillips or Toni Morrison – seemed the opposite. You would have ordinary people placed in an extraordinary situation.Why do you think there was that difference?I don’t know. You think maybe we don’t have the same cultural touchpoints – the Vietnam war and so on. But write down all the significant events in Britain from, say, 1970 to 1998. The history is teeming with fertile ideas. We have a habit of either looking into the gutter, or at the upper classes. Either Trainspotting or Enduring Love. I wanted to try to write for people who weren’t being written about.The air of paranoia your characters live with also seems to speak to the current time.Yes, there was this distant sense in the cold war that everything might fall apart – and what is your plan B? How do you keep your family safe? For the rich, those questions were always easier: we’ll head to our holiday home. It doesn’t feel a million miles away from what we are going through now. My editor called me up and asked me if I wanted to push the publication of the book back to next year. I said no. People who have read it said they found it curiously calming in some ways. That we get through things.And history mostly happens without us?Yes, there is a great James Salter story about a man having an affair in a hotel room and afterwards they turn on the TV to see that they have just missed man walking on the moon. I have always liked that idea.Which book do you most often return to?I am not a great rereader of books. But one I have gone back to recently is Berg, by Ann Quin.Which books do you have by your bedside?They are on my Kindle. I am reading this brilliant debut novel called Machine, by Susan Steinberg. I have a collection of essays on the go called Deep Sightings and Rescue Missions by Toni Cade Bambara, a contemporary of Toni Morrison who died young. That is wonderful. And also I am reading a book called I Hotel, by Karen Tei Yamashita, which feels like it is trying to do 14 interesting things at once.• The Blind Light by Stuart Evers is published by Pan Macmillan (£18.99).

Rarely have the gambling idioms so beloved of investing commentary felt so appropriate as when the pandemic saw many companies land on zero revenues during lockdowns.In the light of such chaos, the only surprise is that there isn’t more turnover. In the words of Nicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at investment group Hargreaves Lansdown: “The world has changed since the last FTSE review at the beginning of March.”Yet only four companies are expected to drop down to the FTSE 250 at the upcoming quarterly review – a decision based on market values at the close of play on Tuesday. Still, the last time more companies than this dropped out was in 2009, during the previous major economic crisis, according to tracking by investing platform AJ Bell.Rogers met his gambler “on a train bound for nowhere”. A Covid-era cover might include a plane parked on a disused runway or a cruise ship requisitioned as a floating hospital. It’s obvious why easyJet and Carnival, the world’s largest cruise operator, are dropping out of the FTSE 100. Not even the most wary shareholders’ calculations had had a zero in the revenue column for their second-quarter forecasts. Both companies have announced thousands of job cuts as they battle for survival.The reshuffle will also show how the direct disruption from lockdowns has rippled out to companies beyond. Meggitt makes wheels and brakes for fighter jets – spending that is fairly stable throughout the economic cycle. But the freeze in the commercial aviation parts business is relegating it after its brief sojourn in the FTSE 100.Utilities are meant to be the ultimate in blue-chip companies, with boringly dependable revenues and idends. British Gas owner Centrica has done its best to buck that trend, with relegation likely to mark the end of departing chief executive Iain Conn’s reign. Conn blamed the UK government’s energy price cap for Centrica’s £1.1bn loss last year, with cancellation of its idend adding to shareholders’ pain.The contenders in line for promotion are also telling in our work-from-home, quarantine times: cybersecurity company Avast, emergency plumbers and electricians Homeserve, and medical equipment supplier Convatec.B\u0026ampQ owner Kingfisher could also come up trumps, depending on share-price moves. People stuck at home have often had nothing better to do than DIY, while its status as an “essential” retailer meant sales were not too badly hit.Another probable addition is betting company GVC. Its Coral and Ladbrokes arms have suffered a temporary hit from the pause in sports events around the world. But Premier League football is due to return on 17 June, while regular gamblers have shown no signs of holding back during lockdown. GVC’s online gaming business has proved that normal people – as well as blue-chip investors – can easily lose fortunes from the comfort of their own homes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f70d2e8e23920a6f906e778e64fae41d984f9cc/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=700489523d98153a27b895dbb9145fa8","title":"a moral obligation radical reform urged before cruise ships allowed to return to australia","story":"Unions oppose ‘business as usual’, where multinational companies earn billions from Australian passengers on ships registered in tax havens and crewed by migrant workersCruise ships and their crews have been largely out of sight and mind since being ordered out of Australian territorial waters in March. As the ill-fated Ruby Princess finally left its temporary berth in Port Kembla on 23 April with only the crew on board, the last thing on anyone’s mind was an imminent return of paying passengers on cruises heading to Australian ports.But now tickets are on sale for cruises that sail as soon as September, raising urgent questions about the future of the industry.Australia’s international cruise ship ban is now due to end on 17 September, after being extended by three months last week.One of the first ships scheduled to arrive in Australian ports is Royal Caribbean’s Ovation of the Seas, which is scheduled to leave Hawaii on 27 September, bound for Sydney. In April the ship was linked to a significant Australian Covid-19 cluster and at least two deaths, and was among more than a dozen ships that anchored off the coast of Australia in a stand-off with authorities after the order to leave.After the recent nightmare of coronavirus clusters on board ships with multinational crews, home ports on the other side of the world and owners often domiciled in tax havens, experts and industry players have urged the government to carefully consider radical change before the reintroduction of cruising to Australian waters.Some of the ships Australia sent away are among the 19 now floating in Manila bay in the Philippines. Helicopter footage shows them dotting the horizon, goliaths sleeping out the pandemic, potentially thousands of workers still trapped in their bowels.They are dormant now, but unions and seafarer advocacy groups believe this is the chance for Australia to reconsider its role in feeding these giants.“I think this is the only opportunity in my lifetime to make some changes and make these people live up to the standards that we expect,” says Dean Summers, the Australian Coordinator for the International Transport Workers Federation.“If we let them go back to business as usual, we are missing our chance.”“Australia should be paving the way for an Australian cruise ship industry. It doesn’t have to be like this, we don’t have to employ the most vulnerable people under very low conditions.”Summers says the pandemic has “exposed the underbelly” of the cruise industry, which unlike air travel is largely deregulated and decentralised.“Many of those ships are still trying to get those people off. There’s been no real breakthrough, everyone’s still suffering terribly on those ships. Many have been without pay and away from their families during the most terrible time of all their lives.”He says he has lost contact with the crew on the Ruby Princess since the ship arrived in the Philippines, and is concerned for their welfare.In May a female Ukrainian worker died after apparently jumping from the Regal Princess outside Rotterdam in the Netherlands.On the Navigator of the Seas, off the coast of Miami, 15 Romanian crew started a hunger strike in protest at not being able to disembark. Police have had to be called to other boats across the world after crews protested.The vast majority of cruise ships are registered in countries such as Panama, Bermuda and Liberia, which have limited oversight and more relaxed requirements for working conditions and pay.Low labour costs help keep the price of cruises down.While cruise liners have a comfortable financial cushion – Carnival recorded $4.8bn profit for 2018, according to a report from the University of Sydney – the lack of current cashflow is placing strain on the companies to restart operations.Justin Wastnage, a tourism industry expert from the University of Sydney, says the industry will need to cut ticket prices to restart its business.“Going forward they are going to need to offer extremely low prices to entice people back.”Australia is one of the largest markets for cruise companies, and the Maritime Union of Australia is urging the government to leverage this to change the status quo.“The Australian government not only has a unique opportunity but a moral obligation, to learn from the Covid-19 pandemic and radically reform the way the cruise ship industry is regulated before allowing operations to restart in Australian waters,” the union’s national secretary, Paddy Crumlin, says.“The Morrison government should use their strong bargaining position with multinational cruise lines desperate to restart operations to negotiate for these vessels to be registered in Australia, crewed by Australian workers, and governed by Australian laws.”“The failed model of the past, where multinational cruise lines earned billions from Australian passengers on cruise ships registered in notorious tax havens and crewed by exploited migrant workers, can’t be allowed to continue,” Crumlin says.“This failed self-regulated approach led to the debacle of the Ruby Princess, resulting in dozens of deaths, along with the situation where dozens of cruise ships were left to languish in Australian waters, with no home port to go to, inadequate medical support, and no way to repatriate crew members.”Given Australia’s relative success in containing the coronavirus spread, and the contrasting disaster unfolding in the US, there is significant doubt that thousands of passengers would be allowed to dock even by September, but Royal Caribbean is accepting booking and payments for rooms on the Ovation of the Seas.Carnival Cruise Line is also selling a number of voyages around Australia and the Pacific islands. The president of Carnival Australia and P\u0026ampO Cruises, Sture Myrmell, says it is “important that we don’t get ahead of ourselves in relation to the resumption of cruising in this region”, but there are no obvious warnings on the Carnival website that these trips may not go ahead.“It is generally well known that cruising is currently subject to a rolling pause in operations,” a Carnival spokesman says.Oceanic Cruises is using room upgrades, onboard credit and free alcohol and shore excursions to entice people to book cruises in October. Its new advertising campaign urges people to “remember the future”.Prof Marylouise McLaws, an infectious disease expert from the Univerity of NSW, says international cruises should not be accepted in Australia until there is a vaccine for Covid-19.Email:\u0026nbspsign up for our\u0026nbspdaily coronavirus newsletterApp:\u0026nbspdownload it\u0026nbspand never miss the biggest storiesPodcast:\u0026nbsplisten to our daily episodes on\u0026nbspApple Podcasts,\u0026nbspSpotify\u0026nbspor search Full Story in your favourite app“All of the efforts to date could be undone quite rapidly by allowing overseas visitors on cruise ships to leave the ship,” she says.“There are many countries around the northern hemisphere that are just not working as good global citizens to try to contain this nasty virus.”But she says there could be a pathway to allowing cruises that travel only around Australia or even New Zealand if case numbers get closer to zero.“Passengers would have to be tested as they entered the ship, and then by the time they get to another port return all negative results. If anyone tested positive then no one would be allowed off as it’s an amplifying environment. There are false negatives from the tests but it’s better than nothing,” she says.Myrmell says Carnival is encouraged by talk of a trans-Tasman bubble, but “acknowledge fully that the resumption of cruising is not straightforward”.Most major cruise lines have announced new safety procedures for reopening, including enhanced patient screening and additional hand sanitisation stations.“We will not start operations until we are fully ready to do so, with all the hygiene and other health protocols solidly in place,” the chief executive of Royal Caribbean Cruises, Richard Fain, says.“Our goal is to raise our standards to entirely new levels. We have the time, we have the determination and we have the expertise.”Myrmell says Carnival and its subsidiaries will “always comply with the conditions necessary for cruising to return as a safe holiday option”.The managing director of the Cruise Lines International Association’s Australasian branch, Joel Katz, says it is inaccurate to say the industry is unregulated.“All ships are required to operate at or above compliance with the numerous layers of strict international, national, and local laws … CLIA cruise lines support and comply with the International Labour Organization’s Maritime Labour Convention, which sets international standards addressing hours of work and rest, health and safety, and living conditions for seafarers.”But if domestic cruises do reopen, the International Transport Workers Association wants consumers to have an Australian alternative.Summers says: “We all buy clothes that are from sweatshops and slave labour around the world. I don’t think people are going to say, from a moral perspective, I’m not taking my family on the cruise. I just don’t think that will happen. But let’s look at ways to create an alternative so that they do have a choice.“I’d like to say, well from a moral perspective, there’s an Australian-flagged ship here and there’s a cheap ship from a flag of convenience, I’ll go on the Australian one and support the Australian industry. I think that’s the way forward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b23ab398f2f75298b641bc5a750547c909b9fa10/0_226_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed07fb0a84ce06d5e5947b77f21ac1da","title":"normal peoples paul mescal normal yes but swelteringly blisteringly hot","story":"The actor has been seen out and about in shorts and shades: what’s not to like?Fame is a peculiar beast, coveted by those who do not have it, and frankly pretty miserable for those who do, judging by the state of almost anyone who has been given more than a brief hint. The stars of Normal People became overnight-famous while much of the world was in some form of lockdown, leaving them to emerge as wide-eyed, wobbly-legged baby celebrities, holed up at home like (almost) everyone else. It’s little wonder that in this climate of bottled-up tension, and having been anointed by a particularly horny TV show, Paul Mescal has been on the receiving end of the largest amount of public lust I’ve seen since Fleabag introduced the Hot Priest. (Kneel? It’s Paul, actually, is what I would say, if I were a stand-up comedian in the 1970s.)Last week, the salivation spectacle reached a tipping point with a paparazzi shot of Mescal in shorts and a tracksuit jacket, apparently on the way back from the corner shop, holding two cans of pink gin and tonic, a bottle of Crabbie’s cider and a packet of prawn cocktail crisps. Mescal is 24 I, too, would have considered this to be a reasonable stab at a balanced diet when I was his age. For a nation unable to go to the pub or the cinema, or play sports, or watch them, this turned out to be the entertainment highlight of the week. “This Is Paul Mescal’s Summer, We’re Just Watching It” ran the headline on a Vice piece Buzzfeed went for “Paul Mescal Stepped Out In Shorts To Buy Drinks To-Go And People Are Thirsting So Hard” Elle offered: “Why Is This Hot Picture Of Hot Paul Mescal So Hot?” I’m no expert, but I think they kind of like him.This is not a united country. Last week, it seemed as if it could be, for a short time, especially after “I was testing my eyes” was dangled in front of us as an excuse for the inexcusable, but that quickly fractured into a frenzy of people complaining about frenzies of people and the inevitable, depressing culture wars. This photograph was as close as we got to a national consensus. I’m sure the next wave of Mescal content will be a dissection of whether he’s being objectified or not but, for now, let’s just enjoy a brief moment of distraction in the illuminating sartorial and shopping choices made by a young Irish actor, simply going about his business on a nice, sunny day. It’s been a rough week, OK? Let’s have this one nice thing.\u0026nbspGood news for TV viewers, but bad news for ducks, whose breasts are about to get pan-fried on a scale they have not experienced since the last series of MasterChef. Celebrity MasterChef was filmed just in time to not get sucked into the coming TV drought that will mean only shonky Zoom-shot home videos on prime time for the foreseeable.It doesn’t even matter that it’s the Celebrity version, the least good version. Though I will say that it does offer more in the way of potential disaster fodder, simply because people are allowed to go on it even if they’ve never so much as blinked at a microwave.When the names of contestants were released last week, the list was so obscure that it looked like the sort of thing men who haunt dusty record shops try to collect. “Yeah, I found an ultra-rare Myles Stephenson,” etc. Confusion over a series 14 X Factor winner is understandable, but when some people deemed Judy Murray to be of insufficient celebrity, I almost seared my scallops in dismay.Judy is not just the mother of Andy and Jamie Murray, as many grumbled. She was the Scottish national tennis coach, she has scores of Scottish titles of her own, she has worked to encourage the profile of female coaches and she has run grassroots initiatives aimed at encouraging more kids to play, particularly kids who don’t have access to the kinds of funds that a sport like this often demands. I don’t know if she can cook, but I have no doubt that her slice (of cake?) will be ruthless.In 1982, when Bob Thaves captioned a cartoon of Fred Astaire with “Sure he was great, but don’t forget that Ginger Rogers did everything he did… backwards and in high heels”, he had no idea of the life the quote would take on. It’s a classic, now decorating the countless soft-focus images of empowered inspirational sunsets that pepper social media.I love Dua Lipa, who seems to be a pop star with smarts, who generally swerves the bland platitudes that most singers of her notoriety settle for, afraid of ever seeming controversial, and instead finds something to say in most interviews. When she spoke to GQ recently, she gave a modern pop twist to the Ginger Rogers quote.Discussing a particular 2018 performance of One Kiss, which was awkward enough that it become a meme, she admitted that the response was hurtful. She then recalled going to a show by an unnamed “male artist that actually doesn’t do anything on stage. And they got this stellar five-star review. But then you have women who get up on stage and they’re practically doing cartwheels, costume changes – it’s a spectacle”, and even so, she said, it would be picked apart. Backwards and in high heels, then, is as true as ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3a88f39de403b703fdb917c4ec6dfe30a53365a/0_173_5100_3061/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94226b1ad592cde2f92f81215c2a81eb","title":"on my radar tim burgesss cultural highlights","story":"The Charlatans singer on lightsaber exercise routines with his son, getting Prefab Sprout on his Twitter listening party and Louis Theroux’s podcastTim Burgess was born in Salford in 1967, and joined the Charlatans in 1988.

Burgess also has a solo career and his new album, I Love The New Sky, is out now. Since lockdown, his Twitter listening parties in which people play albums together and comment online, have been a huge internet hit. He lives in Norfolk with his partner, Nik Colk Void of Factory Floor, and their son.My little boy is seven and obsessed with Star Wars, so we’ve had to subscribe to Disney+ during lockdown, which has all the films.

Its stories have a real feel-good factor, although my son’s more into the Dark Side. We also do his daily exercise for school in the garden with us practising lightsaber moves.Steve McQueen by Prefab SproutBroken Greek by Pete PaphidesPete’s a music journalist, and this is the story of his love of music as a child, and how it gave him a sense of identity. His parents had come over from Greece with great promises of work that fell through, and they ended up running a chip shop. He writes about the acts that first made sense to him as a child, like Leo Sayer and the Barron Knights, and I really got that: my equivalents were the Bay City Rollers from a few years earlier. Pop music that means the world to you when you’re young doesn’t often get written about.A friend recommended this to me: it’s Louis Theroux interviewing people who, like him, are in lockdown. The episode with Jon Ronson, who’s in New York, is great. They consider each other rivals, given they started out doing similar things, but they both seem OK about that, which is interesting. Jon talks about how Robbie Williams once called and said: “You’ve got to interview me in a haunted house!” It fell through, of course, as things do which are driven by a huge amount of bluster. I also want to mention Boy George’s podcast about self-isolating in Soho. It’s lovely to hear voices like these in your ears at the moment.99 Glimpses by SofieI’m obsessed with this song. Sofie was in her mid-20s and a DJ in America and London when she had a sudden change in her life and went back to Vienna, where she’s from. It comes across in her songs. They’re like classic Todd Rundgren or Carole King, but this one is really incredible. It starts off like… I don’t want to say John Lennon’s Imagine, but it has that same classicism about it.

But big collars are having a resurgence, this time on women’s dresses, tops and jumpsuits.The current look is less Renaissance bard and more pious puritan, and can be dramatic in scale, reaching the shoulders or even down to the belly button.“We have seen a strong demand for the giant collar blouse this spring,” says Elizabeth von der Goltz, global buying director of Net-a-Porter. In general, she says, cotton blouses with exaggerated collars have been its bestselling style for tops, with designers from It-brand Ganni to Miu Miu getting in on the trend.“The trend started on Instagram as a styling piece, often as a perfect contrast to something more masculine,” says von der Goltz.Prime examples of the look are featured on the Instagram feed of Reese Blutstein, known as double3xposure to her 305,000 followers, or Man Repeller’s Leandra Medine. Both are recent champions of the big-collared designs of French label Maison Cléo.Although expansive collars predate the pandemic, the fact that thousands of people are currently only being viewed from chest up on Zoom calls via laptops and phones has given the look a boost.  Fashion historian Amber Butchart finds a historical echo in the 1930s, as “the decade that we really start to see film costumes impacting on fashion”.Butchart cites the work of Adrian, a 1930s costume designer, who put “an emphasis above the table”. His ethos for dressing leading ladies was, she explains, that “the most important details are those that are going to be seen when she’s in close up”. It’s an idea that could have come from the handbook of modern-day social media stars.Butchart also looks to the less recent past, and says today’s collars are reminiscent of the falling-band collars of the 17th century: “a big wide collar that reached the shoulders” and took over from the extravagant Tudor ruff. Often made of expensive lace, the ruff had to be laboriously “starched, reset and re-pinned every time it was worn”, and was therefore condemned in Puritan pamphlets as “monstrous” and starched with the “devil’s liquor”. The fallen-band was made of simpler stuff, often linen, and were “associated with groups like the Oliver Cromwell’s Puritans.These were also sported by the pilgrims to America. And that, she says, is where “we get these associations with wholesomeness from”. So, she suggests, these collars could now be part of a rose-tinted nostalgia for a rosy-cheeked past. At Maison Cléo, which has been producing big-collared blouses for a few years, this year saw the introduction of vintage trims, in line with the trend for upcycling. Marie Dewet, one half of the team, says: “I think at the moment people really like getting back to the past.”Blanca Miró and María de la Orden, the team behind La Veste, who supply their (almost sold-out) collars with scalloped trimmings as separate items as well as on blouses, are\u0026nbspinspired by a different kind of past: primary school. Their necklines can be read as a progeny of the last few years’ fashion for infantilised styles.\u0026nbspWhether big collars signal Puritanism, the playground, or simply bring to mind a certain playwright – expect to see them coming soon to a small screen near you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7567cedf1c829a67ea9fa3d9a05f3d67b14f9cc7/0_0_4183_2542/master/4183.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=1fd5ddf05c6e4c52b1cb7d409152f914","title":"nick pope burnley goalkeeper england no1 football interview","story":"Burnley’s goalkeeper on his lower-league journey, learning not to fear mistakes and his desire to dislodge Jordan PickfordThe goalkeeper’s lot is the peculiarity that hides in plain sight. They train alone most of the time, their technical and fitness work being entirely bespoke, and, come match day, it is preferable that they see as little of the ball as possible. Their view of the pitch is different, fixed and detached – everything feels different – and, for them, the game is as much psychological as physical, the ultimate test of focus.Nick Pope uses words such as “singular” and “inidual”. The Burnley and\u0026nbspEngland\u0026nbspgoalkeeper remembers how as a young player, he had no\u0026nbspteammate\u0026nbspto talk him through matches, to offer positional tips. You are on your own\u0026nbspbetween the sticks\u0026nbspand the deal can seem thankless, unbalanced one in which reliability, even excellence, is taken for granted and single mistakes tarnish reputations.It takes a particular type of person to don the gloves, to follow the codes of this union.\u0026nbsp“Are you saying that we’re all mental, basically?”\u0026nbspPope says, with a chuckle.Pope is nothing of the sort. The 28-year-old has built his\u0026nbspmeteoric\u0026nbsprise on level-headedness\u0026nbspand a desire to instil calm in his teammates. It has taken him from a yo-yo around the non-leagues – Bury Town, Harrow Borough, Welling United, Cambridge\u0026nbspUnited, Aldershot Town – to League Two with York City and Bury and the Championship with Charlton, his parent club\u0026nbspnearly\u0026nbspall the while.Burnley\u0026nbspsigned\u0026nbsphim from Charlton in 2016 and he is now the club’s undisputed No 1, ahead of Joe Hart and having seen off\u0026nbspcompetition from\u0026nbspTom Heaton.\u0026nbspPope is top of the Premier League clean sheet chart for the\u0026nbspseason with 11 and then there is England. He has won two caps and, before the coronavirus shutdown, was Gareth Southgate’s second choice behind Jordan Pickford,\u0026nbsphaving started the 4-0 win in Kosovo last November.\u0026nbspIt is all a far cry from\u0026nbsphis release\u0026nbspby\u0026nbspIpswich\u0026nbspat 16.Pope recognises there are “different characters in the goalkeeping world” but, when he considers his own mentality,\u0026nbspbreaking it down piece by piece, he accepts that those who play in his position do share a “certain amount of characteristics”. It is out of necessity, he adds, and the\u0026nbspbiggest requirement has to be the hide of a rhinoceros. How else can anyone deal with\u0026nbspcatching, say, nine balls but\u0026nbspbeing pilloried and sometimes defined by\u0026nbspdropping the 10th?“Growing up as a goalkeeper, you almost get used to it – you realise that is how the land lies,” Pope says. “The ones that stick out are sometimes the mistakes,\u0026nbspthey are easily highlighted because they often cost your team a goal. The sooner you realise that is a reality, the sooner it is you accept responsibility and you find it easier to move forward. Premier League stats by Opta“Some people will just look at the mistakes, however dreadful that sounds.\u0026nbspBut as a goalkeeper, whether you like it or not, your job is to make as few mistakes as possible – along with all the other good things you can do. It’s a different responsibility.”“It’s important, too, not to go out on the pitch fearing mistakes.\u0026nbspIt\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspsomething that\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspgoing to happen. That’s why I talk about putting your mind at ease\u0026nbspto have the freedom to make brave decisions and actions.”Pope\u0026nbspstresses\u0026nbsphow goalkeepers must\u0026nbspbe “the voice at the back”, a “leader”,\u0026nbspable to organise based on “the view you have – it’s like no one else’s … you see the whole picture”. What shines through, though, is his equilibrium.“One of my goalkeeper coaches at Charlton, Lee Turner, would speak about having this middle line,” Pope says. “He used to point his arm out straight and say\u0026nbspthat you had to stay on this line as much as possible. However good or bad things were, the closer you can stay to that line, the less drastic things will be, the less of a rollercoaster.“We could score in the 89th\u0026nbspminute to go 2-1 up and, for me personally, you\u0026nbspdon’t want to run round doing knee-slides. At that point, I’m thinking about getting over the line. That’s the feeling I want. The game is done and you’ve got the three points. I don’t really have a temper and I like to be very relaxed. I’ve found it’s the best way for me to perform at my best. If a goalkeeper can have a calming influence, it’s something that can run through a team.”Pope’s top-level breakthrough came in 2017-18 when he stepped up for the seriously injured Heaton to play\u0026nbsp35 Premier League games, keeping 12 clean sheets and being named as Burnley’s player and players’ player of the season. He made his England debut as a substitute against Costa Rica in a World Cup warm-up and was the third-choice goalkeeper at the finals in Russia. There was injury last season – and frustration behind Hart and Heaton –\u0026nbspbut\u0026nbspthe temptation is to\u0026nbspthink that everything has happened\u0026nbsprelatively\u0026nbspquickly for him.The reality is that\u0026nbspthis\u0026nbsphas been only Pope’s\u0026nbspsecond season\u0026nbspas a Premier League first-choice and it has been a long road, highlighting the patience that goalkeepers must habitually show.“Experience is so important and, if you’re at a higher club,\u0026nbspit’s often a massive risk for them to play a young goalkeeper,” Pope says. “The manager might not have the time to let you develop and make mistakes at that level. So you go on loan and, as horrible as it sounds, you make those mistakes elsewhere. Then, you come back to your parent club\u0026nbspwith a grounding behind you, rather than just playing under-23s, and it gives the manager faith to chuck you in.“If you’re a young winger, for example, you can go out there, be as carefree as possible and you are less likely to be at fault for a goal. In terms of the evolution of the game, I’d be interested to see if more young goalkeepers\u0026nbspdo\u0026nbspget thrust in rather than taking the loan route.”Pope’s thoughts are on the Premier League restart, on extending Burnley’s five-match unbeaten sequence, on finishing in a European position. He has not thought about the postponed European Championship, in which the majority of England’s games are scheduled for Wembley but, when it is brought up, the excitement is palpable. He does a quick bit of maths, taking in the probability of becoming a professional footballer in the first place and then reaching the top level at a time when England have what is in effect a home tournament.“It must be billions and billions to one so to have that opportunity would be unbelievable,” Pope says. “Although I didn’t play a game at the World Cup, to be part of that was still one of the greatest things of my life. The biggest moment? Eric Dier scoring the winning penalty against Colombia. As one of the goalkeepers, I’d done a lot of work with Eric and the other lads on the penalties, so to see them perform as they did was incredible. If you could stop time and rerun the adrenaline and everything you had for those couple of moments, it would be unbelievable.”So one last thing. What does Pope have to do to dislodge Pickford? “Ha ha, good question,” he replies. “But one of my main things is not to look too far ahead. I’m really looking after myself at Burnley. England is so far away, even though being the No 1 is something that I want. It’s a real dream of mine to play at Wembley and to represent England as many times as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1684afaa5fe3449bd9888da61d102e25dbb02c7b/0_422_5022_3013/master/5022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92d8c15188c3966d7f009865febf7d9f","title":"cabin fever why people are going wild for custom garden rooms","story":"A colourful, cosy cabin at the end of the garden is a perfect way to get some more space – or getaway from it allWhen Virginia Woolf extolled the virtues of having “a room of one’s own” she might have been referring to a cabin in the garden. For anyone who’s had to work from home recently, and is in possession of a patch of outside, a garden getaway where you can labour, undisturbed by cats padding across keyboards or the tug of a toddler’s hand during a conference call, has taken on a new appeal.But a garden room needn’t just be for work. Thanks to wireless technology and efficient insulation, today’s 21st-century cabins are multi-tasking boltholes. In need of a meditation space, a studio, a guest room or cocktail lounge? The cabin can accommodate every whim.It can also suit any style. Consider the cabin your grown-up Wendy house where you can – subject to planning – unleash your architectural alter ego. “People really let their personality go wild in garden rooms as they don’t have to live with the result in the house,” says cabin designer Hamish Boden of Studio Hardie. Whimsical follies, mid-century pavilions or bohemian shepherd’s huts can all be bought off the peg or custom-made by specialist firms.Architects are partial to garden rooms because their compact footprint allows for experimentation with new materials and techniques, on a scaled-down budget. The flat-pack “folly” that architect Ben Allen designed for his brother Jonnie, partner in an engineering firm, and sister-in-law Rachel, a nutritionist, is a case in point. The octagonal room (shortlisted for an Architects’ Journal prize) was inspired by the eccentric Dunmore pineapple pavilion in Scotland, mixed with the form and colour of an artichoke.“I wanted it to be inexpensive and simple to build,” says Allen, who used digitally pre-cut ply panels, notched and drilled to slot into place, to clad the timber-framed structure that sits at the end of a south London garden. Although the cabin’s size falls within “permitted development” rights, Allen did need planning permission to raise the roof height. With the addition of a skylight, it amplifies the spacious feel of the interior where exposed timbers soar upwards, like rib vaulting in a church. “We use it all year round – as an office, somewhere to read, or for children’s parties,” says Rachel. A bench opens up to become a guest bed. The solid doors open fully in summer. In winter, underfloor heating keeps the room snug. Above the desk, a wide window overlooks the couple’s ground-floor apartment. “During lockdown I sit at my desk in the morning watching Jonnie doing his workout with the children. You always feel connected to what’s going on at home,” she adds.Potter and photographer Sarah Maingot’s studio has a different feel. Her rustic retreat was built from materials unearthed in the garden of her 18th-century cottage in the Cotswolds. “The previous owners would just throw anything they didn’t want outside. I’m always discovering something: a window, a bit of furniture,” she says. The new space, which Maingot designed with Simon Chadwick of Makers Cabins, replaced a tumble-down outhouse. “It’s evolved organically as we found things,” says Maingot, who makes her “imperfect one-of-a-kind” ceramics here. The Georgian windows were bought on eBay for £100 the oak lintels are offcuts. Inside, wood from the old shed was upcycled as wall cladding, vintage lights painted black for industrial effect and a gallery for storage added. The cabinet was another discovery. “It’s like exploring an archaeological site, full of magical finds,” she says.Luck also lies behind interior designer Kit Kemp’s getaway. She spotted her shepherd’s hut languishing, unused, in a friend’s garden. “I immediately imagined it at the end of my garden, nestled between silver birches,” says Kemp, founder of the Firmdale hotels group. But first the makeover. Kemp is known for her vivid interiors jostling with art, pattern and handwoven textiles. Her New Forest retreat, with its bohemian interior, has all these things. It also has a thatched roof, which she commissioned from local craftsman John Harman “to add a romantic layer of camouflage”. Inside, walls blaze with folkish motifs painted by decorative artist Melissa White the sofa bed is scattered with embroidered cushions by Fine Cell, a charity that works with prison inmates. “On sunny mornings I’ll sit on the verandah with a cup of coffee and the dogs join me,” says Kemp. “It’s become my sanctuary.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09b3aecf215f1858a1d232bc4fcf7b7a9bdb52d0/0_284_4257_2554/master/4257.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8031192d7c5fc7f8ca75c4d078c4a5d0","title":"bright candy colours bring summer cheer","story":"A chance purchase introduces new colours to the window boxes and roof terraceEarly summer means geraniums.

So I couldn’t bear the thought of her not looking after herself.”The couple have been together for 23 years. They met in Sydney in 1997 on a night out at a club with mutual friends. There was an instant attraction between Deb and Di. “It was really dark, there was dancing and we were sitting next to each other,” says Deb. “Our legs touched and there was electricity.” Di agrees, remembering standing outside the club and feeling Deb’s eyes sweep up her body.Although they were both living in Sydney at the time, they discovered they were both from Queensland and had grown up not far from each other. In fact, Deb’s mum had taught Di at high school. However, they’re glad they didn’t meet back then. “Luckily we never met,” says Deb. “We were in our early 40s when we met, which was the right time.”Di pursued Deb, sending a fax to the New South Wales state library, where she was working at the time. “Her excuse was that she wanted to talk about birdwatching and she had this really amusing turn of phrase that said, ‘of the feathered variety’,” Deb says with a laugh. While Di had no interest in birds, she’d picked up on Deb’s interest that night. “It was most unusual for me just being someone to pursue something,” says Di. “I’m slightly aloof most of the time. So it was obviously fate.”They knew they had something special. “Definitely,” says Di. “I remember distinctly saying and feeling, ‘I’ve met my soulmate.’ I said it quite a lot.” Deb chips in: “Within two weeks, I remember.” Di was certain they were meant to be together: “I knew very clearly that this was the person that was going to see me out. I’m going to be with her and we’ll go together to old age. That I wasn’t going to be likely to find someone else so compatible.”Deb was just as committed. “I’m less decisive than Di, but definitely I was prepared to put everything into it at that stage of the relationship, and we were just so into each other.”They had – and still have - strong physical chemistry. “That was what really connected us, we were very sexually attracted to each other,” says Di. Deb agrees: “We couldn’t go anywhere because people hated being with us, we were just so all over each other.” She laughs: “I kind of cringe to think about it.”They share similar values and politics and both enjoy being out in nature together, especially now they live in Queensland. And they balance each other out in some ways. “I’m a glass-half-empty type person,” says Di, “and she’s good like that for me, because I can immediately see the negative stuff in whatever’s going to happen, and she keeps flipping that – annoyingly sometimes. She’s got a very sunny outlook on things, which astounds me because a lot of what happens to her is not that sunny.” Deb has cultivated optimism in the darkest times to get her through. “I guess having been through major health problems, I think that has made me more just grateful to be alive.”Di adds: “You’ve got to let the other person be themselves. Because that’s the person you fell in love with – someone different.”But they don’t sweat the small stuff. “I’ve consciously taught myself I don’t need to mention all those little things that are trivial,” says Deb. “Di may not do exactly as I would do, like put the pegs in the wrong basket or something ridiculous like that … Talking’s really good but leaving things unsaid is also good.”Deb’s health battles have been a constant challenge. Di remembers watching her partner fight to get the heart transplant. “I’ve been in awe, I just watch from the sidelines going: how the hell do you keep going? I just don’t think I’d have the mental attitude to go with it.” But for Deb, Di was part of the fight, giving up work to help her when she became very unwell. “Di has really been there for me. Without her I really couldn’t have got through it.”Laughter has been their saving grace. “Being lighthearted at some things because some other things are so huge, we have to find some light,” says Di. “And keep with the light as much as possible, because if it were up to me I’d be a bit doomsday about everything.”Although they’ve been together for so long, their relationship hasn’t changed in many ways. That consistency has helped them to navigate their many challenges together. “What hasn’t changed is our ability to focus as a team really quickly ... Right from the beginning we knew, we could see that in ourselves, that ability to quickly focus and adapt. We can do.”Deb adds: “We just know practically everything about each other now. There’s not a lot of mystery to be had – but then she will always surprise me. If someone’s going to surprise me, it’ll be her.”Deb sees things plainly: “We’re committed to being together for the rest of our lives ... looking after each other and making the most of what we’ve got. We try and just live for the moment, rather than think we’re going to be alive at 80 and we need money for this or that … I can’t see myself living that long. I don’t think that’s what happens, but I just want to live the best life I can with Di.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0815bdfd2e3d143506de3521292f8b97f1cc774/0_85_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3775981db8db3a6c90503f0db2e438e3","title":"anywhere but westminster online covid 19 uk","story":"In lockdown, our series is using footage sent in from around the UK to tell the story of the world outside the political bubbleThe day after the 2019 general election we were on an early-morning train from Stoke-on-Trent to London, feeling as if a long and messy chapter of recent British history had at last come to some kind of full stop. Brexit was a certainty, the Conservatives had won a big parliamentary majority, and the Labour party was more estranged than ever from its old heartlands. Having covered a country in mounting political ferment since 2010, we thought we could at least put Anywhere but Westminster on pause.But in March, everything changed once again. As the Covid-19 crisis reached the decisive point of lockdown, we decided the series had to be reawakened. But if we were as subject to the new restrictions as anyone else, and just as scared of the virus, how could we do it?The answer has defined our experience of the past two months. Instead of travelling to places, we have issued call-outs for information about what people are living through, and footage of their lives, usually shot on their phones. In addition, often using contacts we have acquired over the past 10 years, we have approached old and new sources, and asked them to participate. A mountain of video has arrived, which we and our team have spent long days and nights combining with our own material and turning into finished films. The result, by a mixture of accident and design, has been an ongoing series of videos that tells the story of this crisis from the core of people’s actual experience.We’ve chronicled the lives of a 26-year-old man whose arthritis medication suppresses his immune system, meaning he has to live in complete isolation, and an intensive care nurse who facilitates people saying their last goodbyes via Zoom. We’ve spoken to families whose experience of lockdown is light years away from any “bake cakes and learn Spanish” cliches, and people who have spoken movingly about losing loved ones. Crucially, we have also gone out of our way to explore how communities have come together, and provided new kinds of support to friends and neighbours.Unintentionally, it feels like what we’re doing is true to most people’s experience of the crisis – and, in particular, the mixture of an often lonely world suddenly mediated via the internet, and an unexpected sense of common purpose and togetherness. It sometimes feels as if encouraging people to document their own experiences is sparking a change in the way we feel about our journalism, and presenting us with a new challenge we will have to face when the crisis recedes: how to push even further beyond the standard approaches of the media, and give an even more authentic sense of where the country is going.For now, one thing seems particularly clear. The convulsive political events of the past 10 years were at least partly about rising inequality and insecurity, and people’s sense that power was too distant. Covid-19 has highlighted those things to the point that they are even more inescapable than before – which, for us, means that the work has to go on.Stay at home, keep your distance from people and don’t mix with anyone outside of your circle: the rules of lockdown are almost the polar opposite of the rules of Anywhere but Westminster.Our process has been to get out there to places the media doesn’t normally visit, get close to people, and talk to those outside our bubble. Seeing a political media that was too socially distant, we wanted to counteract it with a kind of journalistic gap-closing.Through the ruptures of Corbynism, Brexit, and the rise of populism, the idea that there was a gap between the way politics was presented in the news and lived in the world became accepted, and even a cliche. After 10 years, I sometimes felt like one of an ageing pair of small-time bank robbers, always coming back for one last job.But coronavirus and the resulting lockdown brought us new purpose – or a new version of our old purpose. Once again, the news was dominated by images from government briefings from Westminster and political journalists trying to hold them to account – this time over Zoom. There was also a blizzard of figures: infection rates, deaths, jobs lost, workers in furlough. We wanted to give more space to ordinary people to speak – putting human stories to those numbers and policies, but also capturing the ways in which communities were coming together to help each other.Same old problem, then: the difference is that we are working from our bedrooms and putting the films together using footage sent to us by people around Britain. Like everything else about this moment, it’s been a journey of discovery, with highs and lows. I will not miss wrestling with hundreds of clips shot in different formats, sent to me along with a constant stream of messages, questions, and pinging alerts. But I have also found moments of emotion in the footage that it would be hard to match in anything I shot myself.A paradox has become clear: while the issues we cover have always been bottom-up, the process of making a film that has a narrative viewers will watch and engage with is a very top-down process, requiring lots of control in the hands of the person filming and editing. Normally we videographers film with great attention to detail, trying to get each shot just right, and capturing every aspect of a scene in sequences of shots. Now I’m in collaboration with people who don’t even hold the camera the right way round (hint: it’s not vertical). But what they lack in technical skills they have made up for in authenticity.So, in many ways, this has been a process of letting go – of the old standards that we thought were so important, and of the visual “grammar” we have taken for granted. Instead we have found value in a new kind of intimacy and sincerity that comes from people having filmed their own stories, and the greater sense of control they have in the process. And we have tried to lay open the process to the viewers. In some ways this version of Anywhere but Westminster is the most true to its original vision. Hopefully it will open up new ways of thinking about how we do our video journalism and share power with the people we report on, and at the same time encourage people to see the power in capturing and documenting these times in video for themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e60efe287d1477c1d28411ae3f6dc099a6841771/83_0_3405_2043/master/3405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f18b0acf514602c15e6b0036683204a","title":"what are your experiences of debt during the coronavirus pandemic","story":"We’d like to hear from people about how they are managing existing debts during the coronavirus pandemicSince the lockdown thousands of people have found themselves grappling with significantly reduced finances.

As a result, they are now “very concerned for the safety and wellbeing of the general public” as the lockdown measures are relaxed.\u0026nbspThe warnings came as the government’s deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam went out of his way at the daily coronavirus briefing to make clear that people in positions of authority had a duty to lead by example and obey lockdown rules.In the clearest criticism yet by a top government figure of Cummings’ actions in driving with his wife and child from London to Durham in late March, Van-Tam said: “In my opinion the rules are clear and have always been clear. In my opinion they are for the benefit of all and they apply to all.”The poll, conducted on Thursday and Friday, also shows the Conservatives’ lead over Labour has crashed from 26 points at the end of March to just four points now. Last week alone the lead was cut from 12 to four points.Just days after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, unveiled the new test, trace and isolate scheme to combat Covid-19, the top health experts say the public mood is “too fragile to cope with another over-optimistic target-based strategy”, and urge transparency over timescales and risks for the national scheme.They say people need “to see with their own eyes that the necessary infrastructure and effective systems are put in place not just rapidly, but effectively”.They also say there is now a high risk of an uncontrolled spike in new infections, hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 over the summer.One of the letter’s main authors, Prof David McCoy, director of the centre for public health at Queen Mary University, London, described the test, trace and isolate system – which aims to quarantine people with Covid-19 and those who have been in contact with them – as “a mess”.“It is not a system,” he told the Observer. “It is just a fragmented collection of different programmes with nothing really holding them together. We needed to have spent much of April organising the test and trace programme and that was not done. We have wasted the time we had bought ourselves.”Part of that failure could be blamed on Dominic Cummings, he added. “Firstly he breached the lockdown rules but also as the chief adviser to the prime minister he has to take some responsibility for the failure of the government to make a proper response to Covid.”These experts’ concerns were also shared by other scientists who worry that daily rates of new cases are still too high to make test and tracing programmes feasible. Current infection rates suggest tracking operations will be quickly overwhelmed, they say. “The total number of cases a day is still substantial and there is evidence of decreasing compliance to restrictions and people moving farther away from their homes, increasing the chance of spread to previously unaffected areas,” said Prof Rowland Kao, at Edinburgh University.On Saturday night Rosie Duffield, MP for Canterbury, said she no longer a Labour whip after she met her partner while they were living separately, in breach of coronavirus restrictions.She met him for a walk when meetings of people from different households were not allowed. “My partner and I have been attempting to navigate a difficult personal situation as responsibly as possible. I apologise that during that process, we breached the guidelines,” she said.Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, on Saturday announced plans to re-start competitive sport as the government maintained momentum towards easing the lockdown. Johnson has said that from Monday up to six people from different households can gather outdoors, including in gardens and for barbecues, so long as they keep 2 metres apart.Prof Devi Sridhar, also at Edinburgh University, said the current daily rate of thousands of new cases was unacceptably high. “Watching carefully what’s happening in east Asia and combining this with what we know so far about this virus, it does indeed feel like mistakes are being repeated,” she said. Daily new cases should be cut to double digits, or low hundreds at most, she said, while test, trace and isolate procedures are put in place and core infrastructure built up.Graham Medley, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and a member of the government’s Sage scientific advisory group, agreed that the UK was taking a risk over the loosening of lockdown because of its current relatively high incidence of infections. “There is less room for mistakes,” he added. “The precautionary principle suggests that if you are unsure about the risks, especially when the outcomes have a large impact, then you should err on the side of caution.”Four other members of the Sage committee, Prof John Edmunds, Sir Jeremy Farrar, Prof Calum Semple and Prof Peter Horby, all warned on Saturday that the government was taking a serious risk by easing the lockdown while 8,000 people a day were being infected.The number of people who have died from Covid-19 in all settings rose on Saturday by 215 to 38,376.\u0026nbspA further 2,445 people tested positive for the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d193cafe03cb28e7d6b0afb142d84d7e5a1e2ecc/0_20_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da5a25c53e848dd3e8915b1f8ddcedf6","title":"lgbtq community how have you been affected by the lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from LGBTQ+ people about their experiences during the pandemicWhile the pandemic lockdown has raised significant concerns for everyone, we want to know whether it has brought additional difficulties for the LGBTQ+ community.Being able to embrace your sexuality or gender identity has a positive impact on wellbeing and resilience.

I tried to buy some, but the demand was so great the website kept crashing.”The now infamous 60-mile round trip by Dominic Cummings to one of the north-east’s best-known tourist spots has entered political folklore. Cummings’ explanation – that the visit to Barnard Castle, on which he was accompanied by his wife and child, was undertaken to test his eyesight – has launched countless internet memes. But as Parker, a district organiser for the National Education Union (NEU), points out, the danger is that people may come to see the joke as having been at their expense, drawing their own conclusions. “I have a 14-year-old son who is autistic,” she says. “His grandparents are a vital part of his life and routines, but he hasn’t seen them for months. It was my son’s birthday last week, and, for the first time in his life, he wasn’t able to spend it with them. He had to accept the rules of lockdown. But what Cummings did undermined the basis of the discipline we need to keep up. You could see it on the beaches round here on bank holiday weekend, after the story came out. A lot more people were just thinking: ‘We’re going to get on with living.’”The fury over the Cummings affair, and its disastrous timing as the country attempts to ease lockdown restrictions without triggering a second Covid wave, prompted three local Conservative MPs to voice their concerns in a joint statement. Richard Holden, MP for North West Durham, Paul Howell, MP for Sedgefield and Dehenna Davison, MP for Bishop Auckland wrote: “Like many of our constituents, we have spent the last few days with a feeling of disappointment, anger and frustration. The last thing we want to see is an enormous collective effort being undermined by the irresponsible actions of iniduals.” But the reckless travels of Boris Johnson’s maverick adviser, and the fact that the Durham-born Cummings remains in post, are only the latest, most high-profile, grounds for local concern.The north-east currently has the highest rate of Covid infection in Britain and the transition to a safe, socially distancing new normal will be complicated, fraught and risky. Last week, as he battled to move on from the Cummings episode, Johnson announced in Thursday’s Downing Street press conference that the government’s five tests for easing lockdown were being met. But it is becoming increasingly clear that, in regions such as the north-east, the government’s authority is not what it was at the beginning of the crisis. In the words of Martin Gannon, the leader of Gateshead’s Labour-run council: “Until now, in just about every single area, everything that has been co-ordinated by the centre has been a complete and unmitigated disaster.” Somewhat under the radar, a low-key regional rebellion has begun to take place on the basis that London doesn’t always know best. For many in a region that was deindustrialised without a proper plan for its future, that has been true for more than 30 years.Two weeks ago, Gannon joined the leader of Newcastle city council, Nick Forbes, in rejecting Johnson’s decision to drop the government’s “Stay at home” slogan in favour of the new “Stay alert” formulation. “I listened to the prime minister on that Sunday night and then talked with senior colleagues,” he told the Observer. “We decided that, given the higher R rate in the north-east, the time wasn’t right to move to that message. If we had possessed the same legislative powers as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, then we would have done as they did and stayed with the lockdown as it was.”According to Alice Wiseman, Gateshead’s director of public health: “There are disproportionately high levels of deprivation and poverty here and elsewhere in the north-east. We know that, where that is the case, there will be existing public health problems and we know that the Covid disease targets people with pre-existing conditions. So we have to be ultra-cautious here in terms of advice and guidance.”The willingness to defy government advice in order to, as Gannon puts it, “do what’s best for Gateshead”, is born of bitter experience. For those on the frontline of local government, particularly in poorer areas, the coronavirus crisis has been a sometimes searing experience that has laid bare the flaws in a dysfunctional relationship with central government. Bluntly, and in common with other local authorities, Gateshead has felt neglected, bypassed and forced to pick up the pieces as things have gone wrong.\u0026nbspAs the epidemic took hold in March, Gannon and his team experienced the consequences of strategic mistakes at a national level. Promises – particularly in relation to protective equipment – were not kept. “We were flagging up the absence of PPE on a daily basis,” says Wiseman. “No care home in the region had adequate access to the equipment needed to protect their residents. PPE was absolutely critical at that stage and we just didn’t have enough. It’s still a very fragile system now. In the end, we made more plastic masks locally – working ad hoc, using any 3D printers we could find – than we got through the national system.”\u0026nbspTo the council’s astonishment, a government list of people in Gateshead who would need to be shielded and provided with food contained only 150 names. After consultation with local GPs, the council identified 15,000 locals who would need to be protected it went deep into debt to get them provisions.There was exasperation when, as belated moves were made in April to boost capacity to test for the virus, Whitehall contracted Deloitte to set up a drive-in test centre in the local Ikea car park. The town’s Queen Elizabeth hospital announced in the same month that it had established one of the biggest testing units in the country, but as the Deloitte centre was flooded with requests, locals reported they had been redirected to Barrow-in-Furness, more than 100 miles away. Swabs from the Ikea centre were sent 240 miles south to Milton Keynes to be analysed by the time results came back, they were out of date and useless for slowing the spread of infection. “There just wasn’t a clear, defined purpose behind the testing,” says Wiseman. “It was just about getting to a high number and wasn’t useful locally. Why not focus resources on the Queen Elizabeth?”One of the most disturbing episodes came as pressure was being exerted on the council and the local foundation trust to discharge untested patients back into the community and into care homes.\u0026nbsp“During the Easter weekend,” says Gannon, “I was contacted by a member of the council, whose father was in a care home. We had a situation. This was when there was great pressure to vacate beds in NHS hospitals to cope with a coming Covid surge. People were being discharged into care homes without being tested. We were pushed by government to increase the fees to care providers to encourage them to take people. This had led to a stand-off in the car park between the NHS and the home. Some homes were saying, ‘Yes, we’ll take anyone’ some were saying, ‘No, we’re not taking anyone, unless they have a certificate that they are Covid-free’. At this particular home, paramedics, family and managers from the home were arguing in the car park about it.”This was happening across the country, Wiseman points out, at a point when “homes were not getting the resources they needed to be able to fully protect residents”.\u0026nbsp“There are just so many unanswered questions: on how test and trace will work, and when it will truly be ready and operational on what the science is on transmission between and from children on what teachers or parents with vulnerable people at home are supposed to do.” A blanket approach to coming out of lockdown, she says, will not do. “We need to develop regional responses to this. Just because London or other parts of the country might be at a certain point doesn’t mean the rest of the country should follow behind.”\u0026nbspAt the Carr Hill primary school in Gateshead, the headmaster, Paul Harris, is desperate to welcome back pupils from one of the most deprived areas in the town. For the past two and a half months, the school has transformed itself into an auxiliary social service, delivering meals and offering advice to pupils’ families. “Reopening is the last thing I think about before I go to bed and it’s the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning,” says Harris. “We know how tough it is for some families. We know of some kids self-harming and instances of domestic abuse. You’re trying to balance the emotional and educational needs of the children, with any possible risk to the community and the need to protect your staff. We have more people in our community with pre-existing health conditions. Will it be a ticking time bomb?”The government’s aspiration that primaries will reopen this week to reception classes, along with year one and year six pupils, will not be met, says Gannon. Instead, from 8 June at the earliest, Gateshead schools will begin to take back\u0026nbspthose pupils who most need to be at school. “It will not be a case of following a central diktat,” he says. “In collaboration with teachers, unions and the community, an assessment will be made on the basis of need, taking into account local circumstances.” Neighbouring Newcastle, Sunderland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside have taken a similar approach. Sheffield has put back its start date, citing the advice of its own director of public health and concerns over the local infection rate.Like local authorities up and and down the country, Gateshead has racked up a mountain of debt since the epidemic began. As tax revenues and fees for parking and leisure services have collapsed, expenditure on food distribution, PPE, transport and care needs have soared. A projected £60m debt by the end of the year will eventually have to be addressed. For now though, Gannon is just focused on helping the town survive the worst of the epidemic. “I’ve stopped worrying about the money,” he says, “I’m beyond the point of worry. We’ve got to focus on getting through this next period.”For the unlocking process to be successful, the test and trace system launched by the health minister, Matt Hancock, will have to do its job. The head of the programme, Dido Harding, has warned that it will not be fully operational until the end of June. For weeks, Gannon and his team have implored central government to make use of the expertise available in local public health networks, rather than rely on Serco-trained call-centre tracers. Finally, it seems, the message might be getting through.“The tone and approach is changing. We haven’t seen any detail about extra resource but there seems to be a new willingness to work with us. We’ve been asked to draw up a plan to oversee local outbreak control. Twenty-five thousand people sat in call centres isn’t going to work. That needs to be bolted on to existing local capacity. With sexually transmitted diseases and food poisoning, we’ve been doing this kind of thing for years.”Gannon is 62 and has been involved in north-east politics for 35 years. Each week, he and his wife deliver food to his mother-in-law, who lives two miles from the Cummings parental home. “I’ve been around a long time but I’ve never seen anything as extraordinary as last week,” he marvels. “All the political capital that the prime minister expended to keep him! There was incredulity and fury.” But he hopes and believes people will not follow the former local boy’s bad example: “We need our government to have authority, legitimacy and respect.” There is a crucial rider, though. “We also need it to work with us, give us the resources we need and devolve us the power to get things right. Local institutions must be trusted and empowered on the road ahead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b70000dea432b80b385f9a5f28ff9f164f85c08/0_277_4519_2712/master/4519.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=72fef0933055fe7d611fcf9f561643ae","title":"premiership final could clash six nations as restart further delay","story":"The restart date for the Premiership looks set to be pushed back from late July until August after Gloucester said they did not expect clubs to return to training for another month. That would mean staging the play-off final in October and a clash with plans to play out the postponed Six Nations.The Premiership had been aiming to resume on 27 June and play the season to its conclusion before, after a short break, starting the 2020-21 campaign on time. That will not happen and the end of July is looking less likely, with medical experts recommending players train for at least six weeks before a resumption.That increases the likelihood of a fixture logjam. Along with this year’s postponed\u0026nbspSix Nations\u0026nbspmatch against Italy and their autumn fixtures, England could play seven matches, while Champions Cup organisers have targeted October for completing this season’s competition.“A return to training is expected to be a month away,” the Gloucester chief executive, Lance Bradley, said. “Premiership Rugby has been in discussions with the government for many weeks about when it is likely to be safe to return to playing rugby, when we can return to training and when it is likely that we will be permitted to host crowds again. Our current thoughts are that we will be training from July, but that is not confirmed yet.”Bradley said that despite government protocols being issued for the resumption of sport, “because of the specific nature of our sport we do not yet have the go-ahead to resume training: we expect to receive notification of when we will be able to do so in the first half of June.“We expect that games will start to be played once training has been under way for a few weeks. How many depends on how quickly full contact training can resume, but we expect it to be between four and eight weeks. Whether the games take place behind closed doors or not will depend upon government advice at the time.”Premiership Rugby has been planning for the rest of the season – nine rounds before the play-off semi-finals and final – to be played out at one or two grounds behind closed doors. Eight clubs have pitched to stage the games, but the longer the resumption is delayed the greater the hope that fans, albeit in reduced numbers, will be allowed in.“The rules and recommendations are changing on an almost daily basis,” said Bradley. “We are exploring every possible option, including if we may be able to have a smaller crowd, socially distanced, within Kingsholm. Nothing is definite as we are facing an unprecedented and rapidly changing scenario. It is, however, absolutely still the plan to finish the 2019-20 season.”Gloucester are using the extra time to consider their options as they search for a new head coach to replace Johan Ackermann, who has moved to Japan. They have drawn up a shortlist and the frontrunners are believed to be the club’s skills coach, Rory Teague, and the former Wales and Lions assistant coach Rob Howley, whose ban for breaching betting regulations ends this month. “We plan to make an announcement in early July,” said Bradley.The shutdown has hit Premiership clubs hard financially, with Exeter expecting to record their first loss since being promoted to the Premiership 10 years ago. “We are all affected by the significant and challenging trading conditions we are facing and will continue to face in the ongoing economic environment, a crisis the like of which the world has not seen the second world war,” admitted Bradley.“There are one or two clubs with extremely rich owners who may be less concerned, but the shutdown has cost us a significant amount of money, although we are in a better financial position than many.”Finance is the reason the clubs are determined to finish the season, but an August start would push back the beginning of the new campaign to November. The restart date may not be a problem, with the Six Nations and Rugby Championship countries planning another meeting on 15 June to discuss a global calendar.Reports in France said there were two options on the table. The first would involve the three major leagues in Europe starting their campaigns in January 2021 and playing eight rounds before breaking in March, when the Six Nations and Rugby Championship would be played in tandem. The clubs would resume in late April and play through to the end of September, although it would mean the Lions tour to South Africa being pushed back to October, along with the other summer tours, before Europe’s November Test window.The second option would see the two championships being played in their current slots and club seasons played in one block from March. It would shorten the campaign but mean that leading players were available throughout, although subject to rest periods. Nothing will be decided without input from clubs and players’ associations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03c4ca392ed3157810d2eb0f93f410046faefaa0/0_84_5205_3124/master/5205.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40c7ae3c4b3f7be92d772f638c2d7223","title":"sport resume behind closed doors england june government green light horse racing premier league","story":"“The British sporting recovery has begun,” declared the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, as he announced that professional sport in England can resume from Monday, paving the way for the first domestic live action in almost three months.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press briefing, Dowden said the government had settled on a set of strict conditions that must be followed for sports to be allowed to return behind closed doors. The rules form stage three of the process of bringing sport back from the coronavirus lockdown. Stage two, which allowed for close-contact training for elite athletes, was published last Monday.“The wait is over. Live British sport will shortly be back on in safe and carefully controlled environments,” he said. “This guidance provides the safe framework for sports to resume competitions.“It is now up to inidual sports to confirm they can meet these protocols and decide when it’s right for them to restart. This is a significant moment for British sport. By working with clinicians every step of the way, we are creating the safest possible environments for everyone involved.”That means the Premier League can go ahead with its planned restart on 17 June – “I can now make it official: football is coming back,” said Dowden.There was further encouragement for the Premier League with the news that from 1,130 Covid-19 tests conducted on players and staff on Thursday and Friday, none had returned a positive. However, the EFL followed up with results of its own, reporting 10 positive tests from eight clubs in the Championship and seven positives from three clubs in League Two. There is no programme of testing for League One at present.A packed schedule of horse racing begins at Newcastle on Monday and builds quickly to Newmarket’s 2,000 Guineas classic on Saturday.“It’s up to each inidual sport to decide exactly when to resume competition they know their sports best,” Dowden continued. “But football, tennis, horse racing, Formula One, cricket, golf, rugby, snooker and others are set to return to our screens shortly, with horse racing first out of the gate in the north-east next week.”The guidelines, which he said had been developed at dozens of meetings with chief medical officers from a range of sporting bodies, require venues to put in place a screening process to detect coronavirus symptoms on entry, a one-way system for people and vehicles, minimal use of dressing rooms and for social distancing to be maintained where possible.A third of the Premier League’s remaining 92 games will be broadcast free to air, which Dowden said followed his own intervention. “This is an open invitation for all fans to be part of this significant moment in our sporting history,” he said, adding that it would also encourage fans to stay at home to watch.He included encouraging words for women’s sport, saying he would try to identify ways to recover the momentum lost along with some major events. “Visibility matters and our daughters deserve to see female athletes on the main stage.”Richard Masters, chief executive of the Premier League, welcomed the news but described the 17 June restart as provisional. “There is still much work to be done to ensure the safety of everyone involved,” he said. “This includes consulting with our clubs, players and managers - along with all our other stakeholders - as the health and welfare of our participants and supporters is our priority.”Dowden’s news does not apply to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland and there was a warning that Scottish football might struggle to meet the 1 August date set for its own return. Jason Leitch, the Scottish government’s national clinical director, said it depended on “a fair wind and the virus behaving itself, and of course the population behaving itself”.Frankie Dettori was among the first to welcome the government’s announcement. “It’s fantastic news,” said the veteran jockey, who believes his sport is now well placed to hog the limelight for a short time. “We’ve got two weeks’ start on football, the whole country’s starved of sport and racing in this country is of the highest quality. People will be able to enjoy our sport on the box and I have no doubt we can put on a good show for everyone.”Monday’s resumption of racing at Newcastle was so over-subscribed that 198 entrants had to be turned away. Dettori will make his own return to action at Kempton the next day but is already looking forward to Friday at Newmarket, when he will ride Straarius in the Coronation Cup, taking on last year’s Derby winner, Anthony Van Dyck. It is one of 21 races due to be screened by ITV next weekend.“It’s like, wow,” said Dettori, relishing the imminence of such quality racing. “Great horses are ready to go. If everything goes smooth, we’ll be able to catch up on the Classics and by the end of July the programme of horse racing will be back to normal.”The lobbying methods and public pronouncements of racing’s ruling body, the British Horseracing Authority, have been criticised, but Dettori was happy to give them credit. “We put a great proposal to the government. The BHA and the horsemen have worked tirelessly. We’re going to be taking precautions on top of precautions.“I’ve been riding out with a mask on, to get used to it. I’ve been talking to my French colleagues, they told me it’s a little bit of a hindrance, it’s stopping your air-flow, but I’m getting my body used to it and I have no problem at all.”Asked if the news was a relief, Dettori said: “I think more for my wife and kids, they’ll be happy to see the back of me, to be honest. We are arguing about stupid things at the moment, who did not empty the dishwasher, who took the last ice cream. I’m getting the sign that it’s about time for me to leave the house and go to work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebf8a909b69a56848122d5b168e2bd2daa3d5c37/0_540_5630_3378/master/5630.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=707f361b0d7c4e3491f2d372286dfc48","title":"hottest front room seats the best theatre and dance to watch online","story":"From live-streams of new plays to classics from the archive, here are some of the top shows online now or coming soon – this page is updated daily has partnered with the Unicorn to present a digital theatre series inspired by its 2019 production Anansi the Spider.

The Twin Cities, comprising the conjoined urban areas of Minneapolis and St Paul, regularly tops the list of places in the US with the best quality of living.Largely low rise and sprawling, set around the cities’ lakes and the Mississippi, the area is marked by affordable and largely good quality housing with lawns, parks, museums and tree-lined streets.Its politics too have long reflected a strong progressive strand, represented by figures such as the late senator Paul Wellstone, once described as the most liberal member of the Senate. Employment – pre-pandemic, at least – was high, and St Paul serves as the global headquarters for 3M.But there is another side to living in Minnesota, often ignored. Factor in the black and ethnic minority experience, and the state is suddenly not such a good place to live.Despite Minneapolis celebrating itself as the city of Prince and Paisley Park, Minnesota’s black education and employment outcomes by US national standards have long been dismal in comparison with those of the state’s white population.Rated in 2018 second in terms of overall best states in which to live in the US, in the same year Minnesota ranked close to the bottom for both employment gap by race (47th) and income gap by race (38th).\u0026nbspDespite having a white mayor, Jacob Frey, who has been outspoken about the problems of structural racism, and being located in the same congressional district that elected Ilhan Omar, the state’s first non-white woman to be elected to Congress, race relations have foundered on chronic inequalities and a series of high-profile killings of black people involving the 800-strong police force.As the academic Samuel Myers, who coined the notion of the Minnesota paradox, pointed out two years ago, it is not only in employment and income gaps that the paradox exists, pointing to racial disparities in incarceration rates, in child maltreatment report rates, educational outcomes, and even racial disparities in drowning rates.Among all these indicators, it is education that has witnessed one of the worst disparities, despite this being acknowledged as a problem by state officials and leading to a current restructuring effort to try to address the inequalities.Add to all that the dangerous accelerant of the issue of police violence against black people, including the police shootings of Philando Castile in 2016 and Jamar Clark in 2015, which led to protests that shut down some of the city’s highways, and what occurred this week becomes more understandable.Finally, as one resident pointed out to the , the impact of the coronavirus – not least its devastating economic impact on the poorest and least protected communities – has fed the simmering anger that existed before George Floyd’s killing.All of which has left a journey along Minneapolis’s historic east-west thoroughfare Lake Street, location of the 3rd police precinct which was attacked after the Floyd killing, as a metaphor for many of the tensions.A longtime magnet for new immigrants, from Scandinavians in the 19th century through black Americans during the Great Migration and those who relocated from cities such as Chicago in the 60s and 70s, to Hiic, Hmong and most recently Somali immigrants, this street underlines the disparities.Running from uptown with its wealthy homes, and bookended by the middle class neighborhoods close to the river where Black Lives Matter placards proliferated on lawns in 2016 after Castile’s killing, it also traverses poorer neighborhoods with immigrant-run businesses.It was not always this way. While race relations in the state have largely mirrored the wider experience of the US, the Twin Cites in the 60s and 70s were seen for the African Americans who relocated there as a place with access to jobs and good schooling.But race in Minnesota has become foregrounded even more in the Trump era, as some local rightwing politicians in towns such as Saint Cloud, outside the metropolitan area, have fostered anti-immigrant sentiment aimed largely at Somalis and Latinos.All of which led Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor to write in the New York Times that what is “unmistakable in the bitter protests in Minneapolis and around the country is the sense that the state is either complicit or incapable of effecting substantive change”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c37b5dd8f48949b75422881a12be8b885301bb1/0_207_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41c35cec113bff887f1611c3478cb366","title":"coronavirus heatwaves health summer us cities","story":"As underserved populations face hotter neighborhoods and limited access to air conditioning, the pandemic threatens the malls and libraries where they typically find reliefTemperatures in some California cities this week broke decades-old records. The heatwave that cooked Las Vegas over the past few days brought temperatures over 100F. And in Phoenix, highs this weekend are expected to approach or exceed 110F.\u0026nbspThis year is on track to be one of the hottest on record, and public health officials worry that in cities across the US, summer heatwaves will collide with the coronavirus pandemic, with deadly consequences for poor, minority and older populations.\u0026nbspEven before the pandemic hit, heat was killing more Americans than all other natural disasters combined. People who live in cities are especially vulnerable to heatwaves because of a phenomenon called the “urban heat island effect” –\u0026nbspcities with populations of 1 million or more can be up to 5F hotter than surrounding areas due to high population density, a lack of greenery and shade, and because materials like steel, concrete and asphalt tend to absorb more heat.\u0026nbspAnalyses have also found that cities’ poorest neighborhoods tend to be hotter, and that many low-income families have been struggling to cope for years. In some neighborhoods of Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, up to a third or more of households lack air conditioning. Due to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, many more are unable to pay to run their ACs. And even as cities begin reopening after lockdown, many of the malls, public libraries and recreation centers where overheated Americans traditionally went to cool down remain risky, especially for older people and others with a heightened risk of dying from Covid-19.\u0026nbspThroughout the country, public health officials told the  they were scrambling to find ways to protect the most vulnerable from the dual threats of heat and coronavirus. “This summer is definitely not going to be like any other summer,” said Deanne Criswell, the commissioner of New York City Emergency Management. “We’re not going to have the same level of facilities open that New Yorkers typically go to all the time to stay cool. It’s a big concern.”\u0026nbspNew York is in the process of installing 74,000 air conditioners in the homes of low-income seniors, according to Criswell. The city is also seeking to help more people pay for electricity this summer, as the unemployment crisis leaves thousands of New Yorkers without the means to make rent and utilities. Other cities across the US have asked utility companies not to shut off service this summer, even if customers can’t pay bills, so that they have access to water, cooling and refrigeration through the hottest days.\u0026nbsp“Every summer we worry about the heat when it ramps up – especially in April and May before people have a chance to acclimatize,” said Carolyn Levering, the emergency management administrator for Las Vegas.\u0026nbsp“I think it just gives us extra concern this year because of the pandemic.”In Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles, officials are keeping some cooling centers – designated public buildings where residents come for cold water and a respite from the heat – open, at a reduced capacity so people can maintain social distancing while seeking relief from the heat. At five cooling centers in LA, anyone who enters has their temperature checked and is required to wear a mask and remain 6ft away from other people. In Nevada’s Clark county, which includes Las Vegas, four cooling centers stayed open during the most recent heatwave.\u0026nbspBut none of these solutions are broad enough to catch everyone at risk of dying from heatstroke, advocates say. “Hell no, it isn’t enough,” said Jonathan Parfrey, the executive director of the LA-based non-profit Climate Resolve. “This is just a staggering problem.”\u0026nbspThe vast majority of these heat-related deaths in cities occur inside homes that aren’t air-conditioned, said New York’s Criswell.“That ain’t going to be me this year,” said Collette McCoy-Douglas, 67, a retired nurse who lives in a public housing facility for seniors in Chicago. McCoy-Douglas said her building turned on the central air conditioning a day early, after residents complained during the heatwave over Memorial Day weekend. But the system, which only cools each apartment’s living room, “felt warm when I touched it,” she said. Her thermostat read 100F.\u0026nbsp“So I’ve poured ice on my head twice today – it messed up my hair, but it helped,” she laughed.A spokesperson for Chicago Housing Authority said it was not aware of any air conditioning issues at senior housing facilities.\u0026nbspAlthough McCoy-Douglas considered looking for someplace cool she could go, she decided against it. “I’ve got an autoimmune disease, I have asthma, I have stents,” she said. “I’m more skeptical against the coronavirus.” Unable to cool down, she eventually picked up a neighbor, an older woman with cerebral palsy, and they drove around for a bit in McCoy-Douglas’s air-conditioned car. Chicago’s infamous 1995 heatwave, which killed more than 700 people, was on the minds of both women.\u0026nbsp“You know, in my apartment, we have people with mental illness and disabilities. They can’t even leave the building,” said McCoy-Douglas, who also knew of two neighbors who had died of Covid-19. “It just breaks my heart. It’s just inhuman.”\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4c82a541b5b9af43bdf0e9fcff46d8e5841d02c/0_300_4695_2817/master/4695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73c8637b24e1cffecd74391e0cda8061","title":"hawaii navy military pacific missile range facility","story":"Kauai has one of the Pentagon’s most valued testing sites. It’s an economic driver, but some residents say the military shouldn’t be on the islands at allHawaii’s “garden island”, Kauai, is known for its breathtaking scenery and laid-back vibe, a place of plunging waterfalls and cliffs cloaked in green tropical forests. But beyond its beauty it is one of the Pentagon’s most valued testing and training sites in the Pacific.In Hawaii, where the military is the second-largest economic driver, after tourism, weapons testing and training enjoy widespread support, but some residents view the islands’ highly militarized state as misguided or even\u0026nbspillegal.In missile defense circles, Kauai is known for its outsized role in weapons testing at the navy’s Pacific Missile Range Facility Barking Sands (PMRF), which its commanding officer, Capt Timothy Young, likens to a sports stadium that provides a venue for customers (weapons manufacturers, government agencies and military branches) to train people or test new technology.That technology includes ballistic missiles, rockets, drones and hypersonic weapons. In March at PMRF, the US navy and army collaborated in the test launch of a common-hypersonic glide body, which the Pentagon described as a major milestone in its goal to enhance its “hypersonic warfighting capabilities in the early- to mid-2020s”. Donald Trump said China and Russia had left the US no choice but to develop hypersonic weapons, which\u0026nbsphe described\u0026nbspas “super duper” missiles.\u0026nbspHypersonic weapons fly faster than five times the speed of sound, making it possible to hit targets thousands of miles away in minutes. The US, Russia and China are all investing heavily in them.Young declined an in-person interview but in an email said: “We test systems and facilitate the fleet’s training that ultimately enable our safety and security.”As the island’s third-largest employer, PMRF also provides jobs that are attractive in a community where the tourism and service sector often pay less and are vulnerable during disruptions like the coronavirus pandemic and associated mandatory 14-day quarantine for all visitors from outside the islands.Young said he appreciated the relationship the base has with multi-generational Hawaiian families. He added that PMRF partnered with local businesses to encourage science, technology, reading and math education. “It’s not only the right thing to do when helping to educate our young people, but it also makes good business sense to develop a local workforce.”PMRF will soon be offering even more jobs on the island as Hawaii’s air national guard stands up the 293rd offensive space control squadron using existing infrastructure on the base.The squadron will be one of four units administered by the national guard in California, Colorado, Florida and Hawaii. Tasked with space electronic warfare, the squadron’s primary mission will be “to protect and defend satellite communications systems”, said Ryan Okahara, the Hawaii air national guard brigadier general.Kauai’s mayor, Derek SK Kawakami, welcomes the military presence, saying PMRF sets a good example of how a military base can be embraced by the community through its volunteer efforts, emergency relief contributions, public outreach and openness to civilians.“Whether we have a military here or not, if we’re making enemies out there, we’re a target and so it’s best to have at least a shield of defense to protect our people,” Kawakami said. “Because we have a presence here, it makes us less vulnerable than not having a presence.“Historically, Hawaii has been a strategic location for national and international defense,” the mayor continued. “I understand many people may have mixed feelings about that. For myself, I understand the importance of keeping our nation protected and our state protected.”Critics of Hawaii’s large military presence are less sanguine.Kyle Kajihiro, an instructor with the department of geography and environment at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said: “The technologies involved in these space programs are not only for defense they can also enhance offensive capabilities. The expansion of these programs in Hawaii would cause countries who may be in the crosshairs of US war plans to perceive us as a threat.“History teaches us what happens when other powerful countries weaponize our islands … If the 2018 false missile alert did anything positive, it forced a conversation about how the massive military presence puts a big target over these islands.”Sparky Rodrigues, a Native Hawaiian activist opposed to the military in Hawaii, called the US military presence, which dates back to the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, an illegal occupation. The bombing of Pearl Harbor, Rodrigues said, wasn’t an attack on Hawaii but on the US military.“They have basically occupied the space, taken the land, denied access to our resources from long ago, and we are now stuck with them holding the checkbook that supports our families.”That sentiment has caused a rift in the Hawaiian community. “We are being poisoned and fed at the same time,” Rodrigues said. “The military has poisoned our economy, they’ve poisoned our land, they’ve poisoned the air. Every time they do training and missile firing, there’s contamination that goes into the environment … I don’t want Hawaii to be known as the purveyor of death.”Base proponents value PMRF as a facility that can accommodate testing and training below the sea, on land, in the sky and in space. In 2018, Japan’s ground self-defense forces achieved a first when they launched Type 12 surface-to-surface missiles and Himars rockets at PMRF during the huge Rim of the Pacific maritime exercises.PMRF also hosts the Kauai test facility, operated by Sandia, one of the department of energy’s national nuclear laboratories. KTF, which has operated on Kauai since 1962, has supported more than 450 launches, including a series of experimental rocket tests in 2019 to test new technologies being considered for future nuclear weapons life-extension programs.Two of PMRF’s most important functions have been for testing Lockheed Martin’s Aegis Ashore and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems.Thaad, which is intended to neutralize short-, medium- and limited intermediate-range ballistic missiles, is deployed in Guam, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Israel and South Korea.Aegis Ashore, a land adaptation of a ship-based BMD system, was introduced to a US naval base in Romania in 2016 and will deployed at a missile defense facility in Poland where it is years behind schedule and $96m over budget.Japan also plans to deploy Aegis Ashore in two locations by 2025. In 2019 and earlier this year, Japan’s defense minister traveled to PMRF to inspect the system. And while Tokyo and Washington insist Aegis Ashore is meant to defend against North Korea and Iran, both Moscow and Beijing see the system as an offensive threat.Patrick Shanahan, the former acting secretary of defense, may have stoked those fears when he announced US policy would “shift towards greater integration of offensive and defensive capabilities because missile defense necessarily includes missile offense”.PMRF’s expanding role comes at a time of heightened tensions between the US and Russia, China, North Korea and Iran. What’s more, countries around the world are facing the coronavirus pandemic and an economic freefall, with markets plunging, businesses collapsing and the world driven into crisis.The\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspCongress\u0026nbsphas already passed nearly $3tn in\u0026nbspemergency response packages to the Covid-19 pandemic, as the Trump administration’s 2021 budget sharply increases spending on nuclear weapons, including a new low-yield submarine-launched nuclear weapon and a spending surge on intercontinental ballistic missiles.With the 2019 demise of the INF treaty, the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, growing worries that the US appears poised to abandon the bilateral New Start treaty, which might not be renewed in 2021, and the US Missile Defense Agency seeking new ways to use BMD systems, PMRF’s role appears likely to grow.William Hartung, the director of the arms and security project at the Center for International Policy, worries about the lack of public awareness of dramatic policy shifts or scrutiny of emerging technologies, such as hypersonic weapons, that reduce an already short response time to missile launches, as well as the further weaponization of space.“I think the economic impact of these military facilities all over the country is a big obstacle to changing how we spend our money, what kind of weapons are pursued, what nuclear policy we have, how we approach space,” Hartung said.“Because these places become entrenched, local communities depend on them economically and then there’s less inclination to question the value or the danger of the activities that are going on.”In the face of institutionalized military opacity, Hartung said there was an incentive for the military to avoid openness because “transparency can lead to criticism, criticism can lead to changes in policy, and so if they can stick to generic language and general boilerplate it may serve their interests. But they’re sort of short-term interests, they’re parochial interests.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8ba71b5578509f78e95ff044b0ecbd1ea19a5cf/156_345_3237_1942/master/3237.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d079b6fb29489f241b32726686efd088","title":"from evasion to evisceration how the dominic cummings lockdown story unfolded durham","story":"As thousands died, the story of the PM’s top adviser waxed and waned in unpredictable ways. Its impact is as yet unknownThe first inkling of the story that shook Downing Street to its core came at the beginning of April.It was the first Sunday of the month, a couple of hours before the Queen’s stirring promise to the nation that, however hard it was to endure separation from our loved ones, “we will meet again”. Boris Johnson was seriously ill, and that evening it would be announced that the prime minister had been admitted to hospital.As it would turn out, however, one of the most consequential news events of the day was one almost nobody knew about. had been told that Dominic Cummings, the cartoon bogeyman of remain voters and the liberal left, was listening to Dancing Queen in his parents’ front drive.The Cummings family property is on a fast-moving A road and almost completely hidden behind bushes.The chances of anyone spotting a special adviser enjoying a bit of Abba during quarantine – much less recognising him – were slim enough that you could see why you might not be particularly worried about it. But as it happened, someone did see. And they wanted the  to know.Could Dominic Cummings, the architect of the “Stay home” campaign that every minister was imploring the nation to follow, really have gone to Durham?  asked a straightforward question of No 10. The response was enough to make you wonder: “It’ll be a no comment on that one. We wouldn’t get into locations of inidual members of staff.”That oddly evasive reply warranted further investigation. And by the end of that week, there was enough corroborating detail to go back to Downing Street. A new set of questions about the senior adviser’s locations, now loaded with specific details, was again met with a flat refusal to comment.It was Friday, 10 April. Exactly six weeks later, when the  and Daily Mirror made a final approach for comment before that evening’s publication, Downing Street would complain that they had not been given enough time.Over the intervening period, as hundreds more deaths were reported each day and the rest of the country wondered when the dull nightmare of lockdown would end, the story rushed forward and receded in unpredictable ways.The attempts to put the media off the scent, however, were not confined to gnomic remarks from Downing Street, which at one point had told another journalist that Cummings was “at home”.Cummings’ wife, Mary Wakefield, wrote a piece for the Spectator (subscription) – which she also read out on Radio 4 – that was so artfully constructed that on a casual read it seemed to rule out the possibility that the family had left their home at all.And surely Cummings would think it foolish to write a sidebar to this article, reflecting on the same period, if the family idyll he described was more than 250 miles from home?On a second look, though, both articles were curiously devoid of geographical specifics, until Wakefield finally referred to the family “emerging … into the almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown”. The line implied  they had been cocooned within the capital all along but, tantalisingly, stopped short of saying so outright.Downing Street’s reticence to come clean was understandable.In early May, the government scientist Prof Neil Ferguson was forced to resign after the Daily  splashed on the revelation that his lover had visited him at home. Cabinet ministers jumped on the indiscretion, proclaiming he was right to quit.But the wriggling and obfuscation would come to a spectacular end – and from an unlikely source.In response to a question from the Mirror, with whom the  had agreed to work, Durham police provided a statement confirming that the force had spoken to the family about Cummings’ visit.At 8pm on 22 May, both newspapers published their stories.The internet was swiftly awash with indignation and calls for the special adviser to resign.Downing Street was still declining to speak to the  on the record, while simultaneously providing other media with anonymous source quotes condemning the stories as “fake news”.Two of the country’s most eminent behavioural scientists got the news as they ate dinner together last Friday night, and immediately recognised the gravity of what had been disclosed, not as a matter of political drama, but as a profound risk to public adherence to the lockdown rules.“We looked at each other and said: ‘What is this?’,” said Robert West, a professor of health psychology at University College London, whose wife, Susan Michie, is director of the same university’s Centre for Behaviour Change and a fellow attendee of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies’ behavioural sub-group.“We had a very strong sense right away that something was up,” West said. “There were already concerns about how on earth we’re going to move to the next phase when messaging trust is ebbing away. And then this was like a bombshell.”The next morning, Downing Street provided the kind of detailed statement that the  had been seeking for weeks. But it brought as much confusion as clarity.A spokesman confirmed the trip, saying that it was “essential … to ensure his young child could be properly cared for”.That line – later justified by an explanation that a conversation with Cummings’ father had been at his request and primarily about security matters rather than a breach of lockdown – is understood to have caused consternation at the Durham force, which found itself at the centre of a political storm, and was forced to reiterate that a conversation had indeed taken place. (Two days later, it would say that the call focused on security.)But amid cries for clarity, little further information was on offer.Cummings refused to let Downing Street issue a statement on his behalf, the Sunday Times reported, with one insider being quoted as saying: “He insisted on handling it all himself.”If Downing Street had calculated that a stonewall strategy would make the story go away, they could hardly have been more wrong – thanks largely to a retired chemistry teacher. Robin Lees got in touch with the  via email. “Just read your report in the  and straight away reminded of an experience in Barnard Castle where I live on April 12th this year,” he wrote, before going on to describe his sighting of Cummings, and adding: “I went home and told my wife, but we thought he must be in London.”Lees had written down a number plate immediately, he added, and Googled it as soon as he got home – a claim corroborated by his search history.Hearing the transport secretary’s attempt to justify the visit by saying that Cummings had hunkered down and had not moved around, Lees was indignant. “Sorry if this has led you off at a tangent,” he wrote. “But Grant Shapps kept saying he stayed in one place!”After new stories were published by the Observer and Sunday Mirror that evening, featuring the Barnard Castle account as well as a separate allegation – consistently denied – of a later visit to the area, the “stay put” defence slid out of the government’s story, to be replaced by a fierce critique of “campaigning newspapers”.But if that was an attempt to define the subject as being one restricted to ideological left-wing interest, the response on Sunday and afterwards made it impossible to sustain. Led by the avowed Brexiter (and Cummings opponent) Steve Baker, Conservative MPs started to call for his resignation with tens of thousands of angry messages sent by constituents, almost 50 more had done so by Friday.The Daily Mail published a ferocious splash on Monday morning, with the headline: WHAT PLANET ARE THEY ON?Meanwhile, TV and radio producers reported difficulty persuading all but a small cast of loyalists to defend Cummings’ position on air, with one saying: “Quite a lot of the usual suspects were actually furious about it. If you listened, the same people popped up again and again.”Polls emerged showing a clear majority of the public felt the adviser had broken the rules, and ought to resign. It was time for the government to try a different approach: they promised us a rose garden.Like all good as, Cummings came out to greet his audience on Downing Street’s sunlit back lawn half an hour late. Despite the wait, his nearly unprecedented press conference drew a live TV audience of 5.5 million. In an extraordinary prepared statement, he laid out a complex story of difficult personal circumstances, ingenious and necessary solutions, and dismayingly compromised eyesight.Even as he spoke, though, there was little sense that the firestorm would abate. Steven Swinford, the deputy political editor of the Times, tweeted that cabinet ministers were unsatisfied: “He’s saying he’s so much more important than us plebs,” one told him. Another concluded: “We’re losing trust and confidence – it’s draining away before our eyes.”And there were oddities and inconsistencies even in the story that Cummings had set out in such extraordinary detail. Wakefield can drive, or at least could in 2000, when she wrote in a Spectator travel piece about a trip to Texas: “I drove for an hour every morning, slaloming past the road-rage wrecks of battered trucks, up the 135 from Dallas to Denton.”And if he had only gone to the “outskirts” of Barnard Castle, as he claimed, why had he been sighted parked up on the far side of the river from the route he was most likely to have taken?But such queries were unavailable to the journalists at the briefing, who, in line with normal Downing Street practice, had had to give up their phones before going in. The rose garden appearance did not calm the public mood – and, perhaps most troubling of all for a government seeking to have its messaging taken wholly seriously, stoked widespread ridicule. Memes abounded, including “Should have gone to Barnard Castle” riffs on the famous Specsavers ad. Staff could “hardly believe it”, said Maria Sattar, the opthalmic director in the company’s Barnard Castle branch, who noted that the spoofs “gave us a chuckle”. One Twitter account showed a page from Brewer’s slang dictionary which, if real, said “Barney Castle” was existing slang for a “pathetic excuse” deriving from a 16th century general’s refusal to leave his fortified position there to engage in battle. And the comedian Paddy McGuinness posted a reworked version of (Is This The\u0026nbspWay To) Amarillo, concluding in a rousing chorus of “sha la la la la la bullshit”.Durham’s acting police and crime commissioner, Steve White, could sense the danger and urged the force to “establish the facts” around the claims.He’d been listening to the “vox pops” from Barnard Castle on the Sunday night news, not far from his home.“When people think that we’re fibbing, that we’re under the thumb of No 10, that’s when it starts to become an issue for me,” he said. “Seeing that dismay and anger at what people were hearing – we have to demonstrate that whatever else is going on, they can trust Durham police.“That’s when I had to act.” That move eventually led the force to the conclusion on Thursday that Cummings may have committed a “minor breach” of the lockdown rules.By then, 100 or more Tory MPs had criticised Cummings or called for him to go every ministerial briefing and interview had been dominated by the furore, and the government’s poll ratings had tumbled under the weight of middle-England indignation.Yet Cummings was still in place.The more significant question, of what this will mean for public adherence to lockdown and the new test-and-trace system, is yet to be answered.West, the behavioural scientist, says that an earlier resignation or admission of culpability would have been far better, but that the situation could still, theoretically, be improved.“It’s possible the damage will be mitigated by other people stepping in and saying: ‘Don’t do it for Cummings, do it for the community,’” he said. “But it’s like trying to climb an escalator when it’s going down. It’s not a question of whether lives will be lost now it’s a question of how many. But there is still some point in someone acting. Even too little too late can be enough, and in time.”For the sources who took the chance of coming forward, meanwhile, there has been at least some sense of vindication.Lees received an unsigned postcard addressed to the “Retired chemistry teacher” of Barnard Castle. “I presume this is for you,” the postal worker told him. “Thank you for being so brave,” the message read."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8585f1425ff24aa67d7e97517c6304d3c2c8746b/0_75_5171_3105/master/5171.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=111c24c97462e76ec14d78e4b7e45bb2","title":"uk lockdown rules what are the key changes","story":"Varying rules for meeting outside will apply in England, Wales and Scotland The prime minister announced on Thursday that groups of up to six people could meet outdoors in England from Monday, permitting what he described as “a long-awaited and joyful moment” as family and friends reunite after 10 weeks in lockdown. He set out the next stage in the easing of restrictions with a caveat that “there may still be some anomalies, or apparent inconsistencies, in these rules”.The UK government was yet to publish the promised guidance on the new rules on Friday afternoon but here is what has been announced so far.Yes. Whereas people in England were previously allowed to meet one person from another household outside while maintaining a two-metre distance, from Monday, groups of up to six will be allowed to meet. People will be permitted to congregate in gardens and other private outdoor spaces, instead of just in public spaces, as Johnson said “there is no difference in the health risk”.The prime minister said people should try to avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession, “so that we can avoid the risk of quick transmission from lots of different families and continue to control the virus”.The new rules apply to the over-70s but those considered extremely clinically vulnerable to the virus are still being asked to shield by staying at home.In Scotland, people from one household will be able to meet with another household outdoors in public spaces or a private garden from Friday, providing they maintain physical distancing. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the maximum number of people in a group should be eight.The approach in Wales is similar. People in a household will be able to meet with one other household outdoors from Monday. In Northern Ireland, groups of six are already allowed to meet outdoors. The Stormont executive plans to confirm the further easing of lockdown regulations after a meeting on 4 June but it is expected to allow small outdoor wedding ceremonies, attended by no more than 10 people.Yes. “You can even have a barbecue providing you do it in a socially distanced way, provided everybody washes their hands, provided everybody exercises common sense,” said the prime minister. . The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, added that those having a barbecue should remember they can spread the virus by passing things from one person to another.Yes and no. The UK government has said the science makes it clear the chances of spreading coronavirus is much smaller outside so socialising inside is not allowed.However, the prime minister said people could go through houses to access back gardens. Whitty also confirmed it was acceptable for people to use their host’s toilet, as long as they washed their hands thoroughly and wiped down surfaces afterwards.The Welsh government has also said it is OK for people to walk through someone’s home to get to their garden but they would be publishing guidance on how to do this safely.While people in England can travel as far as they want to take exercise and spend time outside, they cannot stay over at people’s houses. “We don’t want people to go to other households and stay there. I’m afraid we are not at that stage,” said Johnson.In Wales people are being asked to stay local, which is defined as about 8km (five miles) from their homes. Sturgeon said there would be no legal limit on how far people in Scotland could travel but she said the strong advice was to stay within five miles.Yes. Outdoor retail such as markets and car showrooms in England will be allowed to open in England from Monday. Other non-essential shops can open a fortnight later, as long as they abide by the guidelines.In Scotland, garden centres and plant nurseries will be able to open from Friday. The Welsh government will decide whether non-essential retail will reopen at their next lockdown review on 18 June, though they said such businesses, which could comply with the physical distancing duty, should prepare to reopen.The UK government confirmed it was pushing ahead with plans to open primary schools in England to some pupils from Monday, giving headteachers three days of half-term\u0026nbspholiday to make final preparations. Nurseries and childcare providers in England are also being told they can reopen from 1 June. However, some local authorities have insisted schools in their area will not be opening.In Scotland, teachers can return to schools from Monday to prepare for\u0026nbspthe start of the new school year on 11 August, when pupils will do a mixture of at-home and in-school learning. The governments in Wales and Northern Ireland have said schools will not reopen on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a7cba46c8986d632b92ee75d7af9b9d488df9ec/0_348_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67a04500f2ae312be6bfab6be5a9e21f","title":"are you reuniting with family or friends as lockdown eases","story":"As lockdown restrictions ease, we’d like to hear about your reunionsAre you reuniting with family or friends, if so, we’d like to hear from you.

Johnson’s top aide has been embroiled in a scandal after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had coronavirus symptoms.Romania’s prime minister, Ludovic Orban, paid a 3,000 lei fine ($687£556) on Saturday for breaking his own coronavirus restrictions by not wearing a face mask and smoking indoors.

EASA regularly updates a list of airports located in affected areas with high risk of coronavirus transmission, which include 13 in the UK, all airports in 22 US states, and those in the Ile de France region surrounding Paris.Frontline workers in Mexico City’s hospitals are planning a national march on Monday to demand appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Nurses and other health workers account for about a quarter of all of Mexico’s coronavirus infections, government data shows, one of the highest rates in the world.The country’s detected coronavirus infections now exceed 30,000, the health minister, Zweli Mkhize, said on Saturday. South Africa reported 1,727 new cases, taking the cumulative total to 30,967. Its death toll increased by 32 to 643.Pakistan has reported 78 coronavirus deaths on Saturday, a single day record since the pandemic arrived in the country in March.

It has reported more than 26,600 coronavirus cases and 853 deaths.The New York state governor, Andrew Cuomo, signed a bill on Saturday that will grant death benefits to the families of police officers, public health workers and other frontline workers who have died of the coronavirus. “You gave your lives for us, we will be there for your families going forward,” Cuomo said as he signed the legislation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87b03ad8d6e1d94a678fefbf789215bd391f359/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53dea7b8df1298430a0f7c199df3d2a6","title":"could nearly half of those with covid 19 have no idea they are infected","story":"As studies confirm many infected people show no symptoms, contact tracing and face masks assume even greater importance When Noopur Raje’s husband fell critically ill with Covid-19 in mid-March, she did not suspect that she too was infected with the virus.Raje, an oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, had been caring for her sick husband for a week before driving him to an emergency centre with a persistently high fever. But after she herself had a diagnostic PCR test – which looks for traces of the Sars-CoV-2 virus DNA in saliva – she was astounded to find that the result was positive.“My husband ended up very sick,” she says. “He was in intensive care for a day, and in hospital for 10 days. But while I was also infected, I had no symptoms at all. I have no idea why we responded so differently.”It took two months for Raje’s husband to recover. Repeated tests, done every five days, showed that Raje remained infected for the same length of time, all while remaining completely asymptomatic. In some ways it is unsurprising that the virus persisted in her body for so long, given that it appears her body did not even mount a detectable immune response against the infection.When they both took an antibody test earlier this month, Raje’s husband showed a high level of antibodies to the virus, while Raje appeared to have no response at all, something she found hard to comprehend.“It’s mind-blowing,” she says. “Some people are able to be colonised with the virus and not be symptomatic, while others end up with pretty severe illness. I think it’s something to do with differences in immune regulation, but we still haven’t figured out exactly how this is happening.”Epidemiological studies are now revealing that the number of iniduals who carry and can pass on the infection, yet remain completely asymptomatic, is larger than originally thought. Scientists believe these people have contributed to the spread of the virus in care homes, and they are central in the debate regarding face mask policies, as health officials attempt to avoid new waves of infections while societies reopen.But the realisation that asymptomatic people can spread an infection is not completely surprising. For starters, there is the famous early 20th century case of “Typhoid Mary”, a cook who infected 53 people in various households in the US with typhoid fever despite displaying no symptoms herself. In fact, all bacterial, viral and parasitic infections – ranging from malaria to HIV – have a certain proportion of asymptomatic carriers. Research has even shown that at any one time, all of us are infected with between eight and 12 viruses, without showing any symptoms.From the microbe’s perspective, this makes perfect evolutionary sense. “For any virus or bacteria, making people infectious but not ill is an excellent way to spread and persist in populations,” says Rein Houben, an infectious diseases researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine.“I warned on 24 January to consider asymptomatic cases as a transmission vehicle for Covid-19, but this was ignored at the time,” says Bill Keevil, professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton. “Since then, many countries have reported asymptomatic cases, never showing obvious symptoms, but shedding virus.”The first identified case of asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 occurred in early January, when a traveller from Wuhan passed on the virus to five family members in different parts of the city of Anyang. After testing positive, she then remained asymptomatic for the entire 21-day follow-up period.While scientists still don’t know whether asymptomatic people are as contagious as those who display symptoms, there are still many ways in which they can pass on Covid-19. “We know that you don’t need to be coughing to transmit a respiratory infection like Sars-CoV-2,” says Houben. “Talking, singing, even blowing instruments like a vuvuzela – in the past all of those have been shown to transmit respiratory viruses in some way.”Houben points out that, because most asymptomatic people have no idea they are infected, they are unlikely to be self-isolating, and studies have shown this has contributed to the rampant spread of the virus in facilities such as homeless shelters and care homes. He says this means there is a need for regular diagnostic testing of almost all people in such closed environments, including prisons and psychiatric facilities.“When it comes to controlling Covid-19, this really shows that we cannot rely on self-isolation of symptomatic cases only,” he says. “Going forwards we need trace and test approaches to account for iniduals who are not reporting any symptoms.”Since February, the country that has arguably had the greatest success in suppressing asymptomatic spread of Covid-19 is South Korea. Armed with a rigorous contact tracing and diagnostic testing regime, which involved dozens of drive-through testing centres across major cities enabling tests to be carried out at a rate of one every 10 minutes, they put specific policies in place to offset the threat of asymptomatic carriers from the moment the virus began to spread out of control in Daegu.“Once identified, all asymptomatic people are asked to self quarantine in their house until they test negative, with health service officials checking on them twice daily, and monitoring their symptoms,” says Eunha Shim, an epidemiologist at Soongsil University in Seoul.As Korea attempts to prevent a second wave of infections while reopening schools and allowing people to return to offices, preventing asymptomatic spread is one of their main priorities. This is being done by a mass public health campaign advocating the wearing of masks at all times outside the home. In Seoul, it is not possible to access the subway without a mask.Many scientists are increasingly calling for this policy to be officially introduced in the UK, especially as more and more people resume commuting in the coming months. Keevil says: “There is a strong case to be made for the public wearing appropriate face covers in confined areas such as stations, trains, metro carriages and buses, where it is extremely difficult to maintain the two-metre gap, considered essential to allow respiratory droplets from infected people to fall down before making contact with other people.“The argument is that face covers may not protect the wearer, but might significantly reduce transmission of virus particles to adjacent people in the closed environment. If there is any benefit to be gained, then everyone should wear a mask, which is why some countries are fining people who do not wear a mask and preventing them travelling.”Some have argued that masks may pose a risk of harm to the wearer because of their potential to become an infectious surface, but Keevil says this can be avoided through proper cleaning.“There would need to be policies such as, when arriving at work, place the mask immediately in a plastic bag and wash your hands,” he says. “And then, when returning home, carefully take off the mask and place it immediately in a washing machine for a 60C wash and wash your hands.”For Raje, understanding why asymptomatic patients like her respond the way they do to the virus, will have some critical implications for all of us over the coming months, for example in determining whether vaccines turn out to be effective.“The big question I have after my experience, is whether a vaccine will really work in all people,” she says. “The vaccination approach is to create an immune response, which then protects you. But if asymptomatic people are not producing a normal antibody response to the virus, what does that mean? Because it’s these people who are the vectors and the carriers of this virus, I think we can’t get away from social distancing until we have some of these answers out there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19f0da24fecd78a0be87901869f10dc9d5b66f4/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=205b3ca73db41db68bd75ec01122c2cc","title":"dominic cummings jonathan van tam lockdown rules apply to all","story":"England’s deputy chief medical officer says country is at ‘very dangerous moment’ as restrictions easeEngland’s deputy chief medical officer has said that the lockdown rules “are clear and they have always been clear”, in the strongest condemnation yet by a senior health official of Dominic Cummings’ lockdown breach.It comes as the government’s own science advisers broke cover over its decision to ease lockdown measures, with a growing number expressing concerns about plans for\u0026nbspEngland\u0026nbspfrom Monday.As people flocked to beaches and beauty spots and temperatures soared over the weekend, Jonathan Van-Tam warned at the daily press briefing on Saturday that the country was at a “very dangerous moment” describing coronavirus as “a coiled spring ready to get out if we don’t stay on top of it”.Van-Tam urged the public not to “tear the pants” out of government guidance, saying the country would have to move slowly out of the lockdown as fears grow that the warm weather and easing of restrictions could lead to a decline in compliance.He urged the public to adhere to the latest guidelines, saying the virus could infect many more people, and warning that with the current R rate between 0.7 and 0.9 the country had to move slowly.During the conference Van-Tam was asked to comment on the controversy surrounding Cummings, the government’s senior political aide, and whether he had breached the rules of the lockdown by travelling to see his family during the height of the pandemic in the UK. While the chief scientific officer, Patrick Vallance, said on Thursday that he did “not want to get involved in politics”, Van-Tam said he was “quite happy” to answer the question.“In my opinion the rules are clear and they have always been clear,” he said. “In my opinion they are for the benefit of all. In my opinion they apply to all.”Earlier in the day one of the government’s scientific advisers warned that the Cummings affair has eroded trust in its authority, while a growing number of other government advisers voiced unease over the decision to lift England’s lockdown, warning that loosening restrictions could easily lead to a second wave.Prof Robert West, a member of the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviours (SPI-B) that advises Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies), said the decision by Cummings to travel from London to Durham during the full lockdown would have an impact on people adhering to the latest rules.The UCL scientist said: “Trust in authority telling you to do things is very important when it comes to people adhering to those rules. When people see something like the Cummings affair … that’s not a recipe for trust.”R, or the \u0027effective reproduction number\u0027, is a way of rating a disease’s ability to spread. It’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out – eventually.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus people\u0027s behaviour, such as social distancing\u0026nbspand a population’s immunity. A country may see regional variations in its R number, depending on local factors like population density and transport patterns.It came as the culture secretary Oliver Dowden announced that football, tennis, horseracing, Formula One, cricket, golf, rugby and snooker would start up again. Groups of up to six people from different households will be able to exercise together from Monday, while maintaining a distance of 2 metres, he said.Billed as the recovery of British sport, the move will allow teams to play together and take part in conditioning and fitness sessions which do not involve physical contact.“Today I am also glad to confirm that we are relaxing the rules on exercise further so that from Monday people will be able to exercise with up to five others from different households, crucially, so long as they remain two metres apart,” he said. “The British sporting recovery has begun.”Dowden added that the government has published guidance to allow elite sport to resume behind closed doors, with guidelines on how to get athletes back into socially distanced training and then back into close-contact training.Boris Johnson has announced a gradual easing of the lockdown in England from Monday, when friends and relatives will be able to meet in parks and gardens in socially distanced groups of six.“Happy Monday” will also signal the reopening of schools – allowing children in nurseries, early-years settings, reception, year 1 and year 6 to return to class – as well as more shops, with outdoor retail and car showrooms able to resume operations.Van-Tam agreed that it was a “dangerous moment” and that scientists were right to urge caution but he added that scientific opinions always vary to some extent “across the piste”.He went on to urge the public to continue to comply with the guidance saying that otherwise the virus could get out of control.“So I really hope that people will follow the advice that’s given to the letter, and not any further than that, to make sure we’re never in that position again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ef2b84fe0225beb98c0a8e661958510b32323f4/0_11_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=49d7d6ed65c4af5a120f48a515bbba4b","title":"lockdown to be eased for englands most clinically vulnerable","story":"New Covid-19 guidelines to allow 2.2 million who are shielding to go outside from MondayThe more than 2 million people who have been “shielding” from Covid-19 in England because they are deemed to be clinically extremely vulnerable will be allowed to spend time outdoors from Monday for the first time in 10 weeks.Boris Johnson praised their resilience as their particular lockdown measures are set to be eased. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, will confirm the move on Sunday.The 2.2 million clinically extremely vulnerable people will be able to go outside with members of their household from Monday, while continuing to follow physical distancing guidelines. Those who live alone can meet outside with one other person from another household.Reviews of the shielding guidance are expected to be made at regular points in the coming weeks.Johnson said: “I want to thank everyone who has followed the shielding guidance – it is because of your patience and sacrifice that thousands of lives have been saved. I do not underestimate just how difficult it has been for you, staying at home for the last 10 weeks, and I want to pay tribute to your resilience.“I also want to recognise the hundreds of thousands of extraordinary volunteers who have supported you in shielding.”Jenrick said: “Those shielding from coronavirus have made huge sacrifices over recent months to protect both themselves and the NHS – they deserve our thanks and our support for their efforts.“Incidence rates of coronavirus are now significantly lower than before these measures were put in place.“That’s why we are focused on finding the right balance between continuing to protect those at the greatest clinical risk, whilst easing restrictions on their daily lives to make the difficult situation more bearable – particularly enabling the contact with loved ones they and we all seek.”Steven McIntosh, director of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, called the move a “step forward for people who are most vulnerable to coronavirus, a group who have felt left behind and forgotten as lockdown eases”.But he added: “The government also hasn’t yet delivered its commitment to provide greater help to this extremely vulnerable group, and Macmillan has heard from people living with cancer that existing ‘shielding’ support isn’t getting through.“So the government must now set out how they will guarantee the needs of the most vulnerable and isolated are met.”And Phil Anderson, head of policy at the MS Society, said people would want to hear the scientific evidence behind the decision.He said: “Over 130,000 people live with MS in the UK and thousands of them have been left feeling forgotten after months of shielding. While for some it may be a relief that this relaxation is happening in England others have been left feeling confused.“We’re extremely concerned this news has come out of the blue – people who are extremely vulnerable will rightly want to hear a lot more about the scientific evidence showing this will be safe for them.“If the government is serious about supporting vulnerable people who are shielding they need more than just the ability to go outside. Crucially, we want to see better mental health support for everyone who needs it.”Those shielding remain at risk, however, and the government said they should only leave the house once a day, should not go to work or the shops, and should avoid crowded places where they cannot physically distance.Support provided to those with serious medical complications, such as the delivery of food, medicines and phone calls, will continue.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71db4bb47ce8f9cdf70f091e200419936a104791/0_118_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=590762b831316cf222c2d69a00fc000b","title":"cook off the no budget romcom that became the first zimbabwean film on netflix","story":"Shot in the chaotic last days of Robert Mugabe’s regime, Cook Off is a feel-good tale of resilience and hopeA Zimbabwean film about a woman who enters a TV cooking show and which cost only $8,000 to make has become the first feature from the country to make it onto Netflix.“Seeing myself on Netflix, I have to punch myself every day. Like, is that really me?” asked actress Tendaiishe Chitima, star of Cook Off, which has now been acquired by the streaming giant.Cook Off was shot in 2017, just months before the fall of Zimbabwe’s despotic ex-president Robert Mugabe, whose iron-fisted rule brought the economy to its knees. The romantic comedy had a meagre starting budget of just $8,000.“It was not like a luxury shoot where you have your own trailer and you are big on wine,” said 29-year-old Chitima, sparkly eyed as she recalled the experience from her parent’s house in Johannesburg, South Africa.“Everything was very minimalistic. We had to get things right the first time or the second time.”Chitima plays main character Anesu, a single mother too busy making ends meet to pursue her passion for food ... until her son and grandmother sign her up for a reality cooking contest.For the Zimbabwean debutante, making it onto Netflix was a “miracle” given the filming conditions.Most of Cook Off was shot on the set of Zimbabwe’s version of Top Chef, which airs on public broadcaster ZBC.“We used the costumes, the set, the cooking pots of Battle of the Chefs,” said director Tomas Brickhill, referring to a programme now no longer airing. “Without that there would not have been any movie.”Chitima admitted that none of the cast or crew had yet been paid for their work. Their budget barely covered food for the crew while on set.“At the time there was restriction on (cash) withdrawals,” Brickhill recalled.“Every day we had to source cash,” he said in an interview with AFP, adding that hard to get hold of notes were selling for more than their value on the black market.The daily limit was $20 – not even enough for bottled water in a country crippled by hyperinflation.“Other people think we are completely crazy,” he chuckled. “But we have been dealing with it for so long, that is normal for us.”With no running water on set and little cash to spare, the Cook Off crew resorted to drinking boiled water from a garden tap.The first days of shooting were also constantly disrupted by power cuts – a regular occurrence – forcing the team to stretch their paltry budget and hire a generator.One day, one of the actresses found herself choked up in a cloud of tear gas fired to disperse an anti-government protest.“She called and said: ‘I can still come but I am crying and I don’t know if I am going to be able to act because I don’t have a crying scene’,” said Brickhill.Despite the challenges, Cook Off did not lose its sparkle and “feel good” effect.“Previously I was acting in a lot of TV shows in which my role as a Zimbabwean was either a maid, a prostitute, or I was being trafficked,” said Chitima, who had previously featured only in shorter productions.“A role in which I could play an empowered character pursing what she wanted was for me a great opportunity. The movie shows the other side of our story. That we are resilient and have dreams.”Chitima hoped to eventually star in big budget productions.Meanwhile, the crew and the cast are still awaiting their cheques, after agreeing to deferred payments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89f413c17355564adf930e83a0e15fc48f360caf/0_105_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89be84ba74e65acf277b3e54f187b8cf","title":"jacinda ardern political leaders can be both empathetic and strong","story":"In this book extract, the New Zealand PM says too much focus on power and strength means leaders can lose sight of the need for kindnessTell us a little about yourself.My name is Jacinda Ardern and I’m the prime minister of New Zealand. And I’m the third female prime minister, the second youngest, and the youngest female prime minister.You were 17 when you joined the Labour party in New Zealand?Yes, I joined a political party when I was a teenager and for me it wasn’t because I thought a life in politics was for me. Absolutely no! In fact, if anything, I thought it looked like a very hard life. It was because I was one of those young people that thought I’d like to change the world, even if it was in the smallest of ways, it just felt like I was doing something that would make a difference. At 17 did you imagine ever that you would become prime minister?Until the day before I became prime minister I couldn’t have imagined becoming prime minister! And in part that’s because I’m a New Zealander and we are naturally quite a self-deprecating people, and part, if I’m honest, it’s probably because I’m also a woman who looks more quickly at my deficits the things that I’m not good at, rather than what I am. But either way, I never would have imagined as a child that I would end up doing a role like this, because I grew up in a very small town, and there are 120 MPs (members of parliament) in New Zealand. How could I possibly imagine being one of them?You’ve become an internationally famous person, a role model for many around the world, but it was just over three years ago that the then leader of the Labour party called you into his office and said, “I don’t think I can get there,” and said that he wanted to place his trust in you. I remember that first press conference.… So do I!… the impact you made, and the authority and confidence you brought to that moment. I think many people around New Zealand felt that perhaps you didn’t have enough experience, or that you were too young. What gave you the confidence to suddenly step forward?You’ve talked about that moment in terms of trusting your instincts. Was that something you trusted before you got into this?Yes. I don’t know what I would do in this role or in politics without having instincts that I trust. Now that doesn’t mean that I choose to ignore evidence and research – that’s very, very important to me, to make evidence-informed decisions – but actually you just can’t ignore what your instincts are telling you nor should you. I think one of the dangers of leadership now, and particularly in politics, is that we have so much information now, and so much research around the way that people think, and the way they process what they hear, and how we’re meant to present ourselves, that you run the risk of becoming over-engineered. And I think, if there’s anything that people need right now, is they just need to see human beings doing their best as leaders. And that means that from time to time you’ll stumble, and you should be honest about that it means that people will see your failings and we should be honest about that too. People need authenticity, not, I think, some manufactured idea of what political leadership is meant to be. If you were to summarise the qualities that have underpinned your path to this leadership role, what do you think has been most important for you?Kindness, and not being afraid to be kind, or to focus on, or be really driven by empathy. I think one of the sad things that I’ve seen in political leadership is – because we’ve placed over time so much emphasis on notions of assertiveness and strength – that we probably have assumed that it means you can’t have those other qualities of kindness and empathy. And yet, when you think about all the big challenges that we face in the world, that’s probably the quality we need the most. We need our leaders to be able to empathise with the circumstances of others to empathise with the next generation that we’re making decisions on behalf of. And if we focus only on being seen to be the strongest, most powerful person in the room, then I think we lose what we’re meant to be here for. So I’m proudly focused on empathy, because you can be both empathetic and strong.What are the biggest lessons you’ve learned as a leader?That you won’t necessarily get tougher. When I first came into politics I remember talking to a member of parliament who I thought was quite a tough cookie, and asking him, “How did you, how do you, build your thick skin?”. He was horrified that I thought that he was like that! He said stuff still got to him, and that actually if stuff ever stopped getting to you then you’d probably lost your empathy, and it was never worth losing that. And so, I actually decided I didn’t necessarily want to build some tough exterior. Instead I just learned how to filter things how to kind of take on board that criticism and listen to it when I needed to, or otherwise say, “Well, actually that person’s just coming from a very different perspective”, and just learn how to filter it. And so that was a really big learning curve, you know? Actually, the world doesn’t need a whole lot of massively thickskinned politicians they do need people who care. The odd sensitive flower is OK.Can you describe a key moment or crisis that has particularly tested you as a leader?Tell us a little about your process and feelings around that time. How did you work out how you, as a leader, were supposed to react? What you could do?You know, I don’t ever remember thinking about how I was meant to react or what it was I was meant to be. The only thing I did remember thinking, was that I knew I couldn’t show every emotion that I was feeling that wasn’t what everyone needed. They really just wanted to hear what everyone else was thinking.I’ve always said I felt like all I did at that time was just reflect back what I was seeing, and amongst this horrific human tragedy I just saw this outpouring of grief and love for a community who gave that all back in return. And that was one of the things I think to this day remains the most staggering for me in all of this, that not even 24 hours after the shooting I went to Christchurch and sat face to face with some of the people who, the day before, were in the media covered in blood having been right there where this massacre occurred, and as they stood up I just couldn’t imagine what they were going to say. I thought it might be anger, but they stood and said, “Thank you”. They thanked New Zealanders. Twenty-four hours later they were thanking us for our response to the community, and that was both devastating and also had me in awe that a community could be so forgiving.And so really, from there, that just said to me, “Well, who are we to display anything other than love and kindness under those circumstances”, and that’s what New Zealand did.This is an edited extract from I know this to be true: Jacinda Ardern, interview and photography by Geoff Blackwell, Murdoch Books RRP $17.99"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Unthinkable: Conceivable Future is fostering a personal but \u0026lsquodeeply political\u0026rsquo debateRite\u0026ampReason: A healthy planet is a prerequisite for a healthy humanityProtecting wildlife: Local says this is the third year in a row hedgerows cut at wrong time"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258341.1589987604!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"conquering everest on a mayo ridge for a good cause","story":"Day after day as May began, the sun rose from the ridge in one of our kitchen windows and started to set, around nine, in another, behind the slope to the sea. At that point, low in the clear air, it was just too blinding to look at.For Cathy McGrail, who lives a couple of kilometres north along the road, the stunning weather was a blessing on her great idea. If you’re going to climb the ridge 34 times, to equal the height of Everest, it helps if the cosmos is with you.Cathy is a friend, a busy, buoyant woman who takes badly to doing nothing. When lockdown came, she lost her daily work with special needs children at the Sunbeam centre in the local school.Community effort thrives in the small-farm west. She decided to raise money for Sunbeam classroom equipment and for Meals on Wheels as well. Held within two kilometres and looking up at the steep slope above the road, she thought “doing an Everest” might work.Killadoon Hill, where the ridge curves inland, is 267 metres high, so that, by rough count, Cathy needed 34 climbs to match the 8,84 metres of Everest. The last of them comes tomorrow, when she could lead a suitably spaced line of supporters, along with a friend who has been her “Sherpa” from the start.This is what happened on the climb to back the national Darkness Into Light appeal. Pictures on Cathy’s website (gofundme: Cathy does Everest) show a magical, crystal-clear night with a full, white moon above the ocean and another with the group in silhouettes spaced out against the dawn. By climb 19, through familiar drizzly mist, the amazing views were lost, but Cathy’s target of €1,000 was already multiplied five times over. Meanwhile, at our stretch of the ridge at Thallabawn, I look up past the sheep and the mountain fence, to heights I shall never reach again. A pity, I suppose, yet I once dismissed the ridge as a great bare lump of a hill. “Unless you have sheep,” I wrote, “ you have no business going up there.”My first ascents, in new and eager exploration, followed the stream, up through the rushes, around the rocky footprints of pre-Famine bothies and over the crotch-skimming barbs of the mountain fence. The view from the ridge was rewarding, with a gleam of Croagh Patrick in the north, and the ramparts of the Sheefrys in the south. A millionaire with a Mayo mansion used to land his helicopter there, on his way to Connemara to buy scallops. He would climb out and stand for a while, for the huge sea view and a pee.These were also my rewards when, in training for Greenland, I went up before breakfast bearing a rucksack full of rope. Perhaps it was then, too, coming down sodden from rain and wind, that I made my disparaging remarks.Puzzling structureThe ridge curves south and broadens into a plateau where hollows still carry the old, dark scars of turf-cutting, But at the highest point of all, Cathy came upon a puzzling structure: a stubby concrete column with a tarnished metal plate on the the top.Í had never seen it, but could explain it as a “trig pillar” used in the triangulation of Ireland, the geometrical, trigonometrical grid by which the island was mapped, first by the British, then by the Irish Ordnance Survey. Old maps have been my love, among them our fistful of slim, red-jacketed editions from 1909. They fold out on stiff linen, each a small rectangle of the west mapped at one inch to the mile. Their hachuring – meticulous, hand-penned shading – shaped mountains long before contour lines.It embellishes cartography that grew from men hauling heavy theodolites in boxes across bogs and up the highest peaks. Their vital measurements were made by squinting at night, in cool, clear air, for a pinpoint of limelight on another summit, perhaps 70 miles or more away.In Britain, its birthplace, the Ordnance Survey served military, strategic needs in Ireland, those of taxing 60,000 townlands. In a “retriangulation” from 1959 by the Irish Ordnance Survey, heights were progressively studded with concrete pillars, each moulded with wooden shuttering and crowned with its spider of brass as a firm base for a theodolite. Cathy’s is at Corrymailley, named for a townland of O’Malleys.

Denis tackled one of them and I thought ‘I will have to tackle this fella as well.’ I tried to grab the hammer. It was a total blur. “They totally backed down. I remember Denis just shouting: ‘Ye are cowards. Ye are total cowards. Denis is a total hero. When I saw him taking one of them on, he totally inspired me. He is very fit.”Mr Murphy said friendship was at the root of the actions of Mr O’Connor. “I know him so well he came to my aid. He wasn’t looking after the bookies, he was looking after me. I could never thank him enough.”A native of Kiskeam in North Cork, Mr O’Connor told The Irish Sun: “I just didn’t think about what I was doing. Sometimes you can just sit down and do nothing or you can stand up to people like these and that’s what I did.”Gardaí have renewed their appeal on Saturday for witnesses to the incident. The two men are currently detained at at Mayfield Garda Station under Section 30 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 which allows gardaí hold suspects for up to three days before they have to be charged or released.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Bejing approved decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorismMove paves way for anti-sedition laws which rights advocates say will threaten city\u0026rsquos freedomsAt least 69 cases this week linked to cluster of infections at logistics facilityThousands take to streets to oppose Beijing-backed laws curtailing city\u0026rsquos freedomsMove to impose security law illustrates Beijing\u0026rsquos increasing tendency to flex its muscleProtesters get ready for more demonstrations against proposed Beijing lawsCommissioner in territory says contentious new security law aimed at \u0026lsquotroublemakers\u0026rsquoPM has made most of her communication skills and the country\u0026rsquos political cultureCian English (19), from Carlow, died following fall from Gold Coast apartmentChina proposes path to imposing rules used against dissidents on the mainlandPolice fire tear gas in popular shopping district as protesters take to the streets\u0026lsquoThere is a political virus spreading in United States,\u0026rsquo says China\u0026rsquos foreign ministerWinds gusting up to 210kmh expected near iron ore producing heartland of the PilbaraInvestigation begins into cause of Pakistan International Airlines crash that killed 97Officials confirm two survivors after PIA aircraft crashes in residential area of KarachiOutrage among pro-democracy legislators at security law put forward at National People\u0026rsquos CongressRescue teams hampered by torn-down power lines and flooding over large tracts of landPro-Beijing politicians are pushing contentious laws in the face of intense oppositionCyclone Amphan moving inland with gusts of up to 185kmh, says India met serviceSuper cyclone Amphan, with winds up to 160kmh, expected to hit India\u0026rsquos coast on WednesdayStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Tension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayAccident in which 15 wounded takes place during training exercise in Gulf of OmanFormation of coalition to proceed after supreme court clears way for PM to remain in officePolitics and ision facilitate virus in country with just 208 ventilators and scant testingPresident fears country\u0026rsquos 44 cases and three deaths could \u0026lsquosuddenly spike in few days or weeks\u0026rsquoResidents in Mosul, still traumatised by violence, fear a resurgence of the terror groupStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4266832.1590867416!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"spacex and nasa successfully launch astronauts into orbit","story":"The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the first spaceflight of Nasa astronauts from US soil in nine years.

Photograph: Nasa TVAFP via GettySpaceX, the private space exploration company of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, launched two Americans toward orbit from Florida in a mission that marks the first spaceflight of Nasa astronauts from US soil in nine years.A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center at 8.22pm Irish time on Saturday, launching Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken on a 19-hour journey on the company’s newly designed Crew Dragon capsule bound for the International Space Station.The first launch attempt on Wednesday was called off with less than 17 minutes remaining on the countdown clock due to stormy weather around the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral.The launch pad was the same one used by Nasa’s final space shuttle flight, piloted by Mr Hurley, in 2011. Since then, Nasa astronauts have used Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft to go into orbit.For Mr Musk, the launch represents another milestone for the reusable rockets his company pioneered to make spaceflight less costly and frequent. And it marks the first time that commercially developed space vehicles – owned and operated by a private entity rather than Nasa – have carried Americans into orbit.The last time Nasa launched astronauts into space on a new vehicle was 40 years ago at the start of the shuttle programme.Trump visitUS president Donald Trump and vice-president Mike Pence visited the Kennedy Space Center three days ago for the first launch attempt.Mr Trump and Mr Pence returned for the second attempt and watched from a rooftop along with officials and Republican politicians. The president described the event as an inspiration for our country and a beautiful sight.I\u0027m so proud of the people at Nasa, all the people that worked together, public and private, he told reporters.Mr Musk, the South African-born high-tech entrepreneur who made his fortune in Silicon Valley, is also the chief executive of electric carmaker and battery manufacturer Tesla. He founded California-based SpaceX, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies, in 2002.Mr Hurley (53) and Mr Behnken (49), Nasa employees under contract to fly with SpaceX, are expected to remain at the space station for several weeks, assisting a short-handed crew aboard the orbital laboratory.Boeing, producing its own launch system in competition with SpaceX, is expected to fly its CST-100 Starliner vehicle with astronauts aboard for the first time next year.

They have also warned that Beijing may be using Huawei and UK universities to advance China’s defence programme.Tom Tugendhat, Conservative MP and chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said: “This investigation points to another worrying front in a soft war that China has been waging against us. We need to defend ourselves.”“The UK cannot be an unwitting partner with a regime that does not share our values and works against our interests.”Huawei has strongly disputed analysis of the papers by academics with specialisms in military technology and artificial intelligence. It said that it is a private company, and that the papers identified by the  focused on “common areas of research for telecoms equipment suppliers” It also has “strict rules” in place specifying that the research and development it funds at universities is for civilian use, a spokesman said. “We do not conduct military research either directly, or indirectly, nor do we work on military or intelligence projects for the Chinese government or any other government”.However,  experts have raised concerns over the potential for Beijing to influence Huawei\u0027s research funding decisions to enhance the Chinese Communist Party’s “military-civil fusion” policy.The policy was written into the constitution in 2017, on the order of by President Xi Jinping, and demands that all new technologies developed by China’s civilian sector – including technology companies and universities - are made available to the military.Tory grandee Iain Duncan Smith said: “China’s target is that in 2049 they are militarily more powerful than any other nation in the world.

I don’t think many of them will choose to walk out.”Another former BBC News executive, Richard Sambrook, has been hired by the corporation to review social media use by staff and official programme accounts. The BBC insisted that the review was commissioned before the Maitlis controversy.Mr Damazer said it would be wrong to ban BBC staff from using Twitter, as it is now a source of breaking news. And he said more lenient rules apply for non-news presenters who voice controversial opinions on social media, such as Gary Lineker and Chris Packham.Ms Maitlis was publicly reprimanded for an extraordinary monologue on Tuesday’s edition of Newsnight. In it, she stated as fact that Mr Cummings had broken lockdown rules, and said the British public had been left feeling like fools.Some of Ms Maitlis’s supporters have claimed that Newsnight is a magazine programme and therefore not subject to stringent impartiality rules.But Mr Damazer, who left the BBC in 2010 to become Master of St Peter’s College, Oxford, said: “The programme is a current affairs programme rather than a straight news programme, but it sits absolutely four square in the middle of the BBC’s obligations to impartiality.“I think Emily is extremely good. But I’m in no doubt that turning the opening of a programme into something that looked like an opinion column is not a way of convincing an audience, even an audience as sophisticated as Newsnight’s, that it is going to be a dispassionate and fair-minded look at the issue of the day.”Other BBC employees who have been accused of bias before include News at Ten presenter Huw Edwards and Gary Lineker, who presents Match of the Day.Mr Edwards faced criticism after liking a tweet saying “Vote Labour for the National Health Service in the build up to the 2019 General Election.  Mr Edwards responded with a Tweet saying it wasn\u0027t an offence to back the NHS : Yeah I liked a tweet which seemed to be a celebration of our wonderful @nhs —apologies for not watching right to the end. But apologise for supporting the NHS? Never.  Meanwhile, Mr Lineker has become well known for his anti-Brexit stance from his Twitter posts, with one saying Britain had won the Golden Dumbass award.The BBC said that as Mr Lineker is not involved in any news or political output, any expression of his personal political views does not affect the broadcaster\u0027s impartiality.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"belgian prince tests positive covid attending high society party","story":"A Belgian man who tested positive after attending a party in Spain is the country’s Prince Joachim, it emerged on Saturday.The 28-year-old, tenth in line to the Belgian throne, attended a party in the southern Spanish city of Cordoba which is now being investigated by authorities there.He is the younger son and third child of Prince Lorenz and Princess Astrid and therefore the nephew of the current Belgian monarch King Philippe.Prince Joachim has lived in Spain for several years with his girlfriend Victoria Ortiz Martinez-Sagrera.The party where he contracted coronavirus was reportedly organised in his honour a day after he returned to Spain on Monday following two months in Belgium.The event was held in a private house amid conflicting local reports up to 30 high-society people may have attended the bash in breach of strict conditions linked to Spain’s coronavirus lockdown.Police in Cordoba are said to have launched an investigation to determine whether anyone should face fines.Before Spanish press echoed the name of the mystery man who had caught coraonvirus at the party, regional Junta de Andalucia governors had already reported the incident to police and central government representative in the area.Only a maximum of 15 people were allowed to attend the party under rules in place at the time.No-one has yet officially confirmed how many attended the bash.Prince Joachim is said to flown to Madrid from Belgium on March 24 before taking a high-speed AVE train to Cordoba.The Belgian royal palace confirmed the details in a statement to a Belgian newspaper.Meanwhile a plane flying from Madrid to Lanzarote was quarantined by officials and an investigation launched after a man on board found out he had tested positive for coronavirus whilst in the air.On landing, the aircraft, along with the 140 passengers on board, was cordoned off by Spanish health and safety authorities at Cesar Manrique airport on the popular holiday island.Police are investigating why the man was travelling and whether he has breached quarantine rules. He reportedly took a test for the virus before he travelled because he had been in contact with someone who had died from Covid-19, however he departed Madrid before the results arrived. He now faces prosecution.The man and the passengers sitting close to him on the plane were immediately isolated on landing and face two weeks in quarantine, while the rest of the flight were allowed to disembark, taken to quarantine in a local hotel together for a week and tested to see if they have caught the virus while on the flight.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus norway wonders should have like sweden","story":"On Wednesday night, Norway\u0027s prime minister Erna Solberg went on Norwegian television to make a startling admission: she had panicked. Some, even most, of the tough measures imposed in Norway\u0027s lockdown now looked like steps too far. Was it necessary to close schools? she mused. Perhaps not.It was a preemptive step only a leader with Solberg\u0027s folksy, down-to-earth style could get away with. I probably took many of the decisions out of fear, she admitted, reminding viewers of the terrifying images then flooding their screens from Italy.She is not the first in Norway to conclude that closing schools and kindergartens, making everyone work from home, or limiting gatherings to a maximum of five people might have been excessive.As far back as May 5, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) published a briefing note reporting that at the time the lockdown was imposed on March 12, Norway\u0027s reproduction number - the number of people each infected person on average infects - had already fallen to 1.1. It slipped under 1 on March 19.  Our assessment now....is that we could possibly have achieved the same effects and avoided some of the unfortunate impacts by not locking down, but by instead keeping open but with infection control measures, Camilla Stoltenberg, NIPH\u0027s Director General (and the sister of Nato head Jens Stoltenberg) said in a TV interview earlier this month.No one doubts Norway\u0027s success in bringing the pandemic under control. On Friday, there were just 30 people in hospital with coronavirus and five on a ventilator. Only one person had died all week. The per capita death toll is now 44 per million people, just over a tenth of that seen in neighbouring Sweden, where 4,971 people have died.But this success has come at a prohibitive social and economic cost. An expert committee charged with carrying out a cost-benefit analysis into the lockdown measures in April estimated that they had together cost Norway 27bn kroner (£2.3) every month. With only 0.7 per cent of Norwegians infected, according to NIPH estimates, there is almost no immunity in the population.The expert committee concluded last Friday that the country should avoid lockdown if there is a second wave of infections.We recommend a much lighter approach, the committee\u0027s head, Steinar Holden, an Oslo University economics professor, told the Sunday .  We should start with measures at an inidual level -- which is what we have now -- and if there’s a second wave, we should have measures in the local area where this occurs, and avoid measures at a national level if that is possible.Norway\u0027s current strategy -- using testing, contact tracing, and home isolation to keep the level of infections down without heavy restrictions -- would be best, the report concluded. But if this \u0027keep down\u0027 strategy fails to prevent a surge in cases, a \u0027brake strategy\u0027 which aims to suppress the rate of transmission but not bring it below 1, would be preferable to a lockdown.If it’s necessary to have very strict restrictions for a long time, then the costs are higher than letting the infection go through the population, Holden told the . Because that would be immensely costly.According to the report, a brake strategy would cost as much as 234bn kroner (£20bn) less than an unstable keep-down scenario, if you assume that those infected gain immunity and that no vaccine is developed until 2023. But it would also lead to a little over 3,000 additional deaths.  One measure that no one thinks should be reimposed is school closures.Holden\u0027s committee estimated in April that the measure had cost 6.7 bn kroner (£520m) a month, while at best having little impact on the spread of infection. NIPH has gone further, and suggested that school closures may have even increased the spread.Margrethe Greve-Isdahl, the doctor who is NIPH\u0027s expert on infections in schools, told the  that if schools hadn\u0027t been closed, they could have played a role in informing people in immigrant communities - which were hit disproportionately hard by the epidemic - of hygiene and social distancing rules.They can learn these measures in school and teach their parents and grandparents, so at least for some of these hard-to-reach minorities, there might be a positive effect from keeping kids in school.There were also fears in late March and April that adolescents were spreading the virus more out of schools than they would have been in them. There were large groups of adolescents that were hanging out together and not necessarily following any preventive measures, Greve-Isdahl said.  But perhaps the main reason Norway is unlikely to close schools again, whatever happens in future waves of infection, is the recognition of the impact on the most vulnerable pupils.  There\u0027s now a lot of information available on how it has impacted negatively on the economy and on vulnerable children. Their whole care system has kind of collapsed, Greve-Isdahl says. I think there would be it would be difficult to impose heavy restrictions again.Norway, it seems, has already decided a second lockdown is not the way to go, however much the infection flares up again. But that does not mean its prime minister has any regrets.I think it was the right to do at the time, she said. Based on the information we had, we took a precautionary strategy.It will probably never be possible to know, she added, which of the lockdown measures Norway imposed caused the number of infections to drop away so sharply, if any.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mysterious woman royal collection portrait identified king henry","story":"It has been in the Royal Collection for hundreds of years, catalogued anonymously as a “Portrait of a Woman”, possibly copied from a lost picture by Hans Holbein, court painter to Henry VIII. Now its sitter has been identified as Mary Boleyn, the king’s beguiling mistress and sister of his beheaded second wife Anne. The new research firmly links the picture to a set of 14 “Beauties” that decorated Queen Anne’s Bathing Room at Windsor Castle 300 years ago - only to be separated in the 19th century because it looked so different from the others. Although the pictures were each painted in the 17th century and have similar gilt frames, this one seemed the odd-one-out because the sitter is in 16th-century dress. The other portraits are all 17th-century aristocrats - from a duchess to countesses, each possibly copied from original pictures by Royal painters of the day, Sir Anthony van Dyck and Sir Peter Lely, with one by Samuel Cooper, the miniature painter.In the 19th century, the 13 portraits were eventually moved to Queen Victoria’s Drawing Room at Windsor, and more recently to Highgrove, the private residence of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. The 14th portrait had been sent to Hampton Court in the 19th century and then, in 1995, to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, where it hangs today in Mary, Queen of Scots’ bedroom.Now new evidence has emerged through dendrochronology tests, dating the picture’s wood and determining its origin, as well as investigations into the paintings’ provenance and comparative analysis. Seventeenth-century inscriptions on two other paintings in private British collections offered further proof of the sitters’ identities.To the astonishment of art historians, the wood of the 14th portrait matched another portrait in the set which, in turn, was found to have a direct link to Mary Boleyn in being identified as Lady Herbert, who married her great-grandson.The discoveries have been made by The Jordaens Van Dyck Panel Paintings Project (JVDPPP), which is based in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts in Brussels and focusses on the Flemish masters Van Dyck and Jacques Jordaens.Desmond Shawe-Taylor, Surveyor of the Queen’s Pictures, told the Sunday : “It’s absolutely fascinating. We don’t have the resources to apply technical examination like dendrochronology to the whole collection, which is 7,000 paintings, so it’s wonderful to collaborate with the JVDPPP to help us in that way. One of the things that I’m endlessly trying to do is to group the paintings properly to sort out their history and their relationship to each other.“When a stray is reunited with the family, there’s joy in heaven. It disproportionately increases the value and understanding of the whole group.”Describing the paintings as “absolutely beautiful”, he said that the set could now be reunited.Justin Davies, a British art historian and JVDPPP co-founder, said of the research: “It’s been a voyage of discovery. The results were remarkable and unexpected. Six of the 14 panels had been made from the same oak tree. The tree had started growing in south-west Germany before 1393 and was cut down between 1651 and 1671. In itself, this result constitutes a world record - six panel paintings from the same tree had not been recorded before.” He added: “The remaining eight pictures are four pairs of two in terms of their trees of origin. The Portrait of a Woman in 16th-century dress was an exact match for the only unidentified lady in the 13, the Portrait of a Lady in 17th-century dress. The two panels were made from an oak tree which grew in the Baltic region from the middle ages until it was cut down after 1629.”All 14 of the paintings are thought to be by Remigius van Leemput, a Flemish artist who came to London in the 1630s, working in the studio of Van Dyck, whose paintings he specialised in copying.Mr Davies said: “Van Leemput was an incredibly talented painter. Charles I hung his copies in his palaces. Van Leemput is right up there, at the top of his game. Painters of that era were absolutely delighted when their paintings were copied because it advertised their wares. Beauties were extremely fashionable… and Van Leemput’s are beautiful.”They are all the more appreciated today because not all the original paintings from which they were copied have survived. The 14 pictures are listed in an 18th-century inventory in the Royal Collection. Mr Shawe-Taylor said that the 14th picture was catalogued in the 19th century as a Holbein portrait of Anne Boleyn. By 1861, it had become “a portrait of a lady of the Court of Henry VIII”, he said. “So it’s been an anonymous person in Tudor costume until now.”Mr Davies’s detective work took him to the Heinz Library and Archive at the National Portrait Gallery where he found photographs of two paintings in private British collections with crucial inscriptions proving that the 17th-century sitter was ‘Lady Herbert’ and the 16th-century one was Mary Boleyn. Further research revealed that Lady Herbert was formerly Margaret Smith, who had married Thomas Carey, the great-grandson of Mary Boleyn. After his death in 1634, she married Sir Edward Herbert.Mr Davies said of the “wonderful discoveries on these beautiful ladies”: “It’s reuniting a set and it’s identifying two in the set who’ve been unidentified for 300 years.”   More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed test trace abandoned system could cope five coronavirus","story":"Britain’s disastrous decision to abandon testing for coronavirus occurred because health systems could only cope with five cases a week, official documents show.Newly-released papers from the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies shows routine testing and tracing of contacts was stopped because Public Health England’s systems were struggling to deal with a handful of cases.At a meeting on Feb 18, advisors said PHE could only cope with testing and tracing contacts of five Covid-19 cases a week, with modelling suggesting it might only be possible to increase this to 50 cases.Advisors then agreed it was sensible to shift to stopping routine testing - despite acknowledging that such a decision would “generate a public reaction”.The decision to give up on testing those with symptoms of coronavirus is now seen as the key reason the UK has the highest death rate in Europe.Over the next month the Government will roll out a national contact tracing scheme 14 weeks after officials raised the country\u0027s poor readiness for such a scheme.England is now recording around 8,000 new cases of Covid-19 a day and the NHS test and trace system is promising to warn up to 10,000 people a day that they have been near someone who has tested positive.The end of routine testing in the UK came on March 12, when Boris Johnson announced that anyone with symptoms of coronavirus should simply stay home for a week. On this day the UK recorded 421 new cases.However, after the virus raged uncontrolled through the UK that month, ministers were forced back to nationwide testing, announcing a five pillar plan on April 2, which finally led to a nationwide tracing service launched this week.A desperate initial shortage of capacity to test and trace is detailed among 51 papers released on Friday, including minutes of 34 meetings, which occurred from 22 January to May 7. They reveal the crucial decisions which led to the disastrous decision to abandon routine testing - which is only now being ramped back up.Minutes of a key Sage meeting on Feb 18 state: “Currently PHE can cope with five new cases a week (requiring isolation of 800 contacts). Modelling suggests this capacity could be increased to 50 new cases a week (8,000 contact isolations) but this assumption needs to be stress tested with PHE operational colleagues.”Sage concluded: “When there is sustained transmission in the UK, contact tracing will no longer be useful.”Two days later, Sage’s scientists agreed that plans drawn up for PHE on discontinuing contact tracing are “sensible,” the minutes show.  “Any decision to discontinue contact tracing will generate a public reaction – which requires consideration with input from behavioural scientists,” the minutes of February 20 note.The chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, suggested the nation would abandon routine testing on March 5, in part because there was now a slim to zero chance of avoiding a global pandemic.  Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, later claimed abandoning testing was a policy choice because “there comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention”. The Government\u0027s consistent position at the time was that they were following scientific advice.However, the World Health Organisation said countries were not doing enough to test and isolate cases. At the same time, its chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urging countries to “test, test, test.” As the pandemic took hold across the world, Germany was carrying out 50,000 tests a day at a point when Britain could only manage 5,000.The UK now has seen more than 38,000 deaths - more than four times as many deaths than Germany. Former health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the decision to abandon testing and tracing will rank as one of the “biggest failures of scientific advice to ministers in our lifetimes”.Earlier this month Sir Patrick Vallance, chief scientific advisor, singled out the failure to ramp up testing as one of the key errors in Britain’s handling of the crisis.I think if we\u0027d managed to ramp up testing capacity quicker, it would have been beneficial he said. And, you know, for all sorts of reasons that didn\u0027t happen,” he told MPs.The Government has since come under fire for a litany of testing failures, and criticism for repeatedly missed targets to carry out 100,000 tests a day.Sage minutes also suggest the new tracing strategy - which only tracks contacts after a case is confirmed positive- may not be sufficient. A meeting on May 1 says that in the initial stage of the programme contacts should be asked to isolate as soon as they are linked to a suspected case, rather than delaying until it is confirmed.Last night, Public Health England said it was certain it had capacity to track and trace more than five cases at the time of the minutes from the Sage meeting.However, a spokeswoman was unable to clarify whether Public Health England would have been able cope with 50 cases outlined in the Sage modelling.The model used an assumption of five importation events per week in the initial phase, a spokeswoman for PHE said. This means five imported cases and subsequent cases that may arise as a consequence of those imported cases the modelling considered the associated contacts for both. Modelling stated that the number of contacts could be managed by PHE. A Government spokesman said: We have successfully launched NHS Test and Trace, to help us keep this virus under control and save lives, while carefully and safely lifting the lockdown nationally.“Local councils have plans in place to respond to Covid-19. To support the rollout of NHS Test and Trace, we asked all councils to extend their existing plans into dedicated Local Outbreak Plans by the end of June. Last week we gave all councils £300 million new, dedicated funding to support councils to do all they can to make Test and Trace a success.We now have the 25,000 tracers we need to help control the virus, and hope the public will do their bit to keep the infection rate downMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sleepwalking one denial liberties even insidious phase","story":"When you think about it, there is something very odd about the farrago of the last week. Endless numbers of MPs, many of them Conservative, and a similarly vast array of media outlets received outraged demands for the sacking of the prime minister’s adviser because he allegedly transgressed the rules which have damaged the quality of life of ordinary people. Those who complained said that the deprivations and sacrifices which they have endured at such cost to their personal happiness and welfare were mocked by Dominic Cummings’ actions.But wait a minute - I thought that the great majority of people were not bothered much at all by the lockdown restrictions? According to almost every opinion poll that has been published over this extraordinary period, a clear message has gone out from the country: No, we’re really not fussed about having to stay under house arrest, locked away from our beloved families and closest friends. It’s pretty nice, actually - an extended break from the pressures of work and social demands.So we are quite content to sign away our rights as freeborn Englishmen and women to move about and associate with whomever we wish (even the right to a family life which we grant unreservedly to asylum seekers) for the indefinite future. We’re not even particularly worried about how much education our children are losing - certainly not missing the early morning school run, ha ha. Give us a shout when it’s over but we personally will be sad to see it end.That’s been, overall, the resounding sentiment, hasn’t it? So which is it? Are most people quite unbothered about the unprecedented restrictions to which they have been subjected (in which case, the possible infringement of those restrictions would be of little interest) or not? Of course, the obvious answer is that these are not the same groups of people: the ones who tell the opinion pollsters that, as far as they are concerned, this can go on forever are living quite different sorts of lives from those who are aggrieved by how much they have had to give up.But is this necessarily true? Many of the former lot could be public sector employees who are currently enjoying a holiday on full pay but whose political orientation is likely to incline them to attack the Tory government at every opportunity. So they could easily have it both ways: saying, quite honestly, that they are having a lovely time under the present dispensation, but still joining in the media chorus of condemnation of the government when it suits them.Then there are those innocents who are now pleasantly “furloughed” but who are about to discover when their firms are made to pay a proportion (even on the Chancellor’s gradualist scheme) of their wages, that they are, in fact, unemployed. They could easily have fallen in with the happy-to-be-locked-down brigade when their actual interests should properly be with the furious squad whose prospects in the immediate future have been pretty much wrecked by the economic shutdown.This is all very confusing but I think there may be one safe conclusion. That the people who are expressing genuine (as opposed to confected) rage have been angry about the conditions of lockdown for a long time but were being bullied into silence by the apparent quiescence - indeed contentment - of such a large proportion of the population. Ashamed to admit they were not gladly adhering to these unnatural, dehumanising prohibitions, they were silent - until faced with what they saw as an affront to their own forbearance.In other words, the lockdown has been much more destructive of public good will than the government may have been led to believe by superficial surveys. The only really informative thing about the events of the past week - and the media obsession which prolonged it - is that it has given us a sense of the extent of public discontent over lockdown that has been hidden for the duration. The serious debate in which the country should have been engaged has been almost entirely drowned out by phoney, self-serving political noise.So let’s have the proper argument, shall we? We can start by asking the right questions - which is to say, the ones that journalists at the Downing Street briefing did not bother to ask at last week’s launch of the test and trace system that is now proposed as the only way out of lockdown.Should a free society tolerate the introduction of a witch finder surveillance system in which anyone who happens to test positive for a virus is permitted to trigger the incarceration of any other person for 14 days, possibly in solitary confinement if he or she is the sole member of the household, simply by naming them, without any fear of being identified as the “accuser”?Will the person doing the naming automatically be believed? Will there be any conceivable defence for those so named against such an allegation - considering that it is not possible to learn who has made it? What power will it put into the hands of, say, a malicious, or just mischievous, seeker of revenge against a professional rival or an estranged sexual partner?But even assuming that there is no gratuitous or deliberate misuse of this awesome capability, what kind of precedent does it set? Is it acceptable, on principle, for any unvetted inidual to have the authority, simply by his unsubstantiated testimony, to inflict what would generally be regarded as punishment without trial on any number of other citizens? Even someone accused of a major crime has a legal right to know the identity of his accuser and to defend himself against the charge.Maybe under the circumstances of a public health crisis, this suspension of normal civil rights is justifiable and legal. But surely we should be discussing its ramifications - which are profoundly disturbing. As it is, we seem to be walking blindly from one devastatingly comprehensive denial of our liberties to another more subtle and insidious phase. And we know now that a public that had seemed cheerfully obliging in the first stage was actually quietly furious. Wait till they experience the next one.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/21/15/credit-cards.jpg","title":"credit card loan repayment holiday banks figures coronavirus","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Interest-free overdrafts of £500 have been offered to more than 27 million customer accounts, banking trade body saysAlmost 1.5 million payment holidays have been handed out to customers facing temporary financial difficulties due to the coronavirus crisis, according to the banking trade body.Credit card companies have also granted payment freezes on 877,800 customer accounts - increasing by 26 per cent since the start of the month, UK Finance said.The group, which represents most UK banks, added its members have given almost 608,000 payment holidays on personal loans - up 30 per cent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesInterest-free overdrafts of £500 have been offered to more than 27 million customer accounts.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSome 8.4 million workers are on furlough, meaning they are not working and the government is paying 80 per cent of their wages up to £2,500 a month.Firms will have to begin covering employers’ national insurance and pensions contributions for furloughed workers from 1 August.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?They will pay 100 per cent of wages for the hours that part-time furloughed employees are at work. In September, the government will pay 70 per cent of wages for the hours that a furloughed worker doesn’t work, with employers contributing 10 per cent. With NI and pension contributions, that will equate to employers covering 14 per cent of gross employment costs.In October the government will pay 60 per cent of wages with employers contributing 20 per cent – representing 23 per cent of gross employment costs. These costs will create an incentive for companies to get employees back to work where possible. It will also leave them with a decision to make about whether or not to keep some staff on.Mr Sunak said: “Now, as we begin to reopen our country and kickstart our economy, these schemes will adjust to ensure those who are able to work can do so, while remaining amongst the most generous in the world.”When asked about potential job losses when the changes are implemented the chancellor said: “There will be hardship ahead for many and that rests heavily on my shoulders.”He said the government would work to get people who lose their jobs back into employment as soon as possible.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The job retention scheme is forecast to cost about £80bn by the end of October, though most analysts agree that the impact of not intervening adequately would have been far greater.Mike Cherry, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, welcomed the announcement, saying: “The government is giving hope to small firms right across the UK.”Frances O’Grady, general secretary of Trades Union Congress, said introducing part-time furlough earlier was the right decision. “This will help employers gradually and safely bring people back to work, protect jobs and support the economy to recover,” Ms O’Grady said.Why the furlough reforms risk a hard landing for the economy“As employers begin to contribute to the costs of furlough, we remain pleased that all workers will continue to receive at least 80 per cent of their wages for every hour worked until the scheme closes in October. However, the government needs to act urgently to make sure workers with health conditions or childcare responsibilities aren’t first in line when it comes to redundancies.”Kathleen Heycock, employment partner at law firm Farrer \u0026amp Co, warned that women are more likely to be in the firing line for redundancy as the furlough scheme is wound down.Mothers will be under “huge pressure” to manage competing work and childcare responsibilities, Ms Heycock said.“In reality, the threat of redundancies and instability in the job market may well mean women increasingly having to work longer hours to keep up with demands at work and at home, whilst fearing vocalising worries could leave them in a vulnerable position.“We must be wary that there is a risk of polarising an already hugely prevalent issue of the ‘maternity penalty’, meaning women taking time out to care for children either as formal leave or by part-time working suffer discrimination in the workplace.”Business groups and some think tanks had called for the government to adjust the furlough scheme in specific ways for different industries, giving more help to those businesses like pubs and restaurants that do not know when they will be allowed to reopen and which may be operating below capacity for a longer period than others.But the Treasury rejected the proposal, saying it was difficult to draw lines between who was deemed to work in which sector and would therefore be too complex to implement.Self-employed workers will be able to apply for a second grant from August which will be calculated at 70 per cent of average monthly trading profits up to £6,570 in total. That is less generous than a previous grant of up to £7,500 which covered 80 per cent of earnings. Some 2.3 million people have so far claimed under the self-employed income support scheme. The government resisted calls to extend support to those who are ineligible, including people who have become self-employed in the past year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSome 8.4 million workers are on furlough, meaning they are not working and the government is paying 80 per cent of their wages up to £2,500 a month.Firms will have to begin covering employers’ national insurance and pensions contributions for furloughed workers from 1 August.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?They will pay 100 per cent of wages for the hours that part-time furloughed employees are at work. In September, the government will pay 70 per cent of wages for the hours that a furloughed worker doesn’t work, with employers contributing 10 per cent. With NI and pension contributions, that will equate to employers covering 14 per cent of gross employment costs.In October the government will pay 60 per cent of wages with employers contributing 20 per cent – representing 23 per cent of gross employment costs. These costs will create an incentive for companies to get employees back to work where possible. It will also leave them with a decision to make about whether or not to keep some staff on.Mr Sunak said: “Now, as we begin to reopen our country and kickstart our economy, these schemes will adjust to ensure those who are able to work can do so, while remaining amongst the most generous in the world.”When asked about potential job losses when the changes are implemented the chancellor said: “There will be hardship ahead for many and that rests heavily on my shoulders.”He said the government would work to get people who lose their jobs back into employment as soon as possible.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The job retention scheme is forecast to cost about £80bn by the end of October, though most analysts agree that the impact of not intervening adequately would have been far greater.Mike Cherry, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, welcomed the announcement, saying: “The government is giving hope to small firms right across the UK.”Frances O’Grady, general secretary of Trades Union Congress, said introducing part-time furlough earlier was the right decision. “This will help employers gradually and safely bring people back to work, protect jobs and support the economy to recover,” Ms O’Grady said.Why the furlough reforms risk a hard landing for the economy“As employers begin to contribute to the costs of furlough, we remain pleased that all workers will continue to receive at least 80 per cent of their wages for every hour worked until the scheme closes in October. However, the government needs to act urgently to make sure workers with health conditions or childcare responsibilities aren’t first in line when it comes to redundancies.”Kathleen Heycock, employment partner at law firm Farrer \u0026amp Co, warned that women are more likely to be in the firing line for redundancy as the furlough scheme is wound down.Mothers will be under “huge pressure” to manage competing work and childcare responsibilities, Ms Heycock said.“In reality, the threat of redundancies and instability in the job market may well mean women increasingly having to work longer hours to keep up with demands at work and at home, whilst fearing vocalising worries could leave them in a vulnerable position.“We must be wary that there is a risk of polarising an already hugely prevalent issue of the ‘maternity penalty’, meaning women taking time out to care for children either as formal leave or by part-time working suffer discrimination in the workplace.”Business groups and some think tanks had called for the government to adjust the furlough scheme in specific ways for different industries, giving more help to those businesses like pubs and restaurants that do not know when they will be allowed to reopen and which may be operating below capacity for a longer period than others.But the Treasury rejected the proposal, saying it was difficult to draw lines between who was deemed to work in which sector and would therefore be too complex to implement.Self-employed workers will be able to apply for a second grant from August which will be calculated at 70 per cent of average monthly trading profits up to £6,570 in total. That is less generous than a previous grant of up to £7,500 which covered 80 per cent of earnings. Some 2.3 million people have so far claimed under the self-employed income support scheme. The government resisted calls to extend support to those who are ineligible, including people who have become self-employed in the past year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s absolutely clear he did break regulations. He found one tiny clause which he said made an exception, but that didn’t cover the journey to Barnard Castle, it was nonsense, absolute nonsense.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continued: “People were cross because they think he’s taking us for idiots. The eye test thing is marvellous, the idea you’re not sure whether you can drive back to London, so in order to check your eyesight you put your four year old in the back of the car and drive around to see if you knock over any pedestrians or smack into a bollard, and that way you know your eyes aren’t there.“His greatest irritation is, he said at the beginning, ‘The press are giving misinformation about my whereabouts.’ That’s his job. He got his wife to write pieces in The Spectator suggesting he was in London, which he wasn’t.Sam Neill: ‘Science was neglected, and that’s biting us on the arse’Tracee Ellis Ross: ‘We’re in a moment of dehumanisation’BBC apologises after presenter calls Dominic Cummings a ‘d***\u0027 on air“So he’s very, very cross. This man has become the centre of the story. I cannot understand why he hasn’t resigned.”Many fans of the show took to Twitter to praise Hislop’s “roasting” of Cummings.“Enjoying Ian Hislop absolutely lacerating Dominic Cummings on HIGNFY,” tweeted Piers Morgan. “There, I’ve said it.”Kathy Burke added: “Prime Minister Dominic Cummings was brilliantly roasted on HIGNFY tonight. Ian Hislop was pitch perfect.”More than 1 million people have signed a petition calling for Cummings to be sacked over allegedly breaching the lockdown rules.Despite Downing Street’s attempts to shift focus away from the row, hundreds of thousands of people added their names to the petition demanding that the prime minister fire his chief aide.Johnson is standing by his top adviser amid controversy of Cummings’ decision to drive 260 miles to his parents’ house in Durham at the height of lockdown.While there, Cummings also made a 25-mile trip to Barnard Castle, which he sought to justify by claiming he wanted to test his eyesight ahead of the much longer drive back to London so he could resume his work at No 10.Have I Got News For You\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Of the 45 patients involved in Phase 1 of the trials, findings have only been released for eight subjects.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The study is also testing the vaccine candidate in adults aged 56 to 70, and those 71 and older.The durability of the antibodies – how long they last – equally remains unclear. At the time of Moderna’s press release, the trial was into its 43rd day – while only two weeks had passed after those patients who returned positive results were injected with their second dose of the vaccine.“While having data at 40 days would be of interest for the vaccine to be beneficial it will require persistence for several months and this will not be known until Phase 3 trials are conducted,” Professor Evans told The Independent.Scientists have also called for more detail regarding Moderna’s claims that its vaccine raised the levels of neutralising antibodies equivalent to those found in the blood plasma of recovered Covid-19 patients, urging the company to specify how many antibodies were produced in the subjects and how comparisons had been made.Those within the sector have pointed out that on the same day Moderna released its press release, the firm also carried out a stock offering, in which shares of the company were put to public investors.The company said it plans to primarily use the proceeds to fund manufacturing and distribution of its vaccine candidate.However, Knowledge Ecology International, an NGO that specialises in governance, intellectual property and health policy, said there is “a jarring difference between the transparency that the public wants and what we are getting”.Director James Love, who is currently consulting with the US Department of Health \u0026amp Human Services over its vaccine research, said in relation to the stock offering: “Companies should not use the public’s acute concerns about Covid-19 and the media’s intensive coverage of the pandemic.In April, the US government committed up to $483m (£386m) to Moderna’s vaccine development.A senior source involved in the global coordination of efforts to research and fund a Covid-19 vaccine called last week’s press release – and the subsequent stock offer that was announced – “very questionable”.This is the truth about a future coronavirus vaccine“I’ve been appalled by what I saw,” the source said. “What they did was very questionable they actually released some non-peer reviewed data which are very preliminary. The way you handle the data is very important in terms of credibility.“At the same time, they did a stock offering. You make a press release and the stock is going up, and then you do a stock offering and you cash in. It’s a lot of money.“A press release is a typical biotech approach when they want to boost their stock price.”Moderna did not respond to questions about the timing of its stock offering.The source expressed “fear” that with more than 100 vaccine candidates currently in development, pharmaceutical companies could be drawn into a public relations war, with each firm rushing to declare their latest achievements without providing transparent data and information.“If we enter a battle of press releases I think we’re going to lose public trust completely,” he added. “I think if this turns into a competition of who has the best data and has made the most progress, we need some kind of neutral party that can look into the data and provide scrutiny.”Ms t’Hoen said that communicating “signs of progress” in the public has “immediate consequences for the value” of any company that is on the stock market.While there are “encouraging signs” to the firm’s data, according to Robin Shattock, professor of Mucosal Infection and Immunity at Imperial College London, this development represents the first step of many in a long process to produce an effective and safe vaccine.However, the company is moving fast and intends to roll out Phase 3 of its study in July, which would involve the large-scale vaccination of thousands of subjects across several sites to evaluate efficacy and safety under natural disease conditions.“These data substantiate our belief that mRNA-1273 has the potential to prevent Covid-19 disease and advance our ability to select a dose for pivotal trials,” said Tal Zaks, Moderna’s chief medical officer.Mr Bancel has refuted claims that the company did not release enough data, and told Fox News that more “will be published very soon”.The Independent has approached Moderna for further comment.National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A new launch time of 3.22pm (8.22pm UK time) has been scheduled for Saturday from Nasa\u0027s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWeather permitting, it won\u0027t just be those on the east coast of the US that will be able to see the launch. The trajectory of the Crew Dragon capsule means sky gazers in the UK will also be able to view the space craft as it passes overhead.It will look like any other satellite does – a spot moving across the sky in 5 minutes, astrophysicist Dr Darren Baskill, who lectures at the University of Sussex, told The Independent.Everything you need to know about SpaceX launchBecause the spaceship is small, it will be faint – so fine to see with the unaided eyes, but nowhere near as bright as the football-field sized International Space Station. Also, it will be low in the sky, so best seen from the South and the midlands, with a clear southern horizon.The first pass of the spacecraft will take place shortly after take-off, but it will be too light to see in the skies above the UK.A second pass at around 10.15pm will be visible to anyone facing south-west with a clear view of the horizon, so long as the skies stay clear.Several websites offer ways to track the Crew Dragon capsule, as well as the International Space Station (ISS), where it will eventually dock.The site Heavens Above gives specific details about the Crew Dragon craft, while a tool developed by the European Space Agency allows real-time tracking of the ISS.Live streams of the launch will also be hosted on the official Nasa and SpaceX YouTube channels, with close to 2 million people tuning in to the failed first launch.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.A Tory MP has apologised for leaving a template bereavement instruction in an email to one of his constituents who had contacted him about the prime minister’s top aide.Anthony Mangnall said he made a “stupid mistake” by leaving “insert if there has been a bereavement” in a message he sent in response to emails he received about Dominic Cummings\u0027 controversial trip to Durham during lockdown.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“The current situation has made the ability to mourn the passing of loved ones all the more difficult. I send my best wishes to you and your family.]”Mr Mangnall said the instruction was left in one response to hundreds of emails he had received about Mr Cummings in recent days.“In an effort to respond to those emails, I wrote in my own words my thoughts on the situation,” he tweeted.“That response contained some ‘insert lines’ that allowed me to respond to specific issues and concerns raised. I stupidly sent out one of those emails without having removed the additional lines.“This has caused a great deal of offence and I am incredibly sorry.”The recipient of the email, who requested anonymity, told The Independent Mr Mangnall\u0027s insert lines response was not at all relevant to the email they originally sent to the MP.The template response drew criticism about Mr Mangnall from many on social media, with some calling it “cut and paste compassion”.One person said: “Just a sign that many Tory MPs are too lacking emotionally and intellectually to be able to craft a letter for themselves.

Don’t even know where to start by how shoddy this effort is.”The MP for Totnes said he “shares many of the concerns” his constituents had about Mr Cummings’ trip to Durham and would not have taken the same “course of action” himself.However, he stopped short of calling for the resignation of Boris Johnson’s aide.Mr Mangnall wrote in a statement on Facebook: “The anger and dissatisfaction at Mr Cummings’ behaviour is no surprise at all.“Spending time defending an adviser is not a good use of time, especially given the many fears and concerns about people’s future and their livelihoods.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Felix Project has supplied 1,376 tons of produce since 23 March, the equivalent of 3,276,190 meals. This support has ameliorated the deep distress of those unable to afford or access food – in particular, families struggling below the breadline, NHS workers and the elderly.The sum raised from sales of Hirst’s rainbow butterfly hearts means that we are more than halfway to our goal of securing £10m for The Felix Project to help food-poor Londoners over the next three years. It is a pledge given added urgency by the latest jobless claims, which have surged to more than two million.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMore than 4,400 people backed our campaign by purchasing the Hirst limited edition prints – 3,109 bought the small size, costing £300 each, and 1,299 bought the large size, costing £1,000. The net proceeds amounted to £1.55m. Mr Hirst said: “It’s amazing to see how people have pulled together and helped each other during this crisis. I am so grateful to everyone who has helped me do my little bit and bought a butterfly heart edition – it’s turned out to be a brilliant communal way to help raise money for The Felix Project and support their important work across London.”How to support our campaignEvgeny Lebedev, shareholder in The Independent, said: “I have long believed in the power of art and this is a wonderful affirmation of that. With the support of Damien Hirst we have passed the halfway point in our mission to ensure no Londoner in any corner of the city goes hungry because of Covid.”Other substantial new donors to our campaign include management consultants McKinsey \u0026amp Company, whose employees voted to make our appeal partner their charity of choice.Olga Nefedova, associate partner, said: “We are making a donation to organisations helping our most vulnerable communities. The Felix Project is very much one of these organisations.”So far, more than six million meals have been delivered by the London Food Alliance – established in response to the coronavirus pandemic and made up of Felix, FareShare and City Harvest – of which over half have been supplied by The Felix Project.Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, paid tribute to the extraordinary all-round effort. “London was hit hard and fast – but oh, how it has stepped up and fought back,” he said. “We are inspired by the mobilisation of businesses, donors and supporters who have joined forces with our staff and volunteers.” The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis.

It was from a newly formed charity, The Felix Project, that wanted to use surplus food that would otherwise go to waste to feed the poor. The star of The Walking Dead and Britannia promptly called them to ask if he could volunteer.That first session — delivering fresh produce to eight different charities — made such a vivid impression on Mr Morrissey that he has since become regularly involved with Felix, now his favourite charity. “I was very impressed by the efficiency and simplicity of the operation, and yet at the same time it’s difficult because a big part of me wishes that The Felix Project didn’t have to exist,” he said.“You wish people didn’t have to rely on food parcels in London in this day and age, but the harsh reality is they do.” He added: “A lot of the people we give food to, they are proud people and a lot have jobs — but they’re still finding it hard to make ends meet, to support their families.” Often, admitted the 55-year-old, the people he delivers to recognise him. At Haringey Play Association, an adventure playground in the shadow of the new Spurs’ stadium, Mr Morrissey would arrive in his green Felix van to the amazement of the kids.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“There’s a bit of, oh my gosh, is that the governor off The Walking Dead?” he laughed. “It’s fun but you very quickly get over that and after a while they relate to you as a real person.”How to support our campaignMr Morrissey, inset in Britannia, introduced chef Melissa Hemsley to Felix and together they would join children at Haringey Play to cook up a storm with Felix delivered ingredients. “That was my best part,” he said. “Those cooking sessions with the kids at Haringey Play, I have never laughed so much.”He has also taken along his 25-year-old son to volunteer and helped fundraise by manning the phones along with actors Sir Ian McKellen and John Hamm.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis.

It is a fragile time, we have to be very careful.”He added: “Returning to a situation where we have lost control again is far worse than another week or two of social measures.”Their interventions came after Professor John Edmunds, another member of Sage, warned that Boris Johnson’s decision to allow the public greater freedom was “risky”.He also raised concerns about the new test and trace system launched on Thursday to track people infected by coronavirus, saying: “We can’t be sure that is working effectively yet, and yet we’re going ahead and making these changes anyway.”These concerns were echoed by Sir Jeremy Farrar, the respected director of the Wellcome Trust, who also attends Sage meetings.He said: “Covid-19 is spreading too fast to lift lockdown in England. Agree with John and clear science advice.Prof Van-Tam said at the daily Downing Street press conference that the government and the public had a “dual responsibility” to prevent a second wave of the virus, adding: “I believe this is also a very dangerous moment. We have to get this right.”He said scientific opinions “always vary to some extent”, and told the press conference that the lockdown easing must go “painstakingly” slowly.He added: “There is a dual responsibility here of government to go slowly and carefully and to take the advice from the scientists.“Of the scientists, to watch this whole thing very closely over the next few weeks.“And, of the public in general to actually follow the guidance. Don’t tear the pants out of it, and don’t go further than the guidance actually says.”Prof Van-Tam was also pressed on whether those in authority should set an example to the public on obeying the restrictions, amid an ongoing row over whether Dominic Cummings breached the rules by travelling 260 miles to his parents’ farm in County Durham.The senior medic made his feelings clear, saying: “In my opinion the rules are clear and they have always been clear.“In my opinion they are for the benefit of all. In my opinion they apply to all.”On the concerns, a No 10 spokesperson said: “As the PM said on Thursday when this next step was unveiled, we have at all times been informed by the data and evidence, and this package of measures has been carefully designed so that we can ease the burdens of lockdown while expecting to keep that R below one.”Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Over a million people have signed the petition, thousands have been in contact with their MPs, and polls show 63 per cent of the public want the prime minister to take his responsibilities seriously and show Mr Cummings the door. “Most worryingly, leading public health experts and police officers have warned that the Cummings scandal has eroded public trust in the rules and those who make them – putting lives at risk.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

and the number can also inform policy decisions about how to contain an outbreak.For example,a virus has an R of three, it means that every sick person will pass the disease on to three other peopleno containment measures are introduced.Its also worth pointing out that the R is a measure of how infectious a disease is, but not how deadly.Taking London as an example, with a current R value of . for coronavirus, it means that for every ten people who have the virus, it will be passed on to only four more people.The low R value means thateveryone continues lockdown and social distancing measures, London would theoretically be virus free by the end of May.The World Health Organisationestimated at the start of March that the coronavirus R stood somewhere between  and ..The UK is now generally below that because of the lockdown and the social distancing measures we have been doing over the past two months.In comparison, the seasonal flu is estimated to be roughly . while measles has a reproductive value of between  and .Despite this, these figures are not set in stone because a given pathogens R value changes with place and time.Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, told The : R is an indication of how much an infectious virus will spread in a population, and ious things impact that value.The susceptibility, size and density of the population that the infection is introduced into matters, as well as the infectiousness of the virus itself.Predictions of the R for Covid- are currently ied because no one knows exactly how many people have been infected in total.According to modelling published by Imperial College London, the R value stood somewhere between  and . in Europe before lockdowns came into effect.The most recent estimate of the nation-wide R-rate is said to be between . and ..Below R is the important bit because it means the virus will likely peter out, but things are generally worse in the north of England to the point that the trend could reverse.Data released on May  from Cambridge University suggested that in the North East and Yorkshire the R rate - the average number of people an infected person can pass the virus on to - is feared to be at around ..The South West has an R rate of ., slightly more than the North West which has a rate of ..Both the East of England and South East have a rate of ., followed by the Midlands with . and finally London with ..On May , , Boris Johnson urged the British public to help reduce the R value.In his address to the nation, he said: It depends on all of us – the entire country – to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down.He added: We must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease - the R - back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago.And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid Alert System run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre.And that Covid Alert Level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases.He continued: And in turn that Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures.The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.During one of the Downing Street press conferences, Sir Patrick Vallance revealed that it was highly likely there is an R value in the community of less than one.This means that every infected inidual passes the disease to less than one other person.This shows the lockdown has had a positive impact on the coronavirus outbreak as to bring an outbreak under control the R value needs to fall below one.However, when the number remains higher than one, the epidemic will grow.Sir Patrick admitted that the R value could be higher in some care homes and hospitals.He said: As I’ve said, it’s not true that the R is necessarily below one in every hospital or in every care home, and that’s the important area that we now need to look at and make sure that the appropriate measures are in place to try and reduce the R there.But it doesn’t change the overall view that I’ve described, that the R overall is below one and therefore we expect to see the slowing and the turn of the epidemic.There are lots of infection control measures experts can use to push this number down and reduce the spread.A study in the Lancet in April, for example, estimated that travel restrictions in Wuhan caused R to drop from . to . after just one week.Sir Patrick said that the draconian social distancing measures introduced in the UK have had a substantial impact so far.This is because as less people come into contact with one another, there is less chance for the virus to spread.He said on Thursday, April : The social distancing measures are needed to reduce the levels right down to a low level.At that point there may be decisions about which ones to relax and which ones not to relax.It’s important to keep the R below one, and this is all about trying to reduce contacts, particularly between households, reduce transmission and keep the levels low across the community.And Sir Patrick added that even small changes in the measures that are in place could lead to the R going above one.According to a pre-print study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the average number of people an inidual comes into contact with each day has dropped by  per cent since the UK’s lockdown began.“This would be sufficient to reduce R from a value from . before the lockdown to . during the lockdown, indicating that physical distancing interventions are effective,” the study, which tracked over , adults and has not yet been peer reviewed, concluded.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, he hadn’t.“The country can see that and it’s shocked the Government cannot,” she added, before accusing the Prime Minister of “blind loyalty” to Cummings.Then she added, for good measure, that the country had reacted with “fury, contempt and anguish”.I suppose she thought she was speaking for the country with this tendentious, pompous bilge.She was not. She was speaking for herself and those in her North London liberal bubble.The BBC demands that its presenters remain neutral on political matters.Obviously, they don’t. But at least they usually pretend to. Maitlis can’t even manage that. Anyway, the complaints flooded in to Auntie.If this was the first time she’d crossed the line then maybe we might be a little lenient. But it’s not. Far from it.Last September, for example, she managed to force the BBC into that very rarest of things — a public apology, for her appalling behaviour and bias.In an interview she conducted on the programme she was, the BBC concluded, “sneering and bullying”, she was “too persistent and bullying” and “failed to be even-handed”.That was a landmark judgment. I have it framed on the wall of my downstairs khazi. Because the person she had been interviewing was ME.I had turned up to do a debate about Brexit. I was met with a wall of vituperation and abuse that even embarrassed the bloke I was supposed to be debating with, an affable Remainer chap called Tom Baldwin.The BBC warned Newsnight, its hopeless editor and Maitlis that such a breach of neutrality must not happen in the future.It has happened again. So what are they going to do about it  The BBC has admitted Newsnight got it terribly wrong.And will do nothing. Again.Here’s the other thing. I was sacked by the BBC for breaching its code of neutrality. Rightly.I had written an article about how much I hated fox hunting and fox hunters, right at the time the Government was planning to ban the cruel, obnoxious sport.The BBC was right then. But at least I hadn’t broadcast those views on the BBC itself, or allowed them to influence the programme I edited, the Today programme. It was just stuff I wrote in a leftie newspaper.Maitlis broadcasts her idiotic views on her programme!The BBC has to be consistent about this or drop the pretence of neutrality altogether.And for Emily — have some guts, woman.You want a  for your views  Go work for a radio station in the private sector, or get a newspaper column,you can.The BBC has, in the main, behaved well over Covid. But always with the exception of Newsnight.Always with the exception of Maitlis.IF you remember, just before lockdown, it was rumoured that the Spice Girls might get back together.There were gigs planned for next month.“Christ help us,” we all thought. And then we all got down on our knees and thanked Covid for scuppering that idea.Now, however, lockdown looks like it will be eased. Which means they might well fix some new dates. Yikes, etc.I suppose we could tell them the latest scientic news. Singing, apparently, is really bad for spreading the virus everywhere.Choirs and stuff have been banned in some countries. So we could try that line.But then I suppose Sporty and Co might well reply: “You could hardly call what we do singing.”DID you see those hacks questioning the Prime Minister’s adviser, Dominic Cummings on Monday One after another they all stepped up, wreathed in self-importance.And all asked exactly the same question. Over and over again. And therefore got exactly the same response.What the hell is the point of that Did they all think that they would be the only person to ask: “Why is it one law for you and one law for everyone , Mr Cummings ”Did they think they were dead clever coming up with that line Incredible. Thick as a plate of mince, some of us journos.GLORY, glory. Denmark is to open its borders once again.You can travel to the countryyou can prove that you’re dating someone Danish.In my case I think I’d choose one of the models Maja Krag or Terese Pagh Teglgaard – crazy names, crazy girls. I don’t know how I’d prove it to the Danish customs people.Maybe just show them a photoshopped picture of me and Maja out on the town.Anyway, that’syou WANT to visit Denmark.I went there once and was pretty underwhelmed. It was like a middle-class version of Lincolnshire.SO what exactly have YOU accomplished during lockdown A few jigsaw puzzles and watched the entirety of Netflix Listen to this. In  the Bubonic Plague struck London once again. Cambridge University was closed down.And so the young Isaac Newton was forced to leave his studies andhome to Grantham, Lincs, under lockdown.And during this spare time he invented the branch of mathematics known as calculus. And then he discovered the laws of gravity.Oh, and formulated a theory of light which dominated science for the next century and beyond. All done under lockdown.And what have I done  Put out the patio furniture and completed a giant jigsaw puzzle of my own face.Depressing, innit FUNNY, isn’t it, how most of the people screaming blue murder about Dominic Cummings were fervent anti-Brexiteers Cummings was the key architect of the Vote Leave campaign – and the Remoaners utterly loathe the bloke.Among the Remoaners screaming their little heads off are a bunch of Church of England bishops.These include Leeds Bishop “Nick” Baines, who has referred to the Prime Minister as a “liar” and a “bully”.No wonder the Church of England’s attendances have collapsed over the past  years.The Cof E is another institution that has lost its moral compass and is utterly out of step with the rest of the country.THE Chinese government is bullying Hong Kong once again.Thousands of armed police are on the streets, battling protesters.The row is over a new law which makes it a criminal offence to take the p*** out of the Chinese national anthem.Only a deeply insecure totalitarian state would create such a law.Meanwhile, the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, has told his people to “prepare for war”.I don’t know who against.I think Xi has finally understood that the rest of the world is sick to the back teeth of his foul, bullying, communist dictatorship.And once this Chinese pandemic is over we might be more inclined to stand up for ourselves.THE Home ­Secretary Priti Patel is determined to stop economic migrants flooding here from across the Channel.She wants new powers to send boats back to France. Good for her.Since the turn of the year more than , illegal immigrants have arrived on our shores from our neighbours.Brexit Britain is an even more popular destination than it was before we left the EU. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He also attempted to master Japanese during two seasons at League club Nagoya Grampus Eight.Gary explains why sticking to your mother tongue could be an own goal, both on and off the pitch . . .MASTERING a language is one of the most important things you can do.That became apparent to me when, on arriving in Spain, I decided to buy some furniture.Keen that my bedside cabinets had drawers, I asked the shop assistantthey had two tables “con cojones”.The poor woman burst out laughing and explained that in Spanish, drawers are “cajones” not “cojones” — I’d accidentally asked for two tables with testicles.I couldn’t speak a word of Spanish when I signed for Barcelona but I knew I needed to learn the lingo.I had realised that players at foreign clubs who immerse themselves in the culture do better on the pitch than those who don’t.I looked to greats such as Kevin Keegan, who learned German when he joined Hamburg, and Ray Wilkins, who mastered Italian at AC Milan.Then there were others — who I won’t name — who were lured abroad just for the bigger pay packet back in the day and barely lasted a season.I’d studied a small amount of French and German at school but I was so focused on becoming a footballer I didn’t put the effort in.I had a bit of a wake-up call over my lack of language skills on my first day of training.It’s a shock to the system being in a changing room full of blokes bantering and you have no idea what they are saying.Luckily, the team took me under their wing. On the bus to the training grounds Barcelona keeper Andoni Zubizarreta drew a stick man and woman and taught me all the body parts.To get a firmer grip on the language I avoided the ex-pat nightclubs out there and enrolled in a Spanish language class with my then we Michelle and my team-mate Mark Hughes.Poor Mark was only  and struggled with the classes. I think he dropped out after two or three but Michelle and I stuck with it.For two years, three times a week after training, we’d go to school to learn Spanish.It was tough at first as no English was allowed in the classroom, but looking back it did me a world of good.I started playing football when I was small and the skills came naturally. Learning a language was the opposite. It was really hard work and not something that came easily to me.So I made sure I read Spanish newspapers every day and watched the local TV stations. In two months I could get by. After six months I was getting pretty good and in a year I was speaking pretty much fluently.By the time I left in  I was thinking and dreaming in Spanish.From the get go, I made sure I did my post-match interviews in the local language.EvenI didn’t always make sense, it sent out a strong message to the club that I was there for the long haul.Being able to talk to fans gained me a lot of respect and appreciation when I was over there.And when a match goes badly, the pitch can be a really lonely place. But because I was able to speak to my team-mates, it helped me through some tough times.When I went to play for Nagoya Grampus Eight in  it was a whole other story.I took eight months of Japanese lessons before I went out there, and did classes there too. But it is a very dficult language, with a completely dferent alphabet.I learned enough to get by but I was nowhere near as good at Japanese as I was with Spanish.It’s been more than  years since I lived in Barcelona and I’ll admit my Spanish is a bit rusty.Nowadays when I go there I’ll try to speak the language but Spaniards always want to speak to me in English.So many foreigners speak English that it can seem a pointless exercise trying to pick up another tongue.As a nation, we are not great at learning a second language, we can rest on our laurels slightly.But I would argue that it’s more important now than ever to learn, and at the moment we’ve all got the time to spare.Having a second language opens up so many opportun­ities to you and your kids, whether that’s working abroad or in hospitality in the UK.Travel might be shut at the moment, but that won’t be the case for ever and you’ll be giving your family a leg-up during this downtime.Children’s brains are like sponges, they pick up languages so much faster and better when they are younger.And there are so many online tools and courses that I wish I’d had at my disposal when I was first learning.Although I’d always warn against online translation tools — they give a very literal translation which doesn’t always make sense.For example,you type “it’s raining cats and dogs” into Google Translate it won’t mean anything to a foreigner in their own language.Getting kids to do anything can be tricky, as I’m sure mums and dads who are homeschooling have realised by now.In my Celebrity Supply Teacher episode I teach counting to ten in Spanish by doing keepy-ups.Soyou make it fun, it opens up an exciting new world for youngsters which doesn’t involve sitting at a desk.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Every day I walked down the corridor of my high school in New Zealand to that sort of abuse. “F***ing faggot.” “You poofter.” “Bum boy.” You can imagine.I became prepared for it and engineered a steely exterior. But each incident made it harder for me to be the person I knew I wanted to be and even more aware I was an outsider in a world where straight men dominate.While attitudes are thankfully changing, they still extend across many industries.One of my early bosses in newspapers told me recently that an editor had resisted hiring “the poof” .Luckily, that boss — a mentor during my career who happens to be straight — held firm and didn’t accept such blatant homophobia.I’m never one to moan about a lack of ersity or embrace identity politics — all minorities have to fight to overcome stereotypes. Taking on a victim mentality doesn’t help, which is why I never have.But it’s far too simplistic to look at Queer Eye, Graham Norton and Tom Daley then declare homophobia doesn’t strangle careers even now.That said, Adrian Chiles’ illuminating interview in The Sun this week with Luke Tuffs, who came out as a teenage player at Camberley Town in Surrey, provides reason for hope.Now manager of Ashford Town, he revealed that when he first told his team-mates in a drunken moment of madness they were “absolutely cool” about his sexuality. Of course, there’s “savage” banter in the “un-PC” dressing rooms but he explained: “I don’t think it comes from malice — it comes from love.”In fact, I’d hazard a guess the banter would be just as brutala player had ginger hair, an overweight girlfriend or a small willy. Banter is a prized part of British le and must not be wiped out by the snowflake brigade. It’s very dferent to abuse.The closeted players should also look to Phillip Schofield’s coming out announcement. What the This Morning host probably believed was going to be a le-changing event, dominating his every waking moment, has now been largely shrugged off. It was a damp squib in the best possible way.Sure, Phillip is gay. But he’s still hosting This Morning with Holly and that’s what people talk about. We don’t care who he is sleeping with.It is, of course, a deeply personal choice, but I would encourage footballers living miserably in the closet to try to change the way they think about coming out. Being the first will give them an opportunity no one  will ever have.While some archaic football fans may not be ready for it, I genuinely believe the vast majority of the country and our culture truly is.The opportunities will be limitless. The love will be overwhelming.Thirty years of fear will be turned on its head. We just need one brave announcement.Andwe’re not careful the red tape and draconian restrictions will kill off an already struggling high street.Take shoe shops, where staff will have to quarantine any footwear tried on for  hours.If you’ve worked in retail you’ll know how damn impractical that is.And,we’re being guided by the science, who the heck has ever contracted coronavirus via their toes while wearing socks Clothes shoppers will not be able to try on items in a changing room. Why not just order on Amazon then Estimates suggest these corona-ready measures will also cost companies. A lot. To the tune of £, a store, according to one estimate.Making the shopping experience miserable for retailers and customers won’t help save our economy, given recovery requires people wanting to go out and spend.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hard-working parents will be able to call on extended family for childcare help.And young people starved of social contact can meet in the park for a picnic.Thanks to the phenomenal efforts of Brits up and down the country, we have protected the NHS, saved lives, and passed the first peak of the virus.Which is why our cherished liberties are now being ed to us, albeit slowly.Now, we must do everything in our power to avoid a second wave.Let’s not let the new freedoms go to our heads.IT’S clear that track and trace is key to beating this virus.South Korea — which tracked and traced properly from the start — recently had an outbreak caused by one man going to a series of nightclubs.The incident could have led to a second peak. But contact-tracers found more than , iniduals and managed to isolate more than  people infected by the super-spreader. Which is why the Government must iron out the wrinkles in our programme NOW.Yes, getting the system up and running from a standing start has been a challenge. We know that Asian countries — which learnt how to track and trace during the Sars and Mers epidemics — were at an advantage.But surely the best minds in this country are capable of developing glitch-free software.And is it too much to ask that our tracers are given rigorous training before they take our lives in their hands WE welcome news that the Government will allow British National residents of Hong Kong to stay in Britain for a yearBeijing goes ahead with its proposed new sanctions on anti-government protests.When the UK handed Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing promised “one country, two systems” with genuine democracy. But these promises were broken long ago. Now, pro-democracy, anti-Beijing protesters are openly manhandled by police on the streets of the city.It is absolutely right that we give these British passport-holders sanctuary.Welcoming them will prove that post-Brexit Britain is a truly global country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But here’s the thing. A public inquiry shouldn’t waste its time working out who’s to blame. Because we already know that. It was the Chinese halfwit who kept his raw pork chops in a shed full of bats.No, the whole point of a public inquiry is to make sure that when the next pandemic comes along, we are better prepared to deal with it.And we don’t need a  of buffoons and buffoonesses to work that out, because we already know.We look at what the Germans did. And do that.On the first day back, he turned up to find that nothing had arrived.Not a single thing. Except, bang on the dot of am, a truck pulled on to the site, with the windows from Germany.FOR the past few weeks I’ve had a minor ear infection. I’ve spoken about it often. And being a man, moaned about it even more.I’ve even bought drops from the chemist, and then moaned about how they weren’t working.And now, weirdly, every time I go online I’m faced with an endless barrage of revolting adverts and photographs showing me how to get wax out of a clogged lughole.Much the same thing happened recently when I googled shipping containers and how they could be converted into garden offices.For the next month I got bombarded with shots of big metal boxes. Is my laptop listening to what I say  I can only presume it is.Well that’s fine. If it knows what subjects are erting me at any given moment, I’d like to express an interest this morning in what Abbey Clancy would look like in a swimsuit, on a yacht.Better, I should imagine, than someone pulling gunk out of their ear while sitting in a shipping container.DOMINIC Cummings was doing very well with his garden-based chat this week.His shirt was tucked in, he wasn’t rude or dismissive – and when he explained why he’d taken his we and young son to Durham, it made perfect sense to me.He was winning. But then came the question about why he’d subsequently gone to Barnard Castle and enjoyed a walk in the woods.Now. The correct answer would have been. “Yup. My bad. The kid was going stir-crazy in the house. Stupid I know, given that I helped write the stay-at-home rules but there you go. We all make mistakes. Soz.”I’d have bought that and we could have moved on.But instead he came up with a ridiculous story about going for a drive to test his eyesight and, all of a sudden, the man became a laughing stock.This was right up there with Ron Davies MP, who said he’d been on Clapham Common late at night because he was, er, looking at badgers.So now the Left is howling for Dominic’s blood and throwing eggs at his car and camping outside his house with their beards and their vegetarian shoes.Finally, they’ve got the architect of Brexit and they’re going to bring him down.Hmmm. So where were they when Alastair Campbell – another unelected government official – sexed up the document about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction That’s what we need to remember. He took us to war. Whereas all Dominic did was take his kid for a walk.Oh, and to be clear. I voted Remain.APOLLO  laid to rest any notion that space travel is particularly dficult.Because those three guys were up there in a leaking ship that had been smashed by an explosion, with less computing power than you’ve got in your iPhone and less electrical power than it takes to run a toaster.When they made it back to Earth safely, it proved you could probably go to the moon in a cement mixer.That being said, I am looking forward to the rescheduled launch of Elon Musk’s Space X mission.Not because it’s the first manned craft to take off from American soil for nine years, but because they’re going to use a rocket to get the astronauts into space.Then bring it back to earth and land it vertically on a ship, so it can be used again.If they can pull that one off, I will be VERY impressed.BOSSES at Thames Water are seeking a new home for a giant iron screw that’s twice the height of a giraffe and heavier than a hippopotamus.I was quite interested in using it as a garden ornament until I learned that the ft piece of ironmongery has been used for  years to deal with human effluent at a sewage plant in Hampshire.WE are coming to the end of the annual National Camping And Caravanning Week.Which this year, because of Covid-, was rebranded as the National Camping And Caravan Stay Home Week.Members were invited to spend the night at home or in their tents or caravans, and to then donate to the NHS the money they’d saved by not travelling. What a great idea, and let’s hope it was such a massive success that organisers decided to keep it going.Not just for one week of the year.

Two minutes and  seconds of this was after Mr Floyd was non-responsive.Floyd, a father-of-six, was filmed begging and gasping for air as police officers knelt on his neck while he was cuffed and on the ground during his May  arrest in Minneapolis.However, a preliminary autopsy did not find evidence of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation and found Floyd may have died from being restrained as well as from underlying health conditions.Floyds family has called in an independent forensic pathologist, Dr Michael Baden, to conduct his own autopsy, calling the official report an illusion.On Friday, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman highlighted the extraordinary speed in charging the case just four days after Floyd died but also defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner.He previously said: “My job in the end is to prove that he violated criminal statute, and there is other evidence that does not support a criminal charge.We need to wade through all of that evidence to come to a meaningful determination.”According to the criminal complaint, police were called after Floyd was suspected of passing a fake  bill at the Cup Foods store, the Star Tribune reported.Officers Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng approached Floyd, who was in a car with two other people.Lane pointed his gun at Floyd, who placed his hands on the steering wheel. Lane ed his gun to the holster and pulled him out of the car.Floyd initially resisted being handcuffed, but once cuffed was compliant. When they tried to put Floyd in the squad car, he stfened and fell to the ground and said he was claustrophobic.Chauvin then arrived with his partner, Tou Thao, and the four officers struggled to place Floyd in the squad car.Chauvin then pulled Floyd out of the vehicle, and the -foot- Floyd again went to the ground while still handcuffed, the complaint read.As two officers held Floyd’s back and legs, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck, the charges continued.Floyd then began repeating “I can’t breathe” along with “Mama” and “please,” the charges read.One or more of the officers said to Floyd, “You are talking fine” as he continued moving back and forth.None of the three officers moved from their positions, according to the complaint. Lane asked whether they should roll Floyd on his side.“No, staying put where we got him,” Chauvin allegedly replied.“I am worried about excited delirium or whatever,” Lane said.“That’s why we have him on his stomach,” Chauvin said.The three officers continued to hold Floyd down.“Excited delirium” is a controversial condition, often related to drug use, that can allegedly lead to violence or physical agitation, according to The Star.Thao can be seen in the video standing watch as Chauvin knelt on Floyd’s neck.Thao also rebuffed bystanders who begged the officers to relent and to check Floyd’s pulse after he went limp.Paramedics and emergency room staff at HCMC worked for nearly an hour to revive Floyd, who arrived with no pulse. He was pronounced dead around . pm.Freeman declined to say whether any of the former officers have given a statement to investigators.Freeman later issued a statement clarying “that it is critical to review all the evidence because at the time of trial, iniably, all that information will be used.”Chauvin’s attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment about the allegations against his client, who remains jailed with his first court appearance yet to be scheduled.The tragedy has rocked the US as protests have been ongoing for four days, with the army on standby.Chauvin faces up to  years in prisonconvicted - a  year maximum sentence for murder and a  year maximum sentence for manslaughter.Do you have a story for The US Sun team Email us at exclusive@the-sun or call   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Too nasty. Too partisan. Because it wasn’t really about a family fleeing to Durham, was it The row was about Brexit. And that row has changed the BBC forever.The current generation of BBC hacks will NEVER get over Brexit, and they find it impossible to hide their fury, contempt and anguish.For those of us who grew up with the BBC and who have loved the BBC for a letime, seeing the corporation sink so low is a national tragedy.Through the ages, the best BBC broadcasters — Andrew Neil, Jeremy Paxman, Robin Day, anyone called Dimbleby — parked their ego at the entrance to Broadcasting House.These BBC legends gave everyone a kicking.They were never vain enough to believe they spoke for the nation.Coming off the back of her interview with Prince Andrew, Maitlis is ridiculously puffed-up with a sense of her own importance.But nobody caresyou don’t like Brexit, Emily.Nobody cares that you — an investment banker’s we! — hate Leavers.Of course you do! But your opinions do not matter a damn.What really matters is that the British public are still obliged to subsidise your left-wing megaphone — so boring, so banal, so predictable — when you should be taking your chances in the open marketplace.Labour MP David Lammy, that intellectual giant, called the Maitlis rant, “public service broadcasting”, and it went down a storm with all the moaning, middle class minnies who pine for Brussels like a lost first boyfriend.But even the BBC could see Newsnight’s trolling of Cummings had gone a tad too far, the corporation offering a half-hearted apology, pretending Maitlis’ mad tirade was a “summary of the questions we would examine” rather than — heaven forbid! — the sneering presenter’s own point of view.Andyou believe those weasel words from this distrusted news source, then you will believe anything.Emily Maitlis spoke of “a deep national disquiet” on Newsnight.Oh, Emily — once again you have captured the mood of our nation!There is a deep national disquiet that the BBC still pockets £billion per annum from a public they openly detest.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Britt Ekland mourns the passing of the Bond girl.Britt, who played Mary Goodnight in The Man With The Golden Gun, talks asa love interest is a thing of the past in the  films.“I’m the proudest Bond girl in the world because there are not a lot of us left and there won’t be any in the future,” she said.“The Bond girl has to look good in a bikini. That was her role.“The Bond girl of my era exists no more because they’re not presented that way.“You wouldn’t see her in a bikini next to Daniel Craig today.”Britt is right that the Bond franchise gets embarrassed about the term “Bond girl” in our woke modern world.But the Bond girl – eventhey don’t call her that – still exists.The next Bond film, No Time To Die, features Lea Seydoux, Lashana Lynch, Naomie Harris and Ana de Armas –  has never been so surrounded by so many stunning women as he is in .The Bond franchise is not as PC as it wants to be.And the Bond films of the past are not quite as racy as we remember.When I see pictures of Britt Ekland as Mary Goodnight, I am shocked at the modesty of her white bikini.The last time I saw pants that big, Hugh Grant was trying to remove them from Bridget Jones.The Premier League is back on June .Cinemas start opening in July.

Oxford University research says that the morbidly obese are three times more likely to die of the virus.Twenty five per cent of all UK coronavirus fatalities had diabetes – a condition linked to obesity.We can all protect ourselves from a second wave by not being overweight.Japan is in many ways very similar to the UK – a densely populated nation with an ageing population.But it does not have an obesity problem and less than  people have died of Covid- there.But in the UK, one in three of us is now overweight and we have over , deaths.If Boris, above, could get this country to slim down it would save lives and take untold pressure off the NHS, which must manage the multiple side effects of obesity such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer.As we reflect on our nation’s tragic death toll, thank God we have a PM who is ready to say what no previous Prime Minister would have had the nerve to say – being fat can kill you.As for Boris, he is looking healthier already.And had my tiny mind changed forever.The Last Night Of The Proms will be broadcast live at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday, September .The planners say that the night will be “to bring the nation together” after the trauma of coronavirus.Onlythere is no audience!The Last Night Of The Proms features the most patriotic music ever made – Land Of Hope And Glory, Jerusalem, Rule Britannia – but the audience is stuffed with Remoaners waving their little EU flags.Nothing reveals the isions that exist in this country quite like Last Night Of The Proms.I HAD never really appreciated the extent of Cardi B’s tattoos until she posed on a pool lounger during lockdown.Who knew Interflora did body art Heidi Klum kissed a pig on America’s Got Talent – and he liked it.You might have expected Heidi to place a chaste smacker on the animal’s cheek but the kiss was on the side of mouth.No wonder the porker was practically purring.I don’t think I have ever seen a pig looking quite that happy since the last time Peppa Pig and her brother George encountered some muddy puddles. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its much smaller, but its a capsule. Its state of the art from a technology standpoint.Human spaceflights are far riskier than cargo-only trips, so weather conditions need to be perfect.Clear skies and low winds are optimal for a successful launch – and even an emergency mission abort requires good weather for a safe splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean.Nasa keeps track of more than  locations across the ocean to ensure a splashdown can be safely performed.Two astronauts, Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, will be making the trip to the International Space Station .They face an extended stay at the space station, according to NasaThe specic duration of the mission is to be determined.Both Behnken, , and Hurley, , have undergone extensive training ahead of the historic mission and have plenty of spaceflight experience.Born in St. Anne, Missouri, Behnken previously worked for the US Air Force before joining Nasa.Behnken will be the joint operations commander for the mission, responsible for activities such as rendezvous, docking and undocking, as well as Demo- activities while the spacecraft is docked to the space station, Nasa said.He was selected as a NASA astronaut in  and has completed two space shuttle flights.Fellow crewman Hurley was born in New York and was previously a fighter pilot for the US Marine Corps.According to Nasa, Hurley will be the spacecraft commander for Demo-, responsible for activities such as launch, landing and recovery,He was selected as an astronaut in  and has completed two spaceflights.The US space agency last fired one of its own astronauts into space in .Nasa retired its astronaut-carrying space shuttles that year to make way for a new space exploration program aimed at sending man to asteroids and other deep-space targets.However, multiple delays to its development schedule have left the space agency without a way to carry out manned space flights for years.Nasa hopes to fill the gap with spacecraft launched by private companies such as SpaceX, owned by Musk, and Blue Origin, run by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos.SpaceX has carried out dozens of successful safety tests but recent setbacks have caught the ire of Nasa boss Jim Bridenstine.Specically, he lambasted SpaceX for setting unrealistic timelines for the development of its space technologies.The Crew Dragon capsule was due to launch astronauts for the first time last year but the flight was pushed back after a safety test resulted in an unmanned capsule exploding in April . No one was killed in the blast but the incident delayed the crafts launch schedule by more than  months.Bridenstine recently held a joint conference with Musk after maligning the company on Twitter.I have been focused on ing to realism when it comes to costs and schedules, said the Nasa Administrator.So I was signalling - and I havent done it just to SpaceX but to all of our contractors - that we need more realism built into the development timelines.SpaceX is a cash-flushed rocket company that wants to take man to Mars.It was set up by eccentric billionaire Elon Musk in  and is based in Hawthorne, Calornia.SpaceXs first aim was to build rockets that could autonomously land back on Earth and be re-used.Musk hoped the technology would make flying and operating space flights far cheaper.SpaceX currently uses its reusable rockets to fly cargo to the International Space Station for Nasa.It also carries satellites and other space tech into orbit for ious international governments and companies.The company will take astronauts up to the ISS for the first time in .Other future missions involve carrying tourists and astronauts to the Moon.Musk has repeatedly said he believes humanity must colonise Mars to save itself from extinction.He plans to get a SpaceX rocket to the Red Planet sometime in the s. In other news, a tropical storm grounded a key SpaceX launch twice last week.Nasa recently unveiled the Tesla car that will be ferrying astronauts to tonights historic launch.And, incredible photos of eerie Martian landscapes have been released online by scientists.Are you excited for the SpaceX launch  Let us know in the comments!Do you have a story for The US Sun team Email us at exclusive@the-sun or call   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is an incredible achievement.”But five scientic advisers are still warning it is too risky to ease the lockdown.The experts, all members of the Scientic Advisory Group on Emergencies, warned the infection rate was too high.Prof Van-Tam said the rate will only stay below onepeople continue to adhere to physical distancing and play their part in making the contact tracing system a success. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The system aims to find out how and where coronavirus is spreading by testing people with symptoms. Experts have identied  ­possible symptoms but only those with one out of three are to be tested. These are a fever, cough or loss of taste or smell – which chief medical officer Chris Whitty says covers “ per cent” of cases. But other medics have rubbished his claim ­because those with other ­widely reported symptoms such as tiredness will miss out. It means many could have the virus without knowing and pass it on. Boris Johnson has also come under fire for saying he thought the list of symptoms was bigger than it was.Asked about it in a TV briefing on Thursday, a clearly confused PM replied: “I thought we were listing more, but anyway...” GP Nick Summerton called Mr Johnson’s failure “bewildering” and the Government’s approach as “haphazard and amateur”. And he said of Professor Whitty’s claim: “It is nonsense. He’s just made it up, basically. I don’t know what evidence he was using. “Chris Whitty was trying to make out that the public couldn’t keep more than three ­symptoms in their mind. “There is an ­arrogance among senior politicians and their advisers that is dangerous.We really don’t want a second peak but there is a real risk of thiswe build tracing ­contacts on poor foundations.”The test and trace system launched last week but has been delayed amid problems recruiting , contact tracers and technical issues with the app. Dr Summerton, who consulted on the app in April and takes calls from hundreds of people with Covid symptoms every day, claimed the policy has been rushed out too quickly and failure to widen the symptoms list risked missing up to  per cent of cases. He went on: “There were three things they ­needed to do before rolling this out: get testing ramped up – testing fewer than , a day is inexcusable now.If I was in that position, I would resign. I’d be embarrassed I hadn’t done the job I was employed to do. “They need to widen the ­symptoms they’re listing. And they need a way of dealing with people who have a  negative result.About a third who are tested are told they haven’t got coronavirus when they actually have.“Track and trace is becoming a shambles, just like testing has been a shambles. The whole thing is an embarrassment. It’s a disgrace.” Dr Sarah Jarvis, a GP of  years and clinical director of Patientaccess, said: “We have to look at the most common symptoms.Among the ­patients I’ve seen who ended up testing positive, profound tiredness and ­muscle ache has been common. “It would be worth considering adding sudden aches and pains to the list.” Dr Jarvis is concerned about the effectiveness of test and trace in the wake of Dominic Cummings breaking lockdown to drive to Durham while having symptoms.  She said: “One of the real issues is whether people will do what they are askedthey are told they have to self-isolate. “Matt Hancock standing up and saying it’s your civic duty when in the previous breath he had defended Dominic Cummings is hypocrisy. “I think the trust of the British ­people and their ability to act on behalf of the greater good has been severely eroded in the last week.” Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners and a London GP for  years, said: “The problem is, in the early days of the pandemic a policy was ­devised around patients in hospitals.That’s why there was such a narrow definition around coughs and fevers.  “We have to think more broadly about the dferent ways in which it presents.” Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “A test, trace isolate regime is crucial to safe easing of lockdown but Boris Johnson doesn’t seem to understand how the system is going to work. “After a week in which he has ­undermined pubic health messaging by standing up for Dominic Cummings, it’s vital government explain fully how test and trace will work.” "},{"url":null,"title":"labour mp resigns frontbench after","story":"NewsLabour MP resigns from frontbench after breaching lockdown with married loverCanterbury MP Rosie Duffield has quit her role as Labour whip after admitting to breaking coronavirus lockdown rules and meeting her married partner for a \"long walk\"ShareByAnna MacSwan:,  MAY NewsMP Rosie Duffield says she was navigating a dficult personal situation\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Because now that checking your eyesight is an acceptable reason for driving  miles, the rules for every-thing are dferent. To start withyou tell an optician you can only see six feet ahead of you, and even that is blurred and completely purple, you will no longer be tested with an old-fashioned eye chart. Instead they will ask you to drive a tractor to a well-known beauty spot. Then they will diagnose a weakened retina, because you caused a multi-car pile-up by ploughing through the central reservation on the M by Stafford services. Arsonists can say: “Hello officer. I needed to seeI was colour blind, so I set fire to the church to check I could distinguish the bright orange of the flames pouring from the roof from the musty grey of the smoke drting across the town. “The good news is my eyes seem to be in good working order. Bye for now.” This should also revolutionise the way drink-drivers are dealt with. From now on the police won’t have to muck about with cumbersome breathalysers. Instead,the police suspect a driver may be completely drunk they will ask them to drive  miles – making sure that before they set off they’ve put a small child on the back seat. Because of Dominic Cummings, now you can break any rule you’ve given to othersyou say: “I used my discretion.” If Dominic was an air steward his safety announcement would go: “In the event of an emergency, calmly follow the arrows towards the exit door. Don’t run or collect your belongings because this will obstruct me, and I’ll be running and collecting my belongings and pushing everyone  out of the way, possibly into the smoke pouring in from the engines. But don’t worry, I’ll be using my discretion.” If he’d been a warden in the Second World War he’d have said: “It is essential we maintain a total blackout following an air raid siren. “But it was all right for me to turn on floodlights across the garden all night and play a game of five-a-side football, because I was using my discretion.” The other catchphrase the Government seems keen on is “we have to move on”.  This is fine, as long as everyone is allowed to do this when they’ve been caught breaking rules too. The next time a bank robber is in court he should say: “We can argue all day about who aimed a sawn-off shotgun at who, but what the British people want now is for us all to move on.” "},{"url":null,"title":"petition calling dominic cummings sacked","story":"NewsPetition calling for Dominic Cummings to be sacked reaches ,, signaturesDominic Cummings travelled  miles to Durham with this four-year-old son and his we during lockdown - and now a Change.org petition is calling on him to be sackedShareCommentsByMirror:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsDominic Cummings said at a press conference on Monday he had not even considered resigning \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It only opened in December last year and staff were ramping up production on the new DBX when it had to close its doors. But with the majority of staff at the car plant now back at work, the company has followed Government guidelines on how toto work safely - as well as implementing its own initiatives. Remarkably, every employee is given THREE dferent facemasks on their first day back at work. .  Thataposs not part of government guidelines, says James Stephens, Director of Government and External Affairs at Aston Martin, but we think where there is a small chance of stopping additional spread of infection, we will issue all our staff with face masks. On day one, you are issued with three: one for the morning, one for the afternoon and one for the following morning. On day two you would put your mask on before you get out of your car.  The car giant is also implementing the new measures listed in the official government advice for firms. They have instigated one-way systems. There are two-metre spaces as staff queue up at the entrance to the plant. Hand sanitisers are provided at the door and throughout the building, and the canteen has adapted to only serve pre-packaged food.  People are also encouraged to check their temperature before they go to work and stay homethey have any symptoms of the virus. “Security and health and safety staff will take your temperature from a safe distance,” says James. If it’s high, staff are asked to sit aside before being retested. “Some people might cycle to work and might have a slightly elevated temperature for that reason.”The Government has issued advice for workplaces to reduce the risk of infection, including keeping staff in fixed teams, staying a safe distance apart and limiting face-to-face contact. Regular cleaning, increased hygiene and floor markings are also advised.  Walking, cycling or getting to work by car is ideal, butworkers have to use public transport they should travel off peak, use contactless payment, wear a face covering and maintain a -metre distance. Staff should also wash or sanitise their hands before and after commuting, as well as frequently throughout the working day. Before Covid- hit, Aston Martin encouraged staff to car share to reduce CO emissions, but they’ve had to pause this.

On Air Dining, which has served David Beckham pie and mash on a transatlantic flight, was ordered to give former ­executive Charles Robinson £,.

Mr Hulme also ­allegedly made a fake ­complaint to police that led to a raid on Mr Robinson’s house. Mr Robinson, who went to Sandhurst elite military academy, was diagnosed with PTSD after the ordeal. The tribunal heard he and his we separated ­temporarily because of the strain. The boardroom row was described as “malicious and vindictive” and Mr Hulme was criticised for a “total lack of remorse and no apology for the distress that these matters caused”.

Footage originally posted on Snapchat shows a person leaping from the clf and smashing into the sea at Durdle Door. Four people were injured - three of them seriously - jumping off the clfs and the beach had to be closed and evacuated shortly after for two air ambulances to land. Police said hitting water from that height can be critical and further compounded by tides. The force said this was not an appropriate location for this type of activity.A Facebook post by Poole Police said it was dealing with a critical incident and four people were injured as a result.It read: Emergency Services are trying to deal with the incident. We ask please that you avoid the area for the rest of the day. If you are currently at the location, please calmly make your way home so we can ensure effective service delivery. Hitting water from that height can be critical. This is further compounded by tides, currents and altering depth of the sea bed. It is not an appropriate location for this type of activity.  Images posted by Purbeck Police show two helicopters landing on the sand and crowds leaving the beach en masse as the area was evacuated. A post read: Please avoid Durdle Door as the beach is now CLOSED due to two helicopters having to land for two separate incidents. Expect high volumes of traffic as beach goers depart from the scene. HM Coastguard and the RNLI are helping to clear the area after police were called at around .pm. The first incident took place at around .pm with the emergency services rushing to the scene following a call from an eye-witness. He was lted off the sand and rushed  miles to Southampton General Hospital by air ambulance. The second man, who suffered his injuries at around .pm, received care at the scene and is believed to have broken his ankle. The nature of the third casualtyaposs injuries is not yet known. Chief Inspector Claire Phillips, of Dorset Police, said: We have had to close the beach at Durdle Door to allow air ambulances to land. As a result, we are evacuating the beach and the surrounding clf area.I am urging people to leave the area to enable emergency services to treat the injured people.Pictures taken earlier on Saturday showed the beach busy as the public were reminded to practise social distancing in the good weather following the relaxation of coronavirus lockdown restrictions.The footage has caused outrage on social media with people questioning why so many people were at the beach in the first place. Piers Morgan shared a picture of the scene. He said: The beach at Durdle Door, Dorset, today. Fools throwing themselves off the clfs into the seaair ambulances, s of people packed together like sardines. Total insanity.

And the artist who transformed the three-bedroom semi into a pink ­palace is pretty pleased, too. Rachael Havenhand, , is still trying to think of more ways to brighten up the house. She moved in six years ago and managed to contain her creative urges for two of those. Rachael, who lives with her two daughters, said: “I tried to be normal. I bought things in grey, white and other neutral colours but it just wasn’t me.” Using budget paint in shades of pink, purple and blue, she brightened up the walls.She also snapped up unloved furniture on eBay and bought rainbow-coloured throws and cushions from high street shops such as TK Maxx. Most of the artwork displayed on the walls was also created at home. Rachael, mum to Gabriella, nine, and Florence, five, said: “The girls absolutely love our home as it is like Barbie’s house – and their friends do, too.” Rachael’s striking ­kitchen floor is particularly ingenious. When she Googled s patterns for the floor, she found swirly lines and shapes and got to work. Creative Rachael said: “I put down white lino which cost about £, gave it a bit of a sand to give it some abrasion, then I went wild with ­masonry paint and some nish.  “I impulsively ­decided to do it one night and only finished at about am. I had prosecco to celebrate.” Over the years, the fireplace has been six dferent colours and she’s even painted her stereo. Rachael said: “I didn’t want to get rid of it because it’s really good, but it didn’t fit in. “I tried searching for a ­tutorial on YouTube but couldn’t find ­anything so I stuffed the CD drawers and insides with tissue and spray painted it purple. “Then I drew the buttons back on with a Sharpie.”Rachael, who has over , ­followers on Instagram, always decorates on a budget and often mixes paint together until she gets the colour she wants. Once, she ­accidentally bought silk paint instead of matt but a website suggested ­adding talcum powder to get the desired effect. “I thought, ‘Why not ’ It worked,” she said. Rachael admits she gets “bored easily” and would rather decorate than watch TV. “I need to be doing something ­creative,” she said. “My house may be wacky but it is normal to me. Even when it’s doom and gloom outside, it’s impossible to feel miserable in our house.”But not everyone is a fan.Rachael said: “I have received negative ­comments from people who ask how I don’t suffer with headaches but I don’t mind. It isn’t for everyone.“We love our home and that is all that matters.” Amazingly, Rachael doesn’t own the house, in Sheffield, but rents from a “very understanding” landlady.

Watching the way he puts people at ease within seconds of shaking their hands. Seeing him having a pint with Frank Lampard and bantering about the game. Hearing him joke about being short sighted and the police protection officer who ­persuades him to stop for “a cheeky Nando’s”. But the one that struck me most was when former player Marvin Sordell confessed he’d found parenthood dficult to come to terms with after growing up without a dad. William nodded, locked eyes with Martin, and told him he’d felt overwhelmed too as it brought back the trauma of his mother’s death. I’m sure that even die-hard republicans will have felt a rush of respect for the Duke of Cambridge in that moment. For it showed he has a talent – a vocation even – that has blossomed IN SPITE of his wealth and privilege, not because of it. William undoubtedly has his mother Diana’s warmth and human touch. He has her ability to connect with the public and the courage to show their vulnerability.  But the People’s Princess never really ­understood her own emotional fragility and sought out astrologers, healers and ­psychics when psychotherapists might have helped more. William has clearly “worked on himself” as the experts say, while he and we Kate have worked hard to educate themselves about the complex issues surrounding mental health. And so did his younger brother Harry, the vulnerable lad so clearly damaged by Diana’s tragic death. Let’s not forget all the great work William, Kate and Harry did with their Heads Together Campaign. But this documentary was yet another sad reminder of that broken brotherly bond. I wonderHarry will watch it as he and Meghan enjoy that “simpler” new le in a £million mansion in Beverly Hills.

And these stressful months are bringing out our very best and exposing the worst of our worst. This week, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey has been watching his city blow up with violent protests following the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded he couldn’t breathe while white police officers restrained him. After seeing Frey’s calm, ­considered reaction to President Trump, I knew he was made of the right kind of steel to lead his people through this crisis. Trump accused him of a “total lack of leadership” and being “very weak”, tweeting either he “get his act together and bring the city under control or I send in the National Guard and get the job done right”. Frey, in front of a packed press conference, calmly but passionately responded, pointing out that ­weakness is refusing to take ­responsibility for your own actions. It is pointing your finger at someone  in a time of crisis. And he apologised to the black community after footage of the disturbing death went viral. Police officers involved were sacked and one has been charged with murder. He had failed in “the most basic human sense,” Frey said. We need leaders like that, ones who are honest and can face uncomfortable truths so we can then trust their decisions.  We need strength – but that does not mean being arrogant or ­condescending. And Frey is an example of a leader for this new world, just like New Zealand’s PM Jacinda Ardern. She has not been afraid to show emotion and admit when things have gone wrong. I remember her crying while publicly apologising to the family of Grace Millane, the -year-old Essex woman who was murdered ­on holiday in Auckland. Like Frey, she understands her community, she is calm but strong, ­empathetic yet firm, strong yet approachable and relatable. She shows compassion. I wish I could say we were in the hands of great, strong leaders.  But the double act of Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings this week has shown exactly what we’re lumped with – a weak pair, who are completely out of touch. The lack of an apology is what I can’t let go of. Cummings has insulted us with his actions and that deserves a basic sorry at the very least – and the PM to acknowledge the mess.

Prime Minister Boris Jonson praised the resilience of extremely vulnerable shielders from coronavirus as lockdown measures are set to be eased for them from Monday. The . million clinically extremely vulnerable people will be able to go outside with members of their household from Monday, but must continue to follow social distancing guidelines. Those who live alone can meet outside with one other person from another household. Reviews of the shielding guidance are expected to be made at regular points in the coming weeks. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here   Mr Johnson said: I want to thank everyone who has followed the shielding guidance - it is because of your patience and sacrice that thousands of lives have been saved. I do not underestimate just how dficult it has been for you, staying at home for the last  weeks, and I want to pay tribute to your resilience. I also want to recognise the hundreds of thousands of extraordinary volunteers who have supported you in shielding. Whether through delivering medicines and shopping, or simply by checking in on those isolating, they should feel deeply proud of the part they have played in this collective effort. We have been looking at how we can make le easier for our most vulnerable, so today I am happy to confirm that those who are shielding will be able to spend time outside with someone , observing social distance guidelines. I will do what I can, in line with the scientic advice, to continue making le easier for you over the coming weeks and months.  Communities Secretary Jenrick will say: Those shielding from coronavirus have made huge sacrices over recent months to protect both themselves and the NHS - they deserve our thanks and our support for their efforts. Incidence rates of coronavirus are now signicantly lower than before these measures were put in place. Thataposs why we are focused on finding the right balance between continuing to protect those at the greatest clinical risk, whilst easing restrictions on their daily lives to make the dficult situation more bearable - particularly enabling the contact with loved ones they and we all seek. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: I want to take this opportunity to thank the NHS, GPs, all those who volunteered, community pharmacists and all those involved in providing much-needed support and guidance for patients required to shield over the past  weeks. Thanks to the sacrices made across the country, which have protected the NHS and saved lives, itaposs now time to begin lting restrictions, step by step, and while we must all stay alert, we can now start to resume a sense of normality. Steven McIntosh, director of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: This is a step forward for people who are most vulnerable to coronavirus, a group who have felt left behind and forgotten as lockdown eases. The Government has listened and it is good news that they are now regularly reviewing guidance for this aposshieldedapos group and will have written to those affected by mid-June. For many, itaposll be welcome advice that they can now choose to go outside for exercise or to meet people whilst socially distancing. But they still face heavy restrictions like being advised to avoid food shopping, going to pharmacies or their workplaces.

Here he tells us what heaposs seen in a country at war with itself. Overwhelmed and woefully underprepared, America burned as at least  cities became engulfed in anger over the death of unarmed black man George Floyd by white cops. For months the country had been gripped by disease, mass unemployment and an apocalyptic economy but now outrage at the police is all that matters here. As I stood on the ravaged streets of Minneapolis in the early hours of Saturday morning with the thousands of demonstrators protesting Mr Floyd’s fatal arrest, it didn’t take long before their anger turned once again to violence.But they were no longer alone. From east to west coast deadly protests broke out nationwide forcing many states to declare emergencies. Two government private security officers were shot - one fatally - in Oakland, Calornia, while at least , demonstrators took to the city’s streets. In Detroit, a -year-old protester was shot dead by a group of men while police were seen violently throwing a -year-old woman to the ground in New York. Phoenix, Denver and Houston were all left vandalised as hundreds of people were arrested. Meanwhile the President Donald Trump gloated rioters were damaging the Atlantia headquarters of CNN - the news channel he despises.“In an ironic twist of fate, CNN HQ is being attacked by the very riots they promoted as noble and just. Oops,” he tweeted.It came just days after Twitter was forced to mark his tweets as “glorying violence” after he posted “when the looting starts, the shooting starts”.Fearing all-out war across America, Trump has instructed soldiers in North Carolina, New York, Colorado and Kansas be put on orders ready to move. It is the first time since the  LA riots such a call has been made.  The order came as the Secret Service was confronted for five hours by demonstrators at the White House as Trump sat inside. Today he tweeted the protesters “would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen,” had they breached the fence.Despite a global pandemic killing more than , Americans while leaving  million unemployed in its wake, people in the States now have greater concerns on their minds than the coronavirus.While they fight to be heard, Trump instead wages his war against Twitter, postal voting in the upcoming election all while encouraging looters to be shot. America’s persistent political dys and racial inequality have been laid bare since last week - a reminder of how black people are killed by law enforcement in disproportionately high numbers.It is a nation in crisis - one seared by violence against its people, plagued by a deadly disease that remains uncontrolled all while reeling by a devastating blow to its economy. None more so than in Minneapolis - a melting pot of immigrants maligned by Trump and his administration. A walk down burning Lake Street shows the contempt felt for the US leader whose has served only to fan the flames of the unrest that now plagues the country. “F*** Trump,” can be seen hundreds,not thousands of times sprayed on to burnt out and looted businesses. The charging on Friday of now ex-cop Derek Chauvin with the murder of Mr Floyd, , did little to quell the anger. The criminal complaint against him only fuelled the violence more after it told how the officer’s knee had been on the father-of-two’s neck for eight minutes and  seconds. For two minutes and  seconds of that Mr Floyd was unresponsive.  Fearing a fourth night of violence on Friday, city leaders put in place an pm curfew, but in a show of furious and violent contempt, defiant rioters rampaged across Minneapolis. It led to unprecedented havoc as they set billowing fires, looted and vandalised businesses all while shot at police officers, who finally emerged from the shadows with rubber bullets and tear gas. As the curfew drew close, I stood by the now destroyed Third Police Precinct, the station once the base of Chauvin and the three others officers - all of whom have now been fired - involved in Mr Floyd’s fatal arrest. I watched through my tear-gassed streaming eyes the National Guard joined hundreds of militarised police as loudspeaker announcements were made telling the crowds to disperse. But no one listened. Instead, over the next three hours, the demonstrators slowly walked forward for several miles before not one cop was left in sight.It was clear authorities had underestimated size and tactics of protestors who as the night wore on were replaced by hundreds of rioters. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz later said: “This is the largest concentration of law enforcement in the history of Minnesota. And it’s not enough.” He said the destruction was “le-threatening, dangerous to the most well-qualied forces facing this,” telling rioters “You need to go home, you need to go home. Our neighbours are afraid.” But no one cared. One of those present, Karis Jameel, , told me: “If they could tell me what  I could do,they could tell me a better way to change America and ends it police brutality, then I will leave the streets. “But they have no answers. The only time we are ever listened to is when cities burn, and they are burning now all over America.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mans attempt reheat food packed","story":"NewsMans attempt to reheat food on packed flight leaves passengers baffledA man who took a slice of pizza on a plane with him pulled it out during the journey for a tasty snack - but his efforts to reheat the meal left other passengers very confusedShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  MAY NewsThe picture was shared by the Passenger Shaming Instagram page \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Having pizza on board is nothing but a distant dream for most of us, but one passenger who clearly prepared in advance appears to have saved a slice as a mid-journey snack. At first it seems like a genius move - until you see a picture which has been shared on social media of how he prepared his meal. Rather than eating it cold - which seems like the logical choice considering he was on and aeroplane - he decided that it would taste better warm. Asking the crew for help to heat it up was a long shot he wasnapost willing to take, so instead he turned on the overhead light above his seat and held the slice millimetres from the bulb in the hope it would cook.The moment was captured by a fellow passenger sitting in a row behind and shared by the Passenger Shaming Instagram account with the caption: Just warming up some leftovers.It racked up more than , likes as others were left ided by his cooking technique.

I feel surprised and indignant, given that at a moment of national mourning for so many dead, an incident of this type stands out, he said. Itaposs completely irresponsible, because that number of people multiplied could cause an outbreak, and that would mean that Córdoba, after passing to Phase , would have to take a step back. That is unforgivable. The police are investigating not just the observance of confinement measures, but also the breaking of other rules, given that we are still under a state of alarm.

What happens then Will we see the ‘cans’ come together to form their own league temporarily and leave the ‘cannots’ to their mothballs We’ve all railed at the self-interest that has forever governed the SPFL – this all seems a more reasonable discussion but one that could, evenonly temporarily, see some clubs leave others behind in the dust.GORDON Strachan fairly rattled a few cages with his views at the start of the week.The Dundee technical director takes exception to some clubs in the lower leagues surviving for survival’s sake.From a man who has played and managed at the highest level, he’s certainly one whose views should be taken into account.He called for more professionalism throughout the leagues and to get away from the part-time mentality.I agree.But there is also an assumption there that being part-time is somehow a choice for clubs in the lower isions.These teams have to scrap for every penny so they can try to be competitive on the pitch. Cash isn’t exactly flowing, even in the Championship.On the former Scotland manager’s opinion that we don’t sell our game nearly as well as we should, I wholeheartedly agree.We hold ourselves back as a group by thinking only about ourselves – change that and the money will filter down the leagues and, hopefully, bring more professionalism.CLUBS across the country are releasing their players.It’s normal for the profession at this time of year but this time is dferent – players now can’t find new employment.Dundee, as well as Falkirk and Ayr, should be applauded for resisting the urge to cut costs by granting the players at least a few weeks more pay.When you see a club like Dunfermline release  players, it puts it into perspective.I don’t think  will be the highest number we see either.I was disappointed to hear my team Queen of the South release almost their entire squad.Pretty much only Stephen Dobbie and Kevin Holt remain.It’s a business decision but there is also a human aspect of looking after your staff.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

enjoying sizzling temperatures as it was the hottest day in Scotland this year.The mercury hit  C in  Aboyne, and today is set to be another dry day in Aberdeen with some long spells of sunshine.Demand for golf slots was so great Sport Aberdeen#s online booking system crashed earlier this week, and hundreds of names are on a reserve list in case of cancellations.Sport Aberdeen managing director Alistair Robertson said: #It#s been great to see so many golfers out, although the last few days have been mental with the number of people trying to book.#We have taken over , phone calls and we have got around , golfers booked in for the first four days, so there is a very busy weekend of golf ahead.#We have a fantastic team and I couldn#t be prouder of everyone who has mucked in because they are doing jobs they wouldn#t be normally. We have people on furlough and that makes it more challenging because we have a skeleton crew, but they have all done a really good job working from first thing in the morning until last thing at night.#As an organisation we want to get people out and active and it now feels more like normal. There have been lots of smiles and busy courses, and it#s really nice to see.#Golfers are well-used to etiquette and the way they should behave, and people have been very respectful.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world.

These allow vets to make the best diagnosis possible and give advice or treatment whichever is required.Medications and prescriptions can be collected from the Tranent surgery or posted or delivered via courier to clients.Reception staff are extremely busy as they have to determine which category the phone call falls into. There is no such thing as making a basic appointment now. Everything takes much longer to discuss and consequently sometimes the telephone system is overwhelmed.You can, of course, leave a message or send an email, contact websites or Facebook pages. Someone will respond to your question as soon as possible. The reception team are doing a wonderful job, as of course they are at all veterinary practices. They are our frontline heroes who deserve special applause.At Dunedin Vets, we are now seeing more emergency cases after triage.Dogs and cats who are now almost three months overdue their boosters can now have them. This will prevent them having to restart their vaccine course and means their owners only having to visit the practice once.All pups and kittens who had first vaccines before lockdown should have had their second vaccines now. Pups can start vaccine courses as long as they have been in their new home for at least one week, are over ten weeks old and their owners are not self- isolating.We are trying to delay kittensrsquo vaccinations as long as possible ndash especiallythey are not going out.We will try to do one vaccine at neutering time, to reduce the number of visits. If your rabbit is due boosters just now, as many rabbits are, prior to going outdoors, both vaccines can be given at the same time rather than two weeks apart ndash again reducing the number of outings to the surgery. Clients are not allowed in the surgery, having smaller animals in cages and dogs on leads helps in the handover of pets.I am sure all veterinary practices have been thinking about when we can have clients back in the surgery.At Dunedin Vets, we will have safety shields on reception desks and distancing stickers as well as hazard tape on the floor. Staff will be wearing masks and visors and there will be a limit to the numbers of clients allowed in the surgery at any one time.Hopefully we can open our other branches and have all our staff back at work soon. Until then we continue doing as we are doing and keeping everyone safe.During this period of lockdown there have been some ongoing cases which have required regular treatment, examinations and blood tests. These include diabetics, dogs with Addisonrsquos or Cushingrsquos conditions and cats with blood pressure and thyroid problems as well as those with heart conditions.One patient who had to be seen throughout this time is Buri.Buri is a four-year-old German Shepherd dog belonging to Mrs Sarah McHale and family who visit our Dunbar surgery.In November , Buri was seen at Dunbar with an apparent urinary tract infection. He had been drinking more and going to the toilet lots. When examined, he was a fit, lively dog, but had several large lymph nodes under his neck.Rhiannon the vet took a sample from the glands which I examined under the microscope. I found some large, unusual cells. Buri came for a biopsy under anaesthetic.The samples were sent to a laboratory for testing and unfortunately the results were not good. Buri had lymphoma, a cancer of blood cells which results in enlargement of lymph nodes. This is a form of cancer which we can treat in practice with chemotherapy.The particular type of lymphoma Buri had would respond better to a drug he needed to have at Edinburgh Vet School. So for the next five months, every week Buri attended either our Tranent branch for one type of chemotherapy and sometimes to the Vet School at Penicuik for the other.He had to take tablets every day as well. He had numerous blood tests to check his blood count and to check all his organs were ing well. He also had urine samples checked to make sure no problem was developing.He was such a good lad. He had to be away from his family when the chemotherapy was being administered.Vet Jonny and nurse Fiona, dressed in their chemotherapy PPE, became his best friends. He seemed to love coming to the surgery bouncing about and wanting to play with everyone.He responded very well to his treatment. His lymph nodes reduced rapidly. He remained happy and healthy, eating well and had very few side effects from the chemotherapy. The weeks wore on and Buri became a regular at the surgery, usually on a Tuesday afternoon, when all the staff looked out for him.When lockdown came, we received a message from the Vet School that they were unable to carry out further chemotherapy treatments.Buri was at the end of his treatment there.We continued to give him his chemotherapy for three more weeks, when on April , he received his very last dose.He was still the happy boy we adored. We decided to ring that final chemo bell and give him a round of applause which he justly deserved.His mum had to stay at home self- isolating but we shared a video and photos with her, which she loved.She was happy for us to spread the good news and our Facebook video post went viral.No doubt Buri will have ups and downs and may require further treatment but we wish Buri and his family every good wish for the future.Stay safe everyone."},{"url":null,"title":"cinema-chains-planning-reopen-july","story":"Companies including Cineworld, Odeon, Showcase Cinemasand Vue are among many preparing behind the scenes to reopen their doors to movie fans across England, Scotland and Wales in time for a string of summer blockbusters.Here is what you need to know.What are Cineworld doing Cineworld hopes to start showing films in all its cinemas in July.Bosses said that its cinemas up and down the country would open when restrictions are lted.ldquoCineworld currently anticipates that Government restrictions related to cinemas will be lted in each of its territories by July.

The firrst houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.ldquoI also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido, space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar development in modular manufacture and construction.The council is launching an eight-week consultation on their vision for the area from tomorrow and people will be able to go in and give their views.They are also hoping that as lockdown restrictions ease they may be able to have outdoor exhibitions for people who cannot access the proposals online and will be advertising the consultation locally so people can get in touch through the post.The Scottish Government is currently looking at revising its framework and the council has made its case for the wider area to be classed as a National Development, which will give their proposals support at a national level.The consultation will open at https:eastlothianconsultations  from Monday, June ."},{"url":null,"title":"council-says-soon-open-car-parks-playparks","story":"And with more great weather predicted on Saturday and Sunday, the streets and laybys nearest to our beaches are expected to again become congested andcome under more stress from vehicles this weekend.East Lothian Council has said its coastal and country car parks will remain shut during the early stages of lockdown easing as the Scottish Government urged people to stay local.However, the decision did not deter sunseekersfrom driving to the beaches on Friday with somecars parked irresponsibly and some on yellow lines on the roads outside the beauty spots, as our pictures show.A council spokesperson urged people to respect the advicefor people to still stay at home as much as possible and warned fines would be issuednecessary.Parking attendants were being sentto the busiest spots to start ticketing motorists who had ignored the parking restrictions.The council spokesperson said: \"Itrsquos important that we all continue to follow the really important national advice, including physical distancing and staying close to home.\"The First Minister has advised that car parks which have been closed should stay closed at this time.\"Our decision was taken to protect local communities living by these destinations and with full support of Police Scotland.

Wherever the coronavirus has achieved signicant infection rates, grim death rates in care homes have followed, often accounting for  per cent or more of total deaths. On cursory examination England currently appears to be exhibiting a lower rate but when \"excess deaths\" are fully accounted the rate there will not only likely be comparable, as indicated by the recent LSE study, but the overall death rate per head of population looks like it may be the highest in Europe, and possibly the highest in the world, through this first phase of the pandemic.Jackson Carlaw and Richard Leonard have now both decided to point their political fingers at the Scottish Government for embarking on a UK-wide approach of accelerated early discharge from hospitals, especially of the elderly, at a time when hospitals were expected to be overwhelmed with Covid- patients . Following the advice of clinicians some were discharged into care homes subject to Government regulations and guidelines. Certainly at the time none of these politicians was disputing this logical action, but perhaps everyone has been naiumlve about the day-to-day ing of care homes, especially those governed by the aims of private investors. Staff moving in and out of care homes, many of which were not properly prepared for a pandemic and initially not fully supported by their management in the purchase of appropriate PPE, may have been the primary carriers of Covid- into these homes.How many were are in the unenviable position of effectively working under zero-hours-contracts with little or no income should they suspect they may have the virus and feel compelled to work on, especially in situations where residents in their care are already suffering because of reduced staffing numbers and the torture, for some, of isolation Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.I AM in complete agreement with David Stubley .

Waves were crashing over them. They quickly hoisted the sail, but it was shredded by the wind. Then the rudder broke.The small fishing boat began to drt. For the next eight days, the boys tried to catch fish and collect rainwater in the hollowed-out coconut shells. And then they saw an island, a ft-high mass sticking out of the sea. This was the uninhabited island of Ata. The boys managed to guide the boat to this unforgiving lump of rock in the middle of the Pacic Ocean. And then they had to work out how to survive.At which point we might think we know where this story goes. We have all read Lord of the Flies, or at least know the story about a group of schoolboys who end up on an uninhabited islandwho go wild, argue, ide, form opposing tribes, and who, ultimately, revert to savagery and eventually murder.ldquoMan produces evil as a bee produces honey, William Golding, the author of Lord of the Flies, would later suggest. In short, violence and destruction are in our nature. His  novel is therefore a chart map of the descent of man .Except that isnrsquot quite what happened on the island of Ata. On Sunday, September , , the Australian captain of a passing ship noticed burnt patches on the islandrsquos green clfs. Intrigued, he sailed closer and through binoculars he saw a naked boy who promptly jumped from the clfside and started to swim towards the ship. He came onboard and told the captain, ldquoMy name is Stephen. There are six of us.In their  months on the island, the six boys hadnrsquot reverted to savagery. Rather, they managed to start a fire and kept it alight for more than a year. They drew up a roster for garden, kitchen and guard duties. They worked out a solution to resolve arguments. They survived storms and lack of water. When the captain found the boys, they were all in perfect physical health.This story, a real story, is one of survival. But itrsquos also a story of co-operation, of boys working together, helping each other out, of finding a way through.Thatrsquos why Rutger Bregman retells it near the beginning of his new book, Humankind. Subtitled ldquoA Hopeful History, it is a book that sets out to challenge the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves, one that suggests we are not as selfish and self-interested as we are told we are, that posits that our instincts are primed for co-operation rather than competition, that argues for altruism, that believes in the concept of human kindness. ldquoItrsquos time for a new realism, he writes. ldquoItrsquos time for a new view of humankind.Rutger Bregman lives in Houten, ldquoa small place in the middle of the Netherlands, a very boring provincial town, he says, with his we and a growing reputation. His last book, Utopia for Realists, argued for a universal basic income and a shorter working week. Last year he addressed the World Economic Forum and told the global elite thatthey really wanted to address global inequalities, they could start by facing up to their tax avoidance. The real issue, he told them, was ldquotaxes, taxes, taxes, and all the rest is bullshit.Bregman is an articulate thirtysomething whose book is a challenge to many of our preconceived ideas about humanity. In a way, he suggests, our current pandemic crisis is a perfect illustration of one of the main themes of his book. Itrsquos the Ata story played out on a global scale.ldquoWhat we are seeing right now reminds me very much of this whole body of sociological research. Since the s, scientists have known that in a moment of crisis itrsquos not everyone for him or herself. Actually, people co-operate really well.ldquoBut, somehow, we forget this again and again. I was just reading about why Britain was so slow to go into lockdown and one of the reasons [given] was the public couldnrsquot handle it, that they would become tired of it. They underestimated the resilience of the public.ldquoThis reminded me of what happened before the Blitz because that was exactly the same situation. The military experts thought the British people would go nuts once the Germans started to bomb the population. But pretty much the opposite happened. The keep calm and carry on spirit.ldquoAnd then they thought, lsquoIt must be British culture. Wersquore so special.rsquo No, itrsquos human nature. Exactly the same thing happened when they started bombing the Germans.ldquoSomehow elites make this mistake again and again. They think, lsquoHow will people behave rsquo They look in the mirror, they see themselves, and they think, lsquoWhat would I do  Well, probably I would panic and act really selfishly. Thatrsquos how most people will behave.rsquoThe sort of thinking, in other words, that means you get in a car and drive to Durham during a lockdown.But that is not what most of us do, Bregman suggests. When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in August , killing  people, the media was electried by reports emerging from the Superdome where , people had sought shelter. Reports of gun shots, stories of roving gangs, of rape and murder. The chief of police stated that the city was descending into anarchy.Months later, it emerged that none of this was true. Six people had died in the Superdome, four from natural causes, one from an overdose and one poor soul committed suicide. The police chief had to admit there had been no official report of a single rape or murder. Instead, people came from as far away as Texas to help. ldquoCatastrophes, Bregman writes, ldquobring out the best in people.Itrsquos a theme he s to in our conversation. ldquoOn   we have extraordinary accounts of altruism while the towers were burning. You literally have people saying, lsquoyou go firstrsquo as they went down the stairs of the burning twin towers.At which point, you might be forgiven for simply saying, ldquolook around, mate.ldquoI think that we are not only one of the friendliest species in the animal kingdom, we are also clearly the cruellest, Bregman accepts. ldquoThere is no other species that I know of that likes to lock up groups of other people and then exterminates them. If you think about wars and ethnic cleansing and all the horrible things human beings are capable of hellip Irsquove never heard of a penguin that does that.ldquoI believe there is a real connection between our capacity for kindness and empathy and our most cruel behaviour, because so often we do these cruel things in the name of loyalty and comradeship and friendship.This is our Achilles heel, he says. We are co-operative and friendly, but only with those we recognise as being like us. Those who are presented to us as ldquoother are suspect. And once we see them as dferent, well, we know where that can lead ndash to concentration camps and the industrialisation of murder.Bregmanrsquos fascinating, very readable, broad-brush history ranges from our hunter-gatherer days to the present day. He examines the psychological experiments that have been used in support of veneer theory the infamous Stanford university prison experiment which saw the volunteers who were chosen as guards begin to torture the ldquoprisoners and Stanley Milgramrsquos Yale University experiment in which normal people were found to be willing to give an electric shock to people even though they knew it was causing pain. Both experiments , he suggests, were deeply flawed.He also examines the reality of conflict rather than the Hollywood recreation. In war, he points out, most soldiers never fire their weapons. After the Battles of Waterloo and the Somme there was little evidence of bayonet wounds among the dead. ldquoMost of these victims were victims of artillery, Bregman suggests, ldquobecause it is psychologically much easier to push a button and have an explosion far away.Even so, we must still negotiate the black horror of the Holocaust. ldquoI think there are a lot of mechanisms that we have to look at,\" he says. \"On the one hand this capacity we have for tribal behaviour and doing things in the name of loyalty. So, Wehrmacht soldiers kept on fighting, not because they were brainwashed or ideological fanatics, but because they were fighting for their friends.ldquoBut then itrsquos obviously not true for the fanatical SS Guards, right  So, you need a layered explanation for so many phenomena.Psychological distance is part of it, he says. ldquoThis whole process of dehumanisation where you look at other people and donrsquot see people but see animals, or things.ldquoThe social psychology experiments of the s tried to make the case that therersquos a Nazi in every one of us just below the surface. I think that totally trivialised the actual historical phenomenon of the Holocaust.ldquoThese things are possibilities, but they are at the end of a very long and dark road where evil becomes normalised and people become adjusted to things they should never become adjusted to and often destroy themselves in the process.ldquoBecause this is another thing we know that killing another person often kills something within yourself as well, which suggests to me that wersquore not born to do that.ldquoWe like sex because itrsquos good for us, we like food because itrsquos good for us, but with violence we know soldiers who kill someone  often come back with PTSD.For Bregman, then, humanity isnrsquot made of as many crooked timbers as we seem to think. And yet thatrsquos how we see ourselves. Why ldquoFirstly, you have to look at the systems of information we have and most of us consume daily news, and the news is mostly about things that go wrong. Itrsquos mostly about corruption and violence and terrorist attacks, etc. And we know from quite a bit of research that people who watch the news become more cynical and a bit more depressed. Therersquos even a term for it in psychology: they call it lsquomean world syndromersquo. I think that partly explains it.Secondly, he suggests, its deeply rooted in the culture, in the Christian idea of original sin, and in Enlightenment philosophy. ldquoAnd then you look at the current system we live in. You could call it the neo-liberal capitalist model. Well, whatrsquos the central dogma of that  Itrsquos that people are selfish, and we just have to deal with it, right ldquoThen the question is, who benefits from this  And I think the answer is that those in power benefit. The cynical view of human nature is a really important legitimisation of hierarchy, becausewe canrsquot trust each other, then we need hierarchy. We need people to keep us in check.ldquoButpeople are pretty decent, we can have a revolution to a much more egalitarian kind of society.Itrsquos maybe no surprise that Bregman is the son of a Protestant minister, though he himself is an atheist. ldquoSometimes I think religion can have terrible consequences, butyou meet my parents you will discover it can have pretty wonderful consequences and help people become better versions of themselves.ldquoAnd thatrsquos partly what this book is all about. Itrsquos about the performative power of ideas. Becausewe have this selfish view of human nature, we create a society that brings out the worst in us.ldquoIf we have a more hopeful view of human nature ndash and I think a big part of the New Testament is infused with this more hopeful view ndash then we can create a very dferent kind of society.How might that manest itself  Bregman makes a case for participatory democracy, which advocates more citizen participation and greater community political representation than traditional representative democracy. It is now in place in , cities around the world, including Porto Alegre in Brazil. And yet Brazil, of course, is currently led by an authoritarian leader in Jair Bolsonaro.ldquoI see lots of reasons for pessimism, agrees Bregman. ldquoEspeciallyyou live in the United States and Brazil. These lsquostrong menrsquo are doing such a terrible job. I also think itrsquos very visual and it grabs our attention, so we think this is the biggest story that is going on in the world. And the problem with participatory democracy is that itrsquos very calm and quiet. Many people wonrsquot have heard of it. Most journalists hate it because itrsquos really boring. Itrsquos just people sitting together around a table, whether theyrsquore left-wing or right-wing, young or old, and they have these sensible discussions while they drink tea. Itrsquos terrible reality television.But in the end, he is arguing that boring can be good. Andwe can believe in our goodness, we can improve things. There is a Dutch lay preacher in him somewhere.Bregman argues his ideas are tougher than they are sometimes portrayed. ldquoPeople think, lsquoOh, this guy has written this nice and happy, warm book about the power of kindness and how you should follow your intuition.rsquo Well, actually, Irsquom also arguing for the opposite. Irsquom also arguing how intuition can lead us astray.ldquoIf you follow your intuition you would never build a prison system like they have in Norway where they treat criminals with kindness. That is not what my intuition saysyou have a rapist or a murderer. But it is the most effective prison system in the world.ldquoAnd that goes back to the other point what it means to be a realist. I figure thatrsquos the central objective of the whole book. To redefine that.So often we say, lsquoOh, yoursquore too idealistic, yoursquore too hopeful, just be a realist. We equate realism with cynicism.ldquoWe need to move to a very dferent definition of what it means to be a realist.Humankind: A Hopeful History, by Rutger Bregman is published by Bloomsbury, priced pound."},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-prime-minister-kept-man-lost-authority","story":"Well, Dominic Cummings is invisible no more. The Prime Ministerrsquos chief adviser, crutch and Achillesrsquo heel this week became a household name. And other names.The immediate row over his breaking the lockdown appears to be fizzling out. By Thursday, it had come down to whether he ldquomight have breached regulations yet dodged a pound fine. You know a story is on its last legs when it reaches that level. People donrsquot quit over never-levied pound fines.But when you remember the big picture, the outrage comes roaring back. It is clear Mr Cummings should no longer be in his post.Not for breaching a regulation - though he did - but because he violated the very essence of the lockdown: self-denial for the greater good.Despite helping to craft and promote the Stay Home, Save Lives message, he broke faith with it and put self-interest above collective interest.While others selflessly resisted their instincts, he claimed following his had been a virtue. It was pure hypocrisy.He tells us he left London for Durham because he feared he and his we were getting sick with Covid and needed help looking after their four-year-old. In other words, he and his family might have faced hardship. Join the club, Dom. Itrsquos hardship all round.Sick parents cooped up with needy children are, sadly, all too common.It is not an exceptional experience or exceptional excuse. Mr Cummings may regard himself as exceptional, but that is a dferent matter.As for his yarn about a -mile round trip to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight, where to begin It was as believable as a giant coronavirus particle sitting in the Downing Street garden complaining it wasnrsquot harmful just misunderstood.This was no eye test, it was a jaunt to a beauty spot on his wersquos birthday.Mr Cummings could have edged solo round a few backroads or a deserted carpark to checkhe could drive back to London, but somehow he and his family ended up stretching their legs by a picturesque riverbank.Durham Constabulary didnrsquot find it credible, and nor did anyone .This week has seen the worst side of politics - tribe before country.Tory ministers have twisted, dissembled, debased themselves, and patronised and insulted the public to protect Mr Cummings and a PM who relies on him to an unhealthy degree.They have refused to acknowledge failings, brushed aside manest dishonesty, and even pretended A-roads are good spots for eye tests. They have treated voters like sheep.To cap it all, they had the gall to tell people to ldquodo the right thing as we move into the test and trace phase.To their credit, many Tory MPs and MSPs refused to join the sycophancy.But aside from Moray MP Douglas Ross, who quit as a Scotland Office minister, it looked like a government of creeps, without honour, without shame.The collapse in moral authority damages the health messages.When Matt Hancock chirpily urged people to do their civic duty, asnothing had happened, my immediate reaction was a disgusted ldquoscrew you.Irsquove since calmed down, but some will take the Cummings approach.Instead of the right thing, they will do the convenient one. Instead of living within the guidance, they will see how far they can stretch it, the war on the virus undermined by a sht towards spivvy rule-bending.Mr Johnson may be relieved this weekend to have kept his man in post, but the price for his premiership is enormous. He has antagonised both his party and the electorate.A few weeks ago, the country fretted when the PM lay at deathrsquos door. Now hersquos an object of derision, viewed as a weak leader in thrall to a smarter underling. Some turnaround.Setting Covid aside for a moment, this should in theory be the honeymoon for Mr Johnsonrsquos government. Less than six months since the election, it should still be enjoying broad support.Yet this week YouGov found  per cent of voters already disapprove of its record, against % who approve, and the Tory lead over Labour plunged from  points to six. The same pollsters also found % of people thought Mr Cummings should quit.Six months after his election in , Tony Blair also hit his first big scandal with the Bernie Ecclestone affair, a plain-as-day story about a poundm donation from the F boss and F coincidentally being exempted from a ban on tobacco advertising. Mr Blair insisted he was a ldquopretty straight sort of guy, but it always tainted him.Mr Johnson blithely absolving Mr Cummings is a similar turning point.But it is more dangerous. Mr Johnson has never enjoyed great public confidence. He won in December because of Jeremy Corbyn, Brexit fatigue, and by asking Labour voters to lend him their support.It was also going to be a tightrope to keep the public on side. But now he must walk it with a reputation for treating the rest of us with disdain.That will seep into every major reform in the years ahead, especially Brexit given Mr Cummingsrsquos pivotal role in the Vote Leave campaign.A crunch decision in the coming weeks on whether to extend Brexit trade talks with the EU or risk compounding the economic crisis by trading on WTO rules will be an early test.Mr Johnsonrsquos actions this week have made selling his plans to the country, particularly on Europe and the painful response to the looming recession, immeasurably harder.Hersquos got it coming to him."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds-oldest-bug-found-scotland","story":"The -million-year-old millipede fossil is older than any insect, spider or other creepy crawly ever recorded.It has caused scientists to rethink how bugs and plants evolved, suggesting it was more rapidly than previously thought.They are now believed to have moved from lakes to complex forests in just  million years.Researchers at the University of Texas in Austin, US, made the discovery while exploring Kerrera in the Scottish Inner Hebrides.They used a ldquodelicate technique involving extracting microscopic minerals from the rock sediment which the fossil was preserved in.Once the minerals, known as zircons, were released from the surrounding rock, the team were on an ldquoeagle-eyed hunt with a pin glued to the tip of a pencil.Analysis determined the ancient millipede fossil is  million years old - about  million years younger than the age other scientists had estimated the oldest to be.And other research using similar fossil dating methods found the oldestfossil of a land-dwelling stemmed plant - also from Scotland - to be the same age.The improved dating technique was fine-tuned by Stephanie Suarez, a doctoral student at the University of Houston.She had previously used the technique to find that a dferent millipede specimen, thought to be the oldest bug at the time, was about  million years younger than estimated - a discovery that stripped it of the title of oldest bug.The team used the same technique in this study to pass the crown to a new specimen and to gain new insight into the origin and rapid evolution of bugs and plants.Michael Brookfield, research associate at UT Austinrsquos Jackson School of Geosciences and adjunct professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said: ldquoItrsquos a big jump from these tiny guys to very complex forest communities, and in the scheme of things, it didnrsquot take that long.ldquoIt seems to be a rapid radiation of evolution from these mountain valleys, down to the lowlands, and then worldwide after that.The authors believe there could be older bug and plant fossils out there, but they have not been discovered - even in areas known for preserving delicate fossils from the same era.The findings were published in the journal Historical Biology."},{"url":null,"title":"sunaks-100bn-scheme-could-push-people-poverty-says-snp","story":"Last night Mr Sunak said firms would have to start contributing to furloughed employeesrsquo wages in September, and by October they will be expected to pay % of their reduced salaries.Speaking during the Downing Street coronavirus briefing, the Chancellor said: ldquoAcross the country, office lights will be turned on and windows thrown open. Work clothes and school unorms will be pulled out of the wardrobe.ldquoShops and factories will start to hum with activity...ldquoOur top priority has always been to support people, protect jobs and businesses through this crisis. The furlough and self-employment schemes have been a leline for millions of people and businesses.ldquoWe stood behind Britainrsquos businesses and workers as we came into this crisis, and we stand behind them as we come through the other side.ldquoNow, as we begin to re-open our country and kick-start our economy, these schemes will adjust to ensure those who are able to work can do so, while remaining amongst the most generous in the world.He said that firms will be expected to start paying national insurance and pension contributions from August, and in September they will also be asked to pay % of their furloughed staff salaries. The Government will pay the remaining %.The following month companies will increase their share of wage contributions to %, with the government decreasing its payment to %. After October , the scheme will end.The chancellor said overall businesses using the job scheme for furloughed employees would only have to pay around % of what they would have paid to retain the workersthe policy had not been in place.Mr Sunak also extended the self-employment income support scheme, which has seen . million claims worth pound. billion, to enable freelancers to access a second grant of up to pound from August. Iniduals could claim up to pound under the first grant, which launched earlier this month.Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds welcomed the extension, but said it was ldquoconcerning that there is no commitment within these plans for support to only be scaled back in step with the removal of lockdown.She added: ldquoNor is there any analysis of the impact on unemployment of a lsquoone size fits allrsquo approach being adopted across all sectors.ldquoThe Chancellor must publish the evidence behind these decisions to provide reassurance that his proposals wonrsquot cause an additional spike in unemployment, and an even more dficult economic recovery from this crisis.The Scottish Governmentrsquos Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop MSP said she welcomed the extension, but said: ldquoWhile some employers will be able to contribute to the costs of the scheme, this cannot be a blanket approach across all employers and sectors.ldquoThere remain some sectors that will likely still face restrictions in August, or where we know recovery will take a bit longer and ldquoI do not think it is realistic to expect employers who continue to face these challenges to have to contribute to the scheme.ldquoThis is a particular concern for some sectors, such as the hospitality sector, where a very large proportion of employees are currently furloughed.ldquoIf there is not some allowance for this then this may just delay, rather than avoid, mass redundancies and business closures.The SNPrsquos Shadow Chancellor Alison Thewliss MP said the changes could push impoverished people further towards the brink.She said: ldquoThe changes risk pushing businesses to the brink, forcing self-employed people further into hardship, and could cost countless jobs across the UK.ldquoRather than restricting financial support for those impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, the Chancellor must strengthen support and fully extend the schemes for as long as is necessary to ensure a strong economic recovery.ldquoWorkers and employers must not be penalised due to the pandemic, and moves to reduce financial assistance to businesses could end up sending unemployment soaring as they are forced to make mass redundancies or take on unmanageable debt.Meanwhile Alister Jack, secretary of State for Scotland said the overall package of support had kept thousands f Scots in employment since the start of the coronavirus crisis.He said: ldquoThis extension of support for the self-employed and the further detail on the furlough scheme will provide reassurance for people and businesses across Scotland.ldquoThese schemes form part of an unprecedented package of support which has saved many Scots from losing their jobs and seen thousands of people continue to be paid while they are unable to work.ldquo[The] announcement gives businesses the ability to bring people back on a part-time basis while the UK Government continues to pay the vast majority of their salary.

This has been a leline for the majority of Scottish businesses preventing a mass tsunami of people losing their jobs.ldquoThe big challenge for Scottish businesses is that the UK governmentrsquos new tapered approach to the furlough scheme is not aligned with the Scottish Governmentrsquos roadmap out of lockdown. This misalignment will affect crucial areas of the economy such as tourism which are forced to close for longer.ldquoBefore tapering hits, we need to ensure all sectors of our economy are able to generate trade so they are able to pay employees. Currently there is still a lack of clarity for businesses in Scotland over when they can re-open.ldquoWe urge the Chancellor to adopt measures to ensure that businesses facing ruin as the furlough scheme tapers arenrsquot forced to fall at the last hurdle.rsquorsquoThe JRS and the Self-Employed Income Support Schemehas cost the UK Government around poundbn already, and is anticipated to cost more than poundbn in total.It is one of the largest ever financial support packages provided by the government to workers, but is less than the poundbn paid out to banks during the  financial crash.Previously business leaders called for the Chancellor to introduce dferent furlough payment schemes depending on which industry firms were in, with some areas expected to be hit worse than others.Tourism firms, for example, could lose up to a year of incomethey cannot open before the peak season ends in September.Federation of Small BusinessesScotland Policy Chair, Andrew McRae said firms in these industries may need more long-term support, despite the Chancellor ruling out any extension to the financial support schemes after October.Mr McRae said: ldquoThere may be certain sectors for whom ato any sort of revenue generation remains some way off ndash such as those in and reliant upon Scotlandrsquos visitor economy, for example. Depending on how things progress over the summer, we might need to look at longer-term support for those particular parts of the economy.He said the announcement, on the whole, would give businesses ldquoadditional certainty for the next few months, and added: ldquoldquoWersquove long argued that by extending the job retention scheme while making it more flexible we can help to get the economy back on its feet.

The scale of the hit to our economy means that many businesses will go to the wall, with those most impacted in work places and sectors that will continue to be affected by physical distancing measures.The Treasury last night said that many more firms would have closed without the scheme.A spokesman said: ldquoThe way we look at it is, how many people would not have had their jobs protectedwe hadnrsquot done this ldquoThe Chancellor has always been clear, including in the speech he gave towards the end of March when he launched the scheme, that we canrsquot protect every job. We will be in a very deep recession in the next quarter.When pressed on whether the department had done any analysis of unemployment rates as a result of the policy, he said: ldquoThere are estimates out there,they all depend on scenarios for how long this goes on for.

The whole spirit of lockdown hung on this idea that we were in it together. We were standing as one. And evenyou didnrsquot quite believe that whole storyline, and saw the chilling inequality statistics around those who were dying from it, most of us were behaving like it was true. We were ready to buy into the idea that we were getting closer, supporting each other more, doing what it takes to keep the virus at bay.It feels that idea is crumbling, dying with the echoes of that final clap for carers. Why  Mostly, because of Dominic Cummings and because something in his support by Boris Johnson and others seems to suggest that they all always thought that there were dferent rules for them. We suspect their lockdown was done in a spirit of exceptionalism ndash we never were together in this.It may have been a system of rules that Dominic Cummings violated ndash Durham police have said they regard his visit to Barnard Castle as a minor breach ndash but many of us are feeling the assault personally. Violation is a visceral feeling. We experience it all the more intensely now, in this period in which we have come to see ourselves more as one body, one herd, in which the virus is at large. I feel it physically, bodily, every time I hear more of the Cummings story ndash because we know our own struggles to keep with the rules, and we have a sense of ourselves as a group doing it together. I feels like betrayal. It churns in the gut like bad faith. Its also ndash Johnson beware ndash not a feeling we are ever likely to forget.Vicky Allan: Lockdown has turned us into liars and rule-bendersFreeFreedom is a barbecue, or maybe a picnic with another household, where you get have to bring your own cutlery and not touch the other peoplersquos food. Itrsquos meeting family members who live within a five-mile radius of your home, but keeping the two-metre gap, and not hugging. Definitely no hugging. Of course, thatrsquos not all that freedom is. To some people it might be, as it was in Peterborough last week, a mass rave in a house of  people. To others it might be being able to wander down the middle of the street because itrsquos lockdown and there are no cars ndash a freedom now lost.Irsquod been saying that the new rules were just going to really be equivalent to the old rules as bent by most people already, but this idea that we could actually go and spend time with another family, sit in my sister-in-lawrsquos garden for her birthday next week, almost gave me a flurry of giddiness. Could that really be true  Was it even right  It feels almost like someone is playing some trick, or offering something that might immediately be taken away.

They cant hold a candle to a place where the coffee and cake are God-tier.There is something transcendental about strolling through the aisles of a garden centre that makes me feel asle is filled with infinite possibility. A sense of peace descends and all the white noise fades away.Show me a trestle table filled with bedding plants or a twirling rack of vegetable seeds and I get the same tension release in my shoulders that other people experience when they step into a spa.Thats why I cant fathom the recent grumblings about garden centres reopening.

I dont understand why gardening is suddenly being pigeonholed as a largely middle-class pursuit. Working-class families have always grown things and taken pride in their patches ndash big and small.My family certainly did. I remember both sets of grandparents, hailing from small mining villages in central Scotland, cultivating flowers and vegetables.When I didnt have a garden and lived in a second-floor tenement flat in the east end of Glasgow, I grew chillies on my kitchen windowsill, alongside a few tomato plants, some cress and lettuce.Theres been a lot of talk, quite rightly, about the importance of supporting small local businesses during lockdown. Which is why Ive made the point of ordering produce from my local garden centre in recent months, just as I did the local butcher and other family-run retailers.: Susan Swarbrick: Theof s-style holidays  Count me inPlants are perishable. They have a shelf le. What do you think was happening to them while garden centres were closed  Unlike a pair of jeans or a T-shirt, they cant be held in stock for a later date.

The future is in flux. If wersquore to protect people and democracy, and promote common decency and fairness, then rules must change. Just when things seem darkest, perhaps thinking the unthinkable will help build a better world. Here are  hard questions that need asked ... and answered.Do schools really work It takes a village to raise a child, right  Not in the modern world. During coronavirus teachers and parents have been basically left to fend for themselves.On government performance, itrsquos a clear case of \"must do better\".Teachers work hard, parents do their bit and pupils want to succeed. Itrsquos not the people who need to improve ndash itrsquos the system itself. Classes sizes are maxing out, therersquos not enough support staff.One radical idea which would change education forever is the idea of civic mass participation in schooling. Each adult should play a role ndash to the best of their ability ndash in the education of children.Why shouldnrsquot a journalist like me help out in English classes at my local school once a month  Or advise on the schoolrsquos online newspaper  Why shouldnrsquot a firefighter take safety classes, or maintain school emergency plans  Why wouldnrsquot a chef help prepare lunches  Or a retired soldier assist with PE Citizen participation shouldnrsquot just depend on skill sets, though. A journalist doesnrsquot have to help with media projects. I could tidy school grounds collect tickets at the school concert. Itrsquos simple participation that matters.Not only would children thrive educationally, wersquod all feel the reward of mentorship, and a sense of community would grow from mass participation. Schools would become every communityrsquos beating heart ndash just as churches once were.We live in a fractured society ndash placing the school at the centre of our lives would address that dys.We all know the only way to fix societyrsquos ills is with good education. In his final book, Brief Answers to the Big Questions, Professor Stephen Hawking addressed how we build a better future. His answer was simple: education.Some may say mass citizen participation in education is utopian ndash thatrsquos true, the idea quite literally has its roots in Utopia, Thomas Morersquos  book imagining a better world. In musing on the perfect education system, the Renaissance philosopher also says that learning must be lelong ndash again, another ideal we know we should emulate.Perhaps we should also consider emphasising critical thinking and civics in schools, at a time when facts are threatened, hate is spiralling and democracy is being undermined. Ending digital poverty is key to reimagining education ndash with a laptop for every child.If education was central to society ndash and we paid educators accordingly ndash then maybe it wouldnrsquot feel to many of us that wersquore living in an age of idiocracy, with reason a thing of the past.Should we bring back national service This isnrsquot about the military, but rather a \"national youth corps\" that guarantees a paid job to young people, providing them with skills and inculcating a sense of community.Coronavirus has left the young in greatest financial jeopardy. This summer will see the cruellest labour market for  years. Youth unemployment could hit , shortly. In a world where governments have shamefully abandoned the ideal of full employment, a national youth corps at least places some onus on politicians to promote the dignity of work.Youth corps jobs shouldnrsquot prop up private industry, but make the country a better place. What are the big social problems we face  An ageing population, homelessness, rising mental health problems, social isolation, not enough support staff in schools, hospitals and social work.If young people were paid to help out in these key areas theyrsquod benefit immeasurably and so would society. Wersquod foster a generation of caring, independently-minded active citizens who see it as a duty to improve the world.Just this week, a raft of voices from academia, youth charities, think tanks, and the arts favoured a national youth corps. It would be a leline for a generation facing desperate times.Should politicians earn the national average wage Unless you live in New Zealand, itrsquos hard to see politics as anything other than a failure amid coronavirus.Politics has been shown to be venal, secretive and inadequate ndash and one could argue thatrsquos because wersquove allowed a rarefied political class to embed itself in society. Think-tankers, special advisers and political researchers coalesce, define their vision of the world and then become the next raft of MPs and MSPs, with the addition of a few ambitious lawyers and jaded journalists.It doesnrsquot work. Itrsquos not politics which has failed but politicians. Many of societyrsquos best people donrsquot go to work for big salaries, but because they believe in what theyrsquore doing ndash nurses and teachers are just two examples.Slash politicians pay down to the national average wage ndash about poundk a year ndash and letrsquos seewe get a better class of candidate.Perhaps politicians should also have a maximum term in office  Politics is cosy, and cosy means lazy ndash there are backbenchers drawing salaries who we never hear from, so maybe no politician should hold office for more than  years. That would refresh the talent pool, keep politicians on their toes, and mean new ideas rather than self-interest were the driving force behind government.During coronavirus some legislatures went digital. As weto normality, would an increase in online committee hearings and debates keep the cost of politics down Therersquos a fear of even discussing issues like compulsory voting to tackle declining participation and trust in democracy. But should we be even more daring in discussing the future  Shouldnrsquot we also strengthen global governance Coronavirus proves global unity matters. If wersquod listened to the World Health Organisation ndash or been made to listen by a strong United Nations ndash countries would have been testing, tracing and isolating from early on.On a planetary level, how do we deal with the rise of robotics and AI, which will destroy jobs with virus-like speed, unless we find a common way, through global agreement, to harness technology safely. Do we need to reimagine the United Nations Is it time to nationalise care homes Itrsquos hard to give any answer other than \"yes\". Care homes are the epicentre of the coronavirus catastrophe. Therersquos a horrible irony that while we celebrated VE Day, the last veterans were dying in their thousands, out of sight and out of mind, in care homes.Care and health must be synced. Governments have long talked about it and done little. The national disgrace of mounting care home deaths surely demands that once this pandemic is under control, then nationalisation must be one of the first pieces of legislation enacted.Should we let the oil industry die Itrsquos a brutal question to ask ndash but we must think the unthinkable now.Coronavirus proves humanityrsquos frailty in the face of nature. However, the virus also hands us the perfect opportunity to tackle climate change. Oil and gas prices are at rock bottom. The invisible hand of the market is already pointing to the exit door for an industry which has played a huge part in destabilising the planetrsquos eco-system.Perhaps itrsquos time to administer the euthanising injection  However, that canrsquot be done unless every job in the oil and gas sector can be replaced with jobs in clean and green industries.Getting economies back on their feet doesnrsquot mean throwing cash at old, dirty industries on their last legs, but funding new, clean industries which represent the future and innovation. The oil and gas industry is a dead ndash and heavily subsidised ndash weight on the world a green economy would herald a new age.Low interest rates caused by coronavirus also mean entrepreneurial borrowing to help forge these new industries would come within a financial sweet spot. As the economy shts towards environmentalism, green utilities should be kept in public ownership and made part of a sovereign wealth fund which can be used for the benefit of the people.The time is right for change, the only question is: do we have the courage to take the first radical step Should we ban cars from cities City le needs reshaped ndash coronavirus has taught us that much. Itrsquoll be a long time until consumers pack out shopping districts again. In a world of social distancing, pavements need to get bigger, and so roads need to get smaller. Wersquove all noticed how fresh the air is now car travel has dropped. Many have taken to cycling.Reimagining the shape of our cities and our relationship to the car, really isnrsquot revolutionary. Birmingham had already moved to ban private cars taking trips through the city before coronavirus. York announced plans to ban private car journeys last year.In an age of declining income, wersquoll need more not less public transport ndash especially as social distancing will mean fewer people able to travel on inidual buses and trains. The car will have to move out of the way when it comes to city le.Our cities need greened as well. More parks, not more pound stores. The rise of online shopping points that way already. A park could create as many jobs as a pound store ndash with coffee stalls, ground keepers and fitness advisers.As high street shops, pubs and restaurants are mothballed by profit-driven shareholders, so smaller, less greedy, inidually-owned enterprises will replace them. With our high streets dying, cities could become places of outdoor and indoor leisure ringed by entrepreneurial local firms providing food, drink and entertainment: a stroll in a city centre garden followed by a snack at a locally owned cafe, a movie at an independent cinema and then a drink in a locally owned pub. Turn abandoned city centre properties into social housing.Declining international tourism will also reshape cities. Itrsquos already happening in Venice. Wersquore entering the age of rail again. More holidays will be via trains to Cornwall not planes to Malaga.Are we at risk of becoming a medicalised society Coronavirus has two good consequences: first, wersquove focused more on our personal health second, wersquove finally recognised the value of NHS workers. However, we need to beware this doesnrsquot tip over into extremes. After the First World War, veterans were put on a pedestal ndash no wrong could be said of them. We donrsquot want that for doctors and nurses.First, theyrsquore ordinary people, and we know that before coronavirus medics made mistakes just like other professionals. If we describe people only as \"heroes\" we cannot objectively value their contribution to society ndash and NHS workers contribute vastly.Second,we call people \"heroes\" we tend not to askthose heroes need pay rises. Nurses need recompense, but so far wersquove only \"clapped for carers\", not demanded decent salaries.Finally, wersquore at risk of elevating health into a cult. In a post-coronavirus world, will smokers, the over-weight, someone who drinks or those who arenrsquot fit enough, be penalised for their lestyles in a society which has become too health conscious  We know such thinking has been around for years.Coronavirus must leave a legacy, but not one were the simplest joys are frowned upon.Should social media be regulated like the BBC One of the most disturbing aspects of the pandemic has been the spread of conspiracy theories online. From G links to claims of Chinese labs releasing the virus, lies have multiplied throughout lockdown.Until Wednesday ndash when Twitter tried to rein in Donald Trump ndash social media did nothing to stem the tide of dangerous disinformation. However, as Twitter faced threats of retribution from Trump, Facebookrsquos Mark Zuckerberg attacked the rival company saying it wasnrsquot the place of social media to interfere with free speech.This newspaper cannot publish a letter calling for murder or rape, nor can it publish deliberate lies. Laws hold the old media to account. New media must play by the same rules.Is it time to end charity Charity is the mark of a personrsquos humanity. When practised properly therersquos no higher moral action. But we live in a society were charity fills in for government failure. It was ordinary people who raised millions for protective hospital gear.Therersquos a simple fix for this ndash proper taxation. Are you happy to pay a few more pennies in tax so no child goes hungry, or do you prefer Children in Need taking on the role of the treasury Equally fraught is the question of foreign aid. Covid is reordering priorities. Should aid go to nations like India, with its own space programme  Or to nations that seemingly need it more. At the very least, an intelligent national debate is required, free from racism and concepts like \"deserving poor\".Do we need a wealth revolution Inequality has advanced steadily since the s ndash and yet we know that societies with greater income equality are happier and healthier.Itrsquos not utopian to stop offshore tax avoidance, to make multinationals pay their fair share. Itrsquos not revolutionary to say that a billionaire could pay s levels of tax and still have more money than theyrsquod ever spend in ten letimes. Itrsquos not radical to inflict heavier waste taxes on polluting corporations, or limit corporate political donations.Throughout coronavirus wersquove seen large companies prioritise money over people. Worker participation in companies would end that. If every board had half of its membership elected from the workforce, shareholder greed would be curbed, unnecessary lay-offs prevented, pay fairly apportioned, rights protected, staff respected.The workplace must be reimagined. A four-day week ndash as long as it doesnrsquot lower worker wages ndash might be one way to improve quality of le for the majority. The debate about a universal basic income, however, too often misses the fact that it could institutionalise poverty.Coronavirus has shown us the brutality of inequality. The poor are dying faster than the rich. Therersquos a growing groundswell of intellectual opinion that a society which judges itself purely by GDP ndash by wealth ndash is a failed society. Why not judge ourselves by higher standards like a GDP in happiness, health, wellbeing, freedom, education.Our societies are too stratied. The rich live here, the poor there, the middle class somewhere in between. Top-quality social housing would even out disparities. A good society would see a plumber living beside a doctor, and a teacher beside a shop worker ndash not in class-based enclaves.The biggest change of all would be learning how others live, not just those in the same bubble as ourselves.What questions would you ask of the post-Covid world  Send your questions ... and your answers ... to sunday-letters@theherald"},{"url":null,"title":"ron-mckays-diary-cummings-catchphrases-brave-new-world-yer-bike","story":"I DONT know why Dominic Cummings, his we Mary and son stayed in the cottage close to his fatherrsquos gaff because they could have tootled on a bit further and stayed in splendour with the in-laws.

Welcome to the pantheon, hen.A future rewindI STILL have the money in my pocket from the car I sold just before the lockdown began. Eighty pounds. There hasnrsquot been much opportunity to spend it, with the supermarkets pressuring for card payments as a protective measure, but it really does pose the question, which I always thought an abstract one: when this is all over will we be in that long-promised cashless society  That seemed absurd not long ago but now appears to be the present.The wider issue is whether therersquos going to be a new future, or one much the same as before, with added face masks  I take the pessimistic line that those with power will fight to retain it while the rest of us just want to get on with our lives in much the same way as we did, those who have jobs toto of course, and financial security.Therersquos been massive support for businesses ndash and trickle-down to families ndash from the Government, and the meter is still ticking. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that borrowing to pay for it all could more than treble from what it was before Covid, to pound billion, and that could be conservative.By contrast, the pumping into the economy in the  financial crisis, effectively to save the banks, now looks like chump change. The result was the imposition of  years of austerity and meagre growth. This Tory Government has been sending signals that this will be their way out of it again. So will people accept it  Probably.In the wake of the Second World War, with Britain massively indebted, the answer wasnrsquot to clamp down on spending but to increase central government investment including the creation of the welfare state. Just as, earlier, Franklin Rooseveltrsquos New Deal, massive public investment, dragged the US out of the s Great Depression.It was all about industrialisation then, but we arenrsquot going there again, are we  The skies may be clearer and our lungs a little cleaner because of the lockdown but is there a Green New Deal on thehorizon  Where will the pressure to create it come from If technology is the answer itrsquos the wrong question. Irsquom with the American economist Robert Gordon, a techno-pessimist, who argues there hasnrsquot really been a great leap forward. He imagines someone who goes to sleep towards the end of the th century and wakes up after the Second World War. The present would be unrecognisable, with the internal combustion engine, telecommunications, electricity, even fledgling computers. In comparison, someone who took a nap in  and woke up at the beginning of the st century would be unfamiliar, says Gordon, only with the microwave.If there is going to be a New Future we better wake up, define it, and get on with it.Hit the roadAs part of my green revolution, the spoked kind, I dug out my old bicycle which must be around  years old. Itrsquos named after Barry Hoban who, until Mark Cavendish came along, had the most stage wins of any Brit in the Tour de France. He also married the widow of legendary cyclist Tom Simpson who, full of amphetamines, collapsed a kilometre from the summit of Mont Ventoux in the  tour and died. His last words were: ldquoPut me back on my bike.And so I set off in the sun after a few minor adjustments. Not, unfortunately, to the back brake which decided to play coy on a downward descent, I hit a rut and ended up, ignominiously, on the road. A kindly fellow cyclist, with rather better control of his machine, helped me up and the driver of the Number  bus got out to seeI was all right. Without further assistance, physical or chemical, I wiped away the blood and got back on Barry. Unfortunately, I had forgotten to use Simpsonrsquos outro line.

Yet despite being raised in the shadow of the hills, Scott Gammie admits that until lockdown prompted him to dig the bike out of the shed, he hadnrsquot explored any of them.ldquoI grew up in this area, he says. ldquoIrsquove been up in the Pentlands on foot but not on bike. Now Irsquom out every day, and Irsquove been to places I never knew existed despite living here for  years.Since lockdown rules turned family le on its head, Scott, , we Dawn,  and boys Matt, , and nine-year-old Euan have discovered a new love for cycling.ldquoWhen things stopped and I started working from home, we got the bikes out and found ourselves going further and further, he says.ldquoNow the boys are used to being on the roads, their road awareness is improving, and we all love it.Cycling has emerged as one of the few winners from the current pandemic, with bike shops reporting soaring sales and waiting lists of up to three months for new bikes.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson recently confirmed cycling levels are % higher compared with the lockdown baseline, while Cycling Scotlandrsquos automatic cycling counters at  spots around the country revealed remarkable results, with one in Dunfermline recording an increase of % since lockdown.ldquoI donrsquot think anyone could have foreseen the level of increase in demand for bikes, says Chris Tiso, whose Tiso Group runs Alpine Bikes, Scotlandrsquos largest independent bike retailer.ldquoBetween our two bike stores in Edinburgh and Aberdeen and online, wersquore selling between  to  bikes a week which is signicantly more than we would expect.ldquoAll bike retailers have been swamped by the most phenomenal demand. No-one anticipated it. Suppliers have reached the stage where they have almost run out of bikes.Most sales are entry range bikes between pound to pound,, suggesting that theyrsquore being snapped up by people looking to start cycling or getting back after a break, he adds.ldquoHopefully something positive will emerge as far as the nationrsquos health is concerned, and wersquoll be healthier, fitter than when we went into this, he adds.As well as boosting fitness levels, the cycling boom is also changing the face of some of our most-used streets ndash potentially paving the way for vehicles to finally be overtaken by the humble bike.The Scottish Government last week boosted funding for local authorities to create infrastructure which will support physical distancing and cater for a sht from public transport, from pound million to poundm.Edinburgh City Council, which has received poundm from the fund, has plans to close off key city centre roads to cars, including East Princes Street and Market Street.Other routes in Greenbank, Leith, Cammo and Silverknowes have already closed, while a segregated cycleway on Old Dalkeith Road, between Cameron Toll and the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, is also being created.Cllr Anna Richardson, convener for sustainability and carbon reduction, says: ldquoWe want to encourage cycling as a longer-term, attractive travel choice, particularly for commuters, and we are moving at pace to provide reassurance that people can move around the city safely.Cycling Scotland chief executive Keith Irving says: ldquoWe hope that these measures will become part of permanent cycling networks. The top priority to ensure more people cycle is dedicated, segregated cycling paths, separate from traffic.ldquoIncreasing access to bikes, places to store them and cycle training wherever required are the other measures to ensure even more people can enjoy cycling for essential journeys or exercise.Even with new cycle lanes, we have a lot of pedalling to do to catch up with some of our European cousins: in the Netherlands, % of journeys are by bike, while in Denmark the figure is %. Prior to lockdown, Britain managed just % of journeys by bike.And there are lingering concerns that the rise in cycling may be offset by people who would normally use public transport choosing to travel by car instead.ldquoTherersquos no doubt therersquos an increase in cyclists, but Irsquom not convinced itrsquos driven by anything more than leisure and keeping fit, he says. ldquoThere seems to be a big rush to change things when we donrsquot know what the new normal is.ldquoWhen people do go back to work, they will still be living in suburbs, theyrsquoll still work in dferent parts of the city, and still want to get around. Evenwe multiply cycling -fold, itrsquos not close to the amount of trips done by car.ldquoItrsquos taking a bit of a punt to hope that people will stick with bicycles.To do that, Tim Burns of Sustrans suggests there will have to be more than pop-up cycle routes.ldquoEven the most ambitious plans for walking and cycling from cities across the UK are unlikely to meet the needs of all people who formerly took public transport, he says.He suggests making mph the default speed in all urban and residential areas, removing VAT from cycle sales, more cycle parking, free cycle servicing, and the development of ldquopark and cycle facilities at park and ride hubs.ldquoStaggering sht patterns during the day and rotating shts during which people can come into the office will also be important, he adds.At home in Edinburgh, Scott Gammie ndash who, ironically, works in the car trade as a franchise principle at Lexus in Edinburgh and Glasgow ndash is certain the family will be more than just lockdown cyclists.ldquoWersquoll keep doing this, he says. ldquoMy we is now planning to cycle to work in the city centre. I will have to drive for work, but the goal is to make sure we maintain what wersquove started.ldquoReally, it would be criminal for me not to find a way of keeping on cycling."},{"url":null,"title":"mod-cons-move-rise-scotlands-hutting-communities","story":"They have no mod cons.

The drainage is done. Then itrsquos up to the hutters to build their hut.The Encampment,  acres of wild forest land sandwiched between a Roman fort and motorways with Tinto Hill in the distance, is finally taking shape.Sixteen plots, each offering space for a hut of up to  square metres, have been sectioned off and all but four leases signed. Therersquos a car park, drainage and a path ndash and not much .Now, with lockdown partly lted, itrsquos expected that the first huts ndash simple structures without frills and definitely no WiFi ndash will begin to take shape.It is a sign that hutting, popular in Norway and with its own Scottish heritage in the form of shepherdsrsquo shelters, bothies, holiday huts and Broons-style but and bens, may be set to fulfil predictions of becoming the next big thing.And with foreign travel largely off the agenda, the ldquostaycation on the rise and Scots emerging from lockdown with a new appreciation for birdsong, traffic-free streets, peace and quiet, therersquos a chance that the appeal of the woodland hut could be set to soar even higher.ldquoWersquore on the cusp of things really happening, says Donald McPhillimy of Reforesting Scotland, which has been at the forefront of the hutting revival in Scotland with its , Huts campaign.ldquoDuring this period of lockdown people have had the chance to connect with nature, they hear the birdsong, there are no airline trails in the sky and therersquos less noise from the main roads.ldquoNature is showing us its better side, and you can see the appeal of having a nice little hut thatrsquos comfortable and warm to retreat to.The hutting trend has been brewing since  when a sht in planning legislation paved the way for simple countryside structures.Inidual huts have popped up on land dotted around the country. However, it is only now that larger woodland hutting communities are on the verge of becoming properly established.Lee Paton, who runs Torr Organic Farm near Castle Douglas with her brother Ross, recently established six huts on the land along with one that is a remnant from an earlier collection of huts run by her father.ldquoThere were five huts here in the s but they fell out of use, probably because of package holidays and people going abroad, she says.ldquoYoursquore either a hut nut or yoursquore not. Most have some insulation, wood-burning stoves, bottled gas for a cooker and solar power for lights ndash mine is lit with candles and an oil lamp.She now has a waiting list of people looking to take on a hut. ldquoI think the ball is rolling now, landowners are coming on board now they understand what itrsquos about.According to McPhillimy there are at least  huts dotted around Scotland with many dating to the early s when holidays were much simpler.ldquoThey give people a little stake in the Scottish countryside, especially for people in cities and towns who want somewhere they can go to whenever they want,\" he says.ldquoThey give people a chance to get away from the hustle and bustle, and to connect with nature.A Reforesting Scotland hutting project on Forestry and Land Scotland land at Carnock Wood in Fe attracted  applicants when its  plots became available.The leaseholders, including a yoga teacher, an accountant, an architect, a gardener and a foster family, are currently drawing up a code of conduct ndash laying down rules over issues such as dogs, garden areas and noise levels in preparation for the first huts to be built.However, lockdown and a series of other hurdles means the first huts are unlikely to take shape until next summer.Elsewhere, at Cash Strip Wood, off the A between Falkland and Strathmiglo in Fe, there are plans for  huts on a -hectare site. Huts are also understood to be planned for woodlands in Wigtownshire and Aberfeldy.To meet planning restrictions, huts can be no more than  square metres, not connected to water, electricity or sewage systems and be easily removed at the end of their lespan, ideally leaving no or little trace.While many are simple structures and intended to blend with the surrounding wood or countryside, some can take on the appearance of small homes, with picket fences and gardens.Scotlandrsquos ldquospiritual home of hutting is at Carbeth in Stirlingshire, established in  as a retreat for soldiers ing from the First World War. It has more than  huts and is the worldrsquos largest single community-owned hutting organisation.The basic huts of  years ago, however, will have cost substantially less than todayrsquos versions: huts can cost from pound, to pound, to build depending on style, materials and construction fees.Hutters at The Encampment will pay around pound, for their plot and choose from one of three styles of hut that already has planning permission, or opt for their own design.In , theyrsquoll share their space with foxes, deer and badgers beneath birch trees and alongside the remains of the Roman fort.ldquoItrsquos not glamping, adds Witter, a legal adviser in Aberdeenrsquos chemical sector. ldquoItrsquos very low-tech.

The architect of it, former chancellor George Osborne, is already on the record. ldquoWhen this is over there is going to be a very large amount of debt and itrsquos not going to be bonanza time, he said. ldquoWersquoll be going back into a period of retrenchment and trying to bring public-sector debt down. That is something we can focus on later. The IMF has his back.No George, now! Steep cuts in welfare spending hit the poorest hardest, catapulted hundreds of thousands into universal debt not credit, brought in zero-hours contracts, the exponential growth in foodbanks, poverty cooks telling us how to live off insects or foraging, the rise of cut-price supermarkets, and a drop in real wages ndashyou were fortunate enough to have a job in the public sector. In the private, of course, executive salaries and bonuses mushroomed while wages and conditions collapsed.Are we going back there  Major employers are already using the present Covid crisis to cut back on staff, with the likes of BA handing out redundancy notices to thousands of staff holding out that some may be brought back on reduced salaries and fewer rights.One in four employers expects to make substantial redundancies according to one authoritative survey, while academics at the University of Essex are predicting six-and-a-half million on the dole, with the hardest hit young people.At the end of the Second World War, Britain came out of it with debt at around % of GDP, and just  years after it the prime minister, Harold Macmillan, was able to boom: ldquoYoursquove never had it so good. This was down to massive increases in the major industries in production of the things we donrsquot have any more here ndash steel, coal and motor cars. As well as in the public sector with the creation of the welfare state.In the s after the Great Depression, Franklin Rooseveltrsquos New Deal in the US invested in a series of programmes and public works projects, providing support for farmers, the unemployed and old and young people, and also culture.It was Margaret Thatcher who destroyed the post-war consensus, the belief in a mixed economy, and implemented the ideas of right-wing economic zealots like Milton Friedman and FA Hayek, as well as her tub-thumping chief adviser Keith Joseph, a man who makes Dominic Cummings look like a rule-following diligent.Just as there was no such thing as society ndash a nonsense that has been disproved, not least in the current crisis ndash the ldquonanny state had to be dismembered. Full employment was ditched, job insecurity made workers more malleable, establishing in this country one of the most deregulated economies in the Western world ndash the Big Bang ndash and selling off state enterprises, after years of starved investment, like water, British Airways, British Telecom, gas, electric and railways. Does any sentient being today believe that rail is better than it was There was economic growth, although nothing compared with that of our competitors. And growth, as someone said, hopefully not an economist, has the marvellous quality of stilling discontent while maintaining privilege. That growth, over the decades, made the debts of the Second World War inconsequential, although getting debt down was the obsession of George Osborne, a man with a history degree who ought to have known better. The burden of inherited debt was brought down over time without austerity.The state cupboard is bare now. The sales went to make comparatively few people obscenely wealthy and paid pension funds. The latest prediction is that the cost of state interventionwhich has saved mass poverty and, who knows, rioting in the streets, may cost pound billion. It could cost considerably more. UK GDP is around pound trillion with Government debt, as a proportion, at % as of March last year. Nothing like at the end of the Second World War.The cost of borrowing is now almost negligible. If rates stay low, as they will for some years, then doubling debt would still mean the Treasury would be paying less to service it than at any time in the th century.So, we should borrow to invest, evenwe double or treble our debt. Why the Government obsession with debt and borrowings, the stick which the Tories used to beat the hapless Labour administration into decades of powerlessness  Debt could be rolled over forever, meaning wersquod never have to pay it back.The UK tax system is also viciously unjust, it favours income from capital over labour, benefiting the well-off. UK tax rates are also low compared to other G countries. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, hardly a raging inferno of Trotskyism, reports that the middle and top earners pay less than other developed countries and the Treasury take from income taxes is also below average.We need a tax on trading transactions, the Tobin tax, an increase in the derisory low rate of corporation tax, local taxes realistically based on property values, not moored in the last century, and a comprehensive revision of the tax system to make it equitable.And we need to put a stop to absurd vanity projects like the Trident upgrade ndash costing north of poundbn, but take your own guess, it will probably be as accurate ndash where another country, the US, holds the keys anyway, and HS, at poundbn-plus and rising, and put the money into social projects, extending the existing rail network, job creation, the NHS, planning for the pandemics to come, a universal income, councils and infrastructure.Governments throughout the world have shown that faced with immediate and catastrophic danger they can react swtly,less so in the UK, and that paying for it is not an inhibitant.Itrsquos the less pressing, but ultimately planet-ending ones, like global warming that wersquore laggardly, or in denial, over. Itrsquos fine all of us putting our waste in dferent bins but until governments take measures to stop pollution rather than jetting in to exotic places to talk about it, itrsquos like taking an egg cup to bail out a bath.The revival has to put those who were last first, the workers in the NHS, in care homes, transport and essential services, the ones who are presently saving us, with proper wages and conditions that value their crucial contribution.This isnrsquot socialism, itrsquos economic common sense. Properly invest in the NHS, in a Green New Deal, however those who know more about it define it.Itrsquos the politics which matter, not the eggheads with calculators and graphs.

The First Minister has also advised that national parks to keep toilets closed.But Sam Newall, founder of toilet hire company Honeywagon Co, which is based in Gartocharn, in the Loch Lomond National Park, said people have already been travelling to scenic spots despite lockdown restrictions and the problem is clear.The -year-old said: \"Theres nowhere for people to use the loo, which is the big issue.\"Mr Newalls business caters largely for the events industry, which has been decimated by the coronavirus crisis.He is now sitting on a large stock of  single plastic portable toilets,  luxury toilet trailers and  disabled units ndash and wants to use them to ensure hygienic facilities are available around Loch Lomond.Mr Newall sees his business, and others like it, as well placed to help address social distancing problems when it comes to toilets ndash not just in beauty spots, but for pubs and restaurants too.Scotlands four-stage route map out of the coronavirus lockdown could allow restaurants and bars to open outdoor areas as soon as next month.Willie Macleod, the executive director in Scotland of UK Hospitality, said the issue of toilets is being widely discussed in the industry.He said businesses will need \"absolutely enhanced\" cleaning protocols and frequent inspections, and toilets will have to be managed \"very carefully\".Queuing systems are being considered, alongside closing off urinals completely.\"I think there may also have to be some sort of controls over people going in and out,\" Mr Macleod said.\"It may be that you end up with some sort of queuing system thats socially distanced.\"Oryour premises allow it, you might have a one-way route. Its probably quite likely that people are going to have to queue.\"He added: \"It may even be that in gents toilets you would go as far making the urinals out-of-bounds and making the guys use cubicles.\"Mr Macleod said some operators are considering toilet attendants to help handle the changes and there have also been discussions around installing portable toilets in beer gardens.Emma McClarkin, CEO of the Scottish Beer and Pub Association, said businesses will need extra financial support.She said: ldquoSocial-distancing presents numerous challenges for pubs and other businesses in the hospitality sector, the use of toilet facilities being only one.\"Wersquove been working with the Scottish Government and others in the sector to ensure a robust set of guidance and protocols for businesses to follow are in place, which will be published ahead of any reopening.\"All pubs will need to have a plan to control access to facilities and ensure a more frequent cleaning regime is in place following the official advice.\"Additionally, pubs will need to clearly communicate these new restrictions and protocols to their customers, as consumer confidence will be key in ensuring the sector is able to reopen.ldquoThese extra measures will of course come at a cost at a time when businesses are already struggling.\"Extra financial support from Government is desperately needed to help keep Scotlandrsquos hospitality and tourism sector afloat during this continued period of uncertainty.\"She said the current rule around keeping two metres apart will also need to be looked at, as it is unworkable for most pubs.Mr Newall said his business, and others like it, could make a huge dference.He said: \"If youve got a hotel or a restaurant thats got an outdoor seated area, you could potentially just roof the area [with a marquee], not have it walled, so its still open.\"You can then distance the tables, as it were. You can have the toilets integrated at the correct spacing.\"Its just being able to have that area utilised in a dferent way, given the current circumstances, which I think is going to be vital to help businesses kickstart and restart.\"In the beauty spots in the local area,youve got a cafe or a restaurant, the reality isyoure beholden to [people] using your own loo inside and potentially the queuing systems while trying to serve, it would be impossible to keep that social distancing and keep it safe.\"Whereas,you can put some infrastructure in there which will then help, it can make a big dference.\"Id say for business and restaurants and things like that, theyre probably going to need to look at investing a little bit in the hire of these goods to be able to make it possible.\"But Mr Newall said support from the Scottish Government may be needed in larger areas such as car parks and beauty spots.He added: \"What we normally can facilitate for large outdoor events, we can put infrastructure in place for beauty spots and all these areas which are gong to see a huge influx of people, keeping it as safe as possible.\"Its very dficult because it basically requires someone to push it out.\"I think the bottom line is the Government is going to need to put some sort of funding in place to let this happen, because someones going to have to pay for it\".The British Toilet Association has said there may need to be a \"complete rethink\" of public toilets following the coronavirus outbreak.Urinals could be replaced with inidual cubicles, while foot-operated flushes could also be introduced. Self-closing seats, sensor-activated taps and soap dispensers are other options.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoAs we slowly and cautiously ease lockdown measures, we have been clear we simply donrsquot want, in this phase, to see large numbers of people at tourist hot spots or local beauty spots.\"Crowds of people ndash eventheyrsquore trying to socially distance ndash bring more risk than we judge is acceptable and safe at this point.ldquoWe are aware of these issues, and the Tourism Secretary [Fergus Ewing] has agreed to explore best practice with the National Park Authority as part of wider route map reopening work and is clear that social distancing measures must be adhered to.ldquoWhile pubs and restaurants - except for takeaway - must remain closed at this stage, in phase two they can open outdoor spaces with physical distancing and increased hygiene routines, and social distancing measures will remain essential\"."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  39 s Country Life  little people and the tides of time","story":"Hooletrsquos children have never been more conspicuous than in the recent weeks, when their parents take them for their daily pram walk or stroll, or they play in their gardens, making piratical cries.

This boy has his own toy strimmer and ear muffs ndash he has already been identied as our future resident handyman.One family, who arrived in the village with a toddler shortly after us, had a baby at the turn of the year. Probably the youngest member of the village, although by a narrow margin, he is slowly getting familiar with it, by pram and papoose. Meanwhile, his sister visits her favourite haunts, or hangs over the garden gate bidding hello to those of us she recognises. She canrsquot know how much that does for our spirits, but she, and others of her age, are making Hoolet their own. Itrsquos immensely cheering.When they are older, theyrsquoll join the other children ferried to nearby schools. Before lockdown, the school bus would pass our kitchen window on its circuitous journey to the secondary school some miles away. Its passengers seemed to sit as far from each other as possible, absorbed on their phones. If they ever looked our way, would they feel envious of those pouring a second mug of tea, and enjoying a leisurely start to the day rather than facing a double dose of chemistry Not long after we arrived here, I was shown a photo of the village from around . In front of our cottage, in the wide, dusty road, were a handful of schoolgirls. In their crisp white pinafores and straw hats, they looked like illustrations from Little Women. Just up the street is the old schoolhouse, whose plaque tells passers-by it was built in .An earlier school had  fee-paying students and records show that in , Hoolet boasted that by the age of six, everyone could read and write. Older pupils were also taught French, Greek, geography and Latin, although they might have been too cold to concentrate. Apparently in winter the schoolroom temperature plummeted so low that ink in the ink wells would freeze. That aspect of Hoolet is still recognisable. When nearby towns have sleet and rain, we get snow and ice.Photographs from the early s show dozens of neatly dressed pupils by the school, girls dancing hand in hand in a ring, boys running here and there, doubtless kicking a ball or stone. The school closed for good during the Second World War, and has since been a post office, library and shop. Itrsquos the typically chequered career of a building at the heart of many small communities and, equally typically, is now just a desirable property.That glimpse of pinafored schoolgirls by our cottage has stayed with me. In many old snaps the village children are either posed in their classroom outfits, or caught accidentally in passing. In one, from , a fishmonger, smartly dressed in hat and long jacket, has drawn up his horse and trap a few doors from our house. He is handing a parcel to a woman gracefully dressed in a long skirt and blouse.Coming up the road behind is a young lad, barefoot, his trousers short as a sailorrsquos. Did he, or one of the schoolgirls with ribbons in their hair, live in our house  Did they survive the war or the Spanish Flu There are several photos of our cottage from those times which I find unexpectedly eery. You realise how short your occupancy is, and how a house has a le much longer and far-reaching than yours. In these pictures, cows are often grazing on the green, and chickens roam freely. There was a lamppost right outside our gate, almost identical to the one in Narnia. It had a white picket fence in those days, and a steep thatched roof whose grass sprouts on the ridgepole like a horsersquos mane.Roses clamber up the front, but itrsquos pretty scruffy, the walls in need of patching up. Back then, country cottages were neither desirable nor chi-chi. Those with money lived in the mill-ownersrsquo villas, on the south side of Hoolet, mansions maintained by an army of servants.At the back of our cottage was an old cart-house and the corner of the front wall is cut away to allow wagons and traps to scrape past. After this it became a cobblerrsquos. Now it contains my husbandrsquos books, some on floor-to-ceiling bookcases, others simply on the floor, and almost as many stacked in the loft overhead, begging to be shelved.If any villagers from the eve of the First World War ed to Hoolet, theyrsquod recognise it at once. Although there are modern houses, the same old properties line the green and the main street. Unlike in their day, however, it would be hard to survive here without a car or electric bike. Despite the resurgence of local and online deliveries, the village is no longer self-sufficient. It is not a community as its former inhabitants would have understood it.The tide is turning, though, as people appreciate the benefits of country living. Perhaps in our post-pandemic world places likes Hoolet will continue to become more self-reliant and inventively independent. Even so, the chances are that children raised here will leave at some point.

These days ldquoWolf Warrior diplomacy has become the adopted nickname for a new breed of foreign policy implementation in Beijing. Itrsquos all a far cry from the days of Chinarsquos traditional ldquoconceal ambitions, hide claws diplomacy under former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.To see just how much things have changed it only takes a look around Asia to see that therersquos no shortage of the new Chinese wolf warrior diplomacy at work.In disputed waters off the coast of Vietnam these past months, Chinarsquos coastguard rammed and sank a fishing boat, while Chinese ships and maritime militias also swarmed an offshore oil rig operated by Malaysia.Beijing continues also to pile pressure on Taiwan, denouncing the second inauguration of its president Tsai Ing-wen in the hope that she will accept the so-called  Consensus that Taiwan and the mainland are part of one China.And then there is the rather worrying confrontation between China and the worldrsquos other most populous nation, India, which has seen military clashes along their contentious border in the Himalayas resulting, some reports say, in hundreds of casualties.ldquoIt seems that even as China was fighting a disease outbreak, it was also thinking in terms of its long-term strategic goals, observed Alexander Vuving, a professor at the Asia-Pacic Centre for Security Studies in Honolulu in a recent interview with the New York Times.Far and away the most obvious manestation of Chinarsquos wolf warrior diplomacy lately and certainly the crisis causing most global concern is Beijingrsquos move forward with a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong.Though the legislation is yet to be formalised, some critics have called it the ldquoend of Hong Kong. Many fear China will follow through with its implementation, drastically curtailing Hong Kongrsquos political freedoms and criminalising protest and criticism of Beijingrsquos Communist regime and its policies in the territory.ldquoThis is the nuclear option: Beijingrsquos ultimate power to impose whatever it wants on Hong Kong, outside and above Hong Kongrsquos constitutional, political and legal structure, warned Antony Dapiran, a lawyer and author of books on Hong Kongrsquos protest culture, speaking to the Financial Timeslast week.Above all, say such observers, Chinarsquos latest highly controversial move would undermine the principle of ldquoone country, two systems that has underpinned Hong Kongrsquos relations with Chinarsquos central authorities since the British handover in .In response to Chinarsquos move, last yearrsquos pro-democracy protests have already been reignited and the dangerous standoff between the US and China has deepened.Beyond the US, the governments of Britain, Canada and Australia have jointly condemned Chinarsquos decision to impose the law, which they warned in a statement endangered the system that made Hong Kong ldquoso prosperous.In an op-ed in last weeks FT, Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, called the Chinese regime ldquoan enemy of open societies everywhere and laid out what he saw as the profound economic implications of Chinarsquos policy.ldquoIf China destroys the rule of law in Hong Kong it will ruin the cityrsquos chances of continuing to be a great international financial hub that mediates about two-thirds of the direct investment in and out of China, wrote Patten, before urging Britain and its partners in the Group of Seven nations ndash which will convene virtually next month ndash to take a stand against the Chinese regime.The question of whether China will heed such a global stand, however, remains to be seen. Some analysts warn that Beijing, emboldened by a nationalist agenda under president Xi Jinping and a worldwide backlash from the spread of Covid- from Wuhan, might well be willing to use Hong Kong as a battlefield in a new Cold War with the West.Such a view sees Hong Kong, China, and the West entangled in a vicious political cycle, potentially for years to come. Much, of course, will depend on the reaction of the seven million or so people who inhabit Hong Kong.ldquoImmediately, turmoil at local level is almost certain, says Brian CH Fong, a Hong Kong-based political scientist who has founded and leads several civil society organisation in the city.ldquoThe democracy camp will certainly resist the national security law and the lsquoparamilitary police statersquo, backed by the Hong Kong government, and Beijing will respond with more aggressive oppression, Fong told the online international news magazine The Diplomat last week.ldquoNew waves of street fights will happen from now on all the way through the anniversaries of key dates of the lsquo Water revolutionrsquo such as the June  resistance and August  attacks, Fong added.If the early protests on the streets last week were anything to go by then Fongrsquos assessment so far is correct. In aof the unrest that roiled Hong Kong last year, crowds thronged the cityrsquos Causeway Bay shopping area in defiance.Many describe the mood among young Hong Kongers, who largely do not identy as Chinese, as being grim.The slogan ldquolaam caau ndash loosely translated as ldquo we burn, you burn with us ndash has become popular.Hong Kong police fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse thousands of people as chants of ldquoHong Kong independence, the only way out echoed through the streets.Protest organisers on social media urged people to ldquobe water and keep moving throughout the city.On LIHKG, an online forum popular with protesters, users called for a ldquohundred-day war to take advantage of their last opportunity to protest before the laws come into force. ldquoSay no to China, one posted.Many of those on the streets again now have been involved in previous protests and fear that the new law will also be used to punish them for such activism.ldquoI am worried that after the implementation of the national security law, they will go after those being charged before and the police will be further out of control, said Twinnie, a secondary school student who spoke to the Reuters news agency but declined to give her last name.ldquoI am afraid of being arrested but I still need to come out and protest for the future of Hong Kong, she added. Such feelings, according to other reports, are a common refrain among the protesters.ldquoIrsquove come for something I care deeply about ndash ultimately itrsquos freedom, said a -year-old lawyer who also wished to remain anonymous, citing the national security laws, Beijing encroachment, and a recent report clearing police of wrongdoing.ldquoIf we keep quiet, they can get away with it. I donrsquot think we can change things but need to make sure our voices are heard, he told reporters.Crucial as the voices and actions on the cityrsquos streets are to Hong Kongrsquos future, it is those in global diplomatic circles that will greatly determine how this latest episode in the cityrsquos recent tortured political existence will ultimately play out.Most eyes are on Washington, which under the administration of President Donald Trump, has been at increasing loggerheads with Beijing even before this latest crisis and the outbreak of coronavirus.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wasted no time in making clear that with Beijingrsquos move on the national security law, Hong Kong could no longer be considered a meaningfully autonomous territory.ldquoNo reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground, Pompeo said in a statement.Put another way it could mean that the removal of Hong Kongrsquos special status could lead Washington to treat it like any other Chinese city. That would mean higher tarfs, including those enacted amid the trade war between the US and China.To say that businesses are nervous would be an understatement. Currently trade between the US and Hong Kong is estimated at  billion a year. Almost  US companies base their regional headquarters in Hong Kong and more than , have operations in the city, from M to Goldman Sachs to the insurer AIG.The US State Department also estimates that , US citizens reside in Hong Kong.All this, of course, is a double-edged sword given that the Chinese regime would also desperately need economic stability to shore up its political support in the city without which it would be more vulnerable to US pressure.ldquoIf the United States wanted to ensure that Beijing gets the raw end of this deal, so that they felt some pain, restricting Hong Kongrsquos ability to act as a global financial centre would be the way to do it, said George Magnus, an expert on the Chinese economy at the University of Oxford.ldquoIrsquom not saying it would be a good thing, butyoursquore in a financial war, thatrsquos the way to do it, Magnus told Foreign Policy magazine a few days ago.But as the same article also pointed out, other experts believe that rather than the US trying to use Hong Kong to open up a new front in the showdown against Beijing, it is instead merely trying to preserve Hong Kongrsquos independence and relative freedoms as best it can.With relations between Washington and Beijing already strained to say the least the US might simply use warning shots to pull the Chinese back from an all-out crackdown on Hong Kongrsquos protesters.For its part, China insists it is not trying to pick a fight with the US or anyone . But the war of words is far from pretty,Responding recently to US criticism over the spread of coronavirus, Wang Yi, who some have now dubbed Chinarsquos ldquowolf warrior foreign minister, hit back strongly at the Trump administration.There was a ldquopolitical virus spreading in Washington, insisted Yi, one that was pushing the two countries ldquoto the brink of a new Cold War.Such tough talking is sure to focus the minds of those in the West formulating a diplomatic response to the Hong Kong crisis, just as the presence of some , troops from Chinarsquos Peoplersquos Liberation Army garrisoned on the cityrsquos outskirts will do the same for its citizens.Only last week its commander said they stood ready to ldquosafeguard Chinese sovereignty and support the national security laws.As Bonnie Glaser of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies summed up the standoff in Foreign Policy magazine: ldquoI donrsquot think therersquos any real happy ending hellip but there are worst cases and there are less-than-worst cases.Now some seven million Hong Kong citizens can only watch and wait nervously as their city is caught in this global geopolitical crossfire.The standoff over the cityrsquos status and future will undoubtedly serve as a test for whether China will continue to honour its international pledges.It was back in  that China made clear its goal of being at least on equal terms economically with the US with a view to overtaking it in the future.Many saw it as pivotal turning point in terms of the countryrsquos domestic and international policies.Curiously enough it was that same year that Wolf Warrior  became a blockbuster movie success in the country.Since then, Beijingrsquos wolf warrior diplomacy has certainly made its mark. Hong Kong is now set to be another major litmus test of just how far China is prepared to go in pushing it."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : pmA police cordon is in place on Crowness Crescent, Hatston, this evening, Saturday.

However, we are asking you, for now, to please stay within, or close to, your own local area. And don’t use public transport unless it is absolutely necessary.”The first steps out of lockdown could only involve “careful and cautious” changes, she said.In Orkney, this means that travel on public bus and inter-island ferry and air services will continue to be for essential reasons only during Phase One, with passenger numbers severely restricted as a result of and in line with social distancing requirements.Across Scotland it is assessed that social distancing will reduce transport capacity by  per cent –  per cent and this figure is very much in line with the assessment in Orkney for our ferries and local bus services.During Phase One, there will be no changes to the current timetables for local bus, ferry and inter-island air services.For Orkney Ferries, the aim is to help protect residents in the isles from the risk of infection – along with the crews who operate the service – and to ensure that the ferries can continue to run and deliver freight and other essential supplies.The Scottish Government’s new guidance, published on Tuesday , will help public transport operators and passengers prepare for the further lting of lockdown restrictions at a future date.Detailed information from the government on the newly announced Public Transport Guidance has been sent to the council. Careful consideration is being given to how this might apply locally when the move to Phase Two begins.The guidance does state that people should wear face coverings when using public transport and further information on the council’s expectations on this will be provided in due course.The government has acknowledged that there will be geographic challenges in implementing the guidance and that there can be no ‘one size fits all’ to the approach taken across Scotland.The government’s latest travel advice is available here: https:www.transport.gov.scot coronavirus-covid- transport-transition-plan advice-on-how-to-travel-safely copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We remain committed to supporting the work of the management group to co-ordinate a range of goose management measures as soon as feasibly possible.”Alan Corrigall, Orkney NFU Scotland chairman said: “We are disappointed that the momentum which had been gathering to find new ways to control the resident geese population has come to a halt.  However, hopefully marksmen shooting later this summer can still go ahead as planned, and the other agreed control measures can be trialled next year.”Land managers can still control greylag geese under the General Licence to prevent agricultural damage, provided they can comply with the Government’s COVID- restriction rules. The General Licence was amended this year so inidual licences to carry out shooting or egg oiling during closed season are no longer required.Greylag goose meat sales have also been consented under a General Licence for Orkney. As a result, land managers on Orkney can now, under food hygiene legislation, sell the greylag goose carcasses they generate,they are satisfied they comply with the COVID- suppression rules.

The armed forces have been helping out across the UK building emergency hospitals, delivering vital supplies and much more. UK government staff based all across the world have also been helping UK citizens to get home to the UK during the global Coronavirus outbreak. Today we look at how members of Government departments have been helping solve some of the problems created by the Coronavirus outbreak.On March , the Defence Secretary announced a COVID Support Force to assist public services with their response to the coronavirus outbreak. There were , Armed Forces personnel stood at readiness to assist civil authorities, of which nearly , have already been deployed.Military reservists have also been mobilised as part of the COVID Support Force and used in a range of activities, from providing medical and logistical support to deploying their own professional skills, such as accounting and construction.The help from the UK’s armed forces during the Coronavirus outbreak has taken a number of dferent forms. The Armed Forces have deployed dozens of military planners across the UK, which has seen them working with Local Resilience Forums and Partnerships, alongside the Emergency Co-ordination Centres in Scotland and Wales supporting public services, local authorities and emergency services.The UK Armed Forces’ efforts have included working with specialists from Boots Pharmacists to train testing personnel, the provision of military testers to regional testing centres and the delivery of vital testing equipment. Military personnel are also currently working to distribute PPE to NHS trusts and organisations across the country.Up to May , Armed Forces personnel had helped to deliver over . billion items of PPE to NHS staff in England. Six military specialists have also been deployed to assist NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde with the fitting of FFP face masks.A new COVID Aviation Task Force has been established. This includes two RAF Puma based in Kinloss Barracks to help the NHS in Scotland and Northern England.Support has included training key workers in ious locations around the Western Hebrides in medical evacuation procedures and supporting NHS staff, plus helping with five medical evacuations in England and Scotland.More than , British travellers have ed to the UK on  special Government charter flights from  dferent countries and territories since the outbreak of coronavirus.Foreign and Commonwealth Office staff have been working around the clock with the airline industry and host governments across the world to help bring back British travellers.Up to £ million has been made available for special charter flights to priority countries, focused on helping the most vulnerable travellers.So far, charter flights have ed British nationals to the UK from countries ranging from Bolivia to Bermuda and New Zealand to Nepal., passengers who have ed from Spain.Around  British nationals have ed from Kenya on five commercial flights, which would not have been possible without the work of our High Commission in Nairobi.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has also helped more than , British passengers who were aboard  cruise ships disembark.A package of measures to support British nationals who are still waiting toto the UK has also been put in place.The support package addresses financial issues, healthcare concerns and visa extensions, as well as loans for those who cannot afford flights to the UK where they have exhausted all other options.The Department for International Developmentleads the UK’s work to end extreme poverty.The UK is an international development superpower, and we are also a scientic and medical world leader. UK-based scientists, such as those at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine are playing key roles in the global response to this deadly new virus.Through the DFID aid budget, the UK is the largest single national contributor to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations international efforts to find a vaccine. Through this fund, we are working to improve our understanding of the virus and to support scientists around the globe – CEPI is already backing nine potential vaccines.Once a vaccine is found, delivering it globally will be the next big challenge. To help that, the Government has invested the equivalent of £ million a year for the next five years in Gavi, the global vaccine alliance that delivers vaccines in  of the poorest countries around the world.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From the inability to spend time with family and friends to the impact on businesses, the effect has been profound and far-reaching.  Thanks to those efforts, however, we have seen a downward trend in new cases of infection that has enabled the Scottish Government to begin easing restrictions.“Despite this initial relaxation of the rules, however, I was pleased to hear the First Minister reiterate that travelling to the islands, other than in exceptional circumstances, is still not possible for now.  It is a dficult message, but absolutely the right one at this time.“We know that many people across the UK, and further afield, look forward to visiting Orkney at this time of year.  However, the safety of our community remains paramount and there is still some way to go before we can begin welcoming visitors again.“The First Minister’s message though is a reminder of the signicant economic impact that the shutdown of the tourism sector has on Orkney.  The grant support provided by the UK and Scottish governments to mitigate this impact has been welcome, but too many local businesses still find they are falling between the cracks.“I will continue to work with Ministers to ensure that gaps in support are closed.  Meantime, I would urge the public to keep following the advice of the government and hopefully it won’t be long before we can look forward to visitors ing to Orkney”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We ask those who are local to beaches to continue to be aware of the inherent dangers and to avoid taking risks. Our strong advice to the Scottish public, who are not local to a beach, is to exercise locally and not to travel to the coast.#Scotland’s air temperature may be warming up but the sea temperature remains consistently chilly all year, jumping or falling into cold water or spending longer periods than normal submerged in the water can lead to, potentially fatal, cold water shock.”Michael Avril, Scotland’s water safety lead for the RNLI and chair of Water Safety Scotland said: “The Scottish public need to remember the following safety advice: Stay in familiar surroundings,follow Scottish Government advice of remaining within five miles of your home, don’t put yourself, your family and emergency services at risk by taking risks or assuming it ‘won’t happen to you’. If you do see someone at risk call  and ask for the Coastguard.”The message from the RNLI in Scotland is clear, an easing of lockdown does not mean an instantly safer coast and water temperatures remain dangerously cold.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now, why does not Nicola change the dictate for Shetland  We would love to sunbath also, between the snow showers!!!!!😂😂😂😂How fortunate that the Scottish, Welsh and Irish leaders are maintaining their more sensible , balanced and wary approaches .Enlighten us Haydn, why is the infection rate lowerin England than in Wales and Scotland  I for one am not the least confused by the messages, just what is confusing you She niver agrees wIth what the rest off the UK IS DOINGBruce, you make it look asNicola, is acting like a Tory##..The Tory policy being##..me, me, me and melolSince you appear to not know, there has been confusion in Britain today about the actual meaning of BoJo’s statement yesterdayand , as I write, he is trying to explain himself away on TV. THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s.

That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.All I am suggesting Peter is an attempt to control excessive eating of Junk foodswith integrating our NHH with free access to all to a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Just how can that be #to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming. #Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  If Ian imagines free education and access to the NHS has equalled le chances this is going to be a walk in the park.If Ian imagines the Welfare State to be thriving why so many Foodbanks  On another planet does not just describe Boris and Dodgy Dom today.There are also undernourished children in Shetland and across the UK, and parents going without in order that their children can eat. Ian might be interested to research the number of food banks before the era of Conservstive austerity and see how well the number has grown since. Quite an achievement for his #thriving welfare state#. Soon unemployment numbers will be thriving too thanks to the ghastly response to Covid  fromBoris and chumsThirty thousand deaths a year is a pre-covid figure we now have obesity as a % factor in covid  deaths!!If we were talking drug deaths running a food bank would be an offence. Perhaps that is a little tongue-in-cheek but this year obesity will be a factor in about , people dying prematurely. Surely about time for gyms, fitness and participant sports organisationsto be granted by integrated into the NHS with a free or subsidised entry for all.Sorry Peter, Boris and his chums were working with Nicola and her chums on Covid  . All in harmony which must be a first!Covid  was away with the fairies, another socialist ideal.!It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head. The statistics are not clearly put and blaming one UK politician, BoJo or Sturgeon is wrong. The SNP and Torie parties pretty much followed identical policies until last week.If Ian imagines free education has eliminated inequalities of opportunity he is mistaken.inequalities of opportunity frequently come down to ambition. The opportunities are there for all, not everybody wishes to take them.Sure good sound parentage and background help promote ambition, but the old adage you can take a horse to water but!!! If you wish to destroy ambition, try extreme socialism. The good old USSR and present-day Venezuela give good examples.I don#t know where to start with this statement Ian, and I#m not sure it will make any dference to youI do.There are multiple stories on just this very subject, but since you are not a big fan of the arts, you might not have read them, seen them or heard them.You can have ambition, and even a great education, but still be knocked back by the old boy network, or because you are not white or not male. These inequalities still exist.There are statistics to show that Eton boys get the top jobs still, and the only way to get a better leader for this country will be to do away with privilege and try to level the playing field. New Zealand for example have a great leader and it is refreshing to see someone lead who has her role on merit.I know nothing of the countries you mention but I am sure they still have ambitious and educated people despite your partisan viewpoint.Well it’s a surprise to see that the Scottish government aren’t being blamed for poverty and suffering this time # turns out it was the underprivileged’s own fault all along. I’m sure a sharp word will snap them out of it and everyone will be a CEO or a government advisor in no time. Just need to put the effort in old boy what what! I’d always thought the morally bereft who profit from misery and desperation who have a lot to do with keeping the poor poor have a lot to answer for though you know payday lenders, gambling companies, private dentists with a monopoly#Ian might as well say the poor are frequently to blame for their lot. Oil rich Norway does not tolerate UK levels of inequality.Neither do many other poprer countries.Quite what the USSR and Venesuala have got to do with it is likely apparent to Ian.Others will see their inclusion within what passes for his argument as a clear attempt at distraction. The possible impacts of being brought up in poverty by others who have had the same dficulties are many.The opportunities for such children are not easily compared to, say, those enjoyed by the young Boris Johnson.Ian is again indulging himself in victim blaming.UK policy has not set out to create level playing fields for socio-econmic participation. It should, but won#t for as long as #One Nation# English Conservatives like Boris Johnson continue to serve the interests of those of Ian Tinkler#s outlook over those of all. On th of May Ian described intergenerational deprivation as #relevant to Victorian times#.NY pretending ambition alone can help all children born into poverty to escape it Ian is demonstrating Victorian attitudes of his own. Seven year olds brought up in bedsits should choose better parental lestyles.I was unaware Thatcher, Blair, Cummings, Callahan, Wilson et all went to Eton. Mind you, Tony Ben, Sir Antony no less went to Westminster college!!!! Quite what that has to do #With the price of tea in China # rather like your former comments, escapes me!Johan, Ian#s not just a contrarian, compelled to rile others, but does so to share his quite unpleasant world-view. He talks of intergenerational deprivation as being a #very trendy left-wing academic hypothesis, relevant to Victorian times# but it#s a known fact that many a bairn raised in poverty, enjoying few opportinities will go on to live in poverty and have few opportunities. If they become parents, the likelihood of their bairns being able to do better lessens generation by generation without purposeful government action designed to level the playing field.The concept used here is social mobility and many governments globally take pains to increase it. Where those with disadvantageous starts in le go on, on average, to do better than their parents,social mobility is high. Where their lot is likely to be fixed at birth social mobility is low. Scotland has a long running research project to monitor it. In addition to the factors you cite, cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence as well as other non-lestyle factors. Ian knows obesity can have complex causes, but doesn#t care. Its quite tragic.Poor parenting is really not a class thing whatever are trendy humanist academics may say. Just feeble attempts to justy socialist ideals. However, that has nothing to do with my attempt to deal with excess fat and obesity., #cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug-dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence. # Well apart from the semi-literate bit that sounds a little bit like an Etonian upbringing, so typical of the Aristocracy!!! I love the bit about #Scotland has a long-running research project to monitor it.# .What a shame it is run by a load of left-wing academics, perhaps that is why Scotland#s performance falls so far short of England#s with regard to social mobility!! As for the complex causes of obesity, it is really simple Peter, it is not even class-related. It is simply eating more than food than your body needs. Whatever socio-psychological hogwash you may spout, in the final analysis, comes down to eating too much. It is that simple.So for you, the uneven distribution is simply bad parenting choices. This is of course #socio-psychological hogwash# of your own. Perhaps you could cite a peer reviewed study in a reputable publication to back this claim up Who might spend more time with their kids: a stay at home mum whose husband is a stockbroker, or a single mum working three jobs on zero hours contracts .."},{"url":null,"title":"calls to save shetland tourism industry with 12 month covid 19 support package ","story":"Shetland politicians and business leaders are ramping up pressure on governments to provide better support for the struggling tourism industry during the Covid- crisis – and beyond.MSP Beatrice Wishart has added her voice to the growing chorus of calls pushing for the UK and Scottish governments to help the hospitality businesses survive.Ms Wishart#s calls for a -month support plan for the industry follow comments made by isles MP Alistair Carmichael in Westminster earlier this week.At a meeting in Holyrood, Ms Wishart said tourism businesses might survive  just three months without support.She asked tourism secretary Fergus Ewing about working with the UK government to consider a -month support package to tide the tourism and hospitality sector over into next season.Ms Wishart was told the problems had been recognised problems but a -month fund had not yet been considered.After the meeting she said: “In Shetland the tourism season is shorter compared to other areas of the UK. It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

Much of her adult le was spent in Lanarkshire, though she remained a frequent visitor to Skye, and was last on the island just three years ago.She said she continued to keep up with events in Skye by reading the West Highland Free Press every week.Mrs Parker’s son, Phil Dibdin, said his mother’s piano playing had lted everyone#s spirits in the home.“They are really well looked after in there. There was always something going on like bingo, quizzes, visits from school children and church services.“Now all of that has stopped because of the virus, and visits are restricted to talking through the window.“It’s been a great thing to see her at the piano.”Charles Delaney, manager of McClymont House, said Mrs Parker’s piano playing was a “great news story” at a time when many care homes are in the spotlight for much more sombre reasons.“She is a remarkable, inspiring woman who offers hope,” he added. “She is showing that older people in care homes still have le in them, and they can still make a contribution for their families and for the wider community as well.”Money raised by Mrs Parker will be given to the Lanarkshire Health Board Endowment Fund which invests donations to improve patient’s health.

Despite this, a few years later I obtained an English degree, and I seem to be able to string a sentence together for this column…I have run an outdoor centre for  years, and while never making it as a musicianmy love of music and the arts has remained and hopefully has helped Anne in her professional career.I still occasionally pick up the bass, and I can scratch a half decent tune out on the fiddle.At school I never got beyond three blind mice on the recorder.When my kids were  and , we took them round the world for  months, visiting India, Australia, Fiji and America # my mantra being Mark Twain#s quote #Never let schooling get in the way of a good education.#Schooling has now however suddenly got very dferent.In the past weeks and months children have been taught at home via the Internet.Teachers have transferred the blackboard to the screen, and the kitchen table has become the classroom.While before some pupils emailed their homework in, now it is all emailed, all homework.Of course this has presented challenges, frustrations, inequalities, just like traditional schooling.Some young people engage well, others not. Some teachers engage well, others not. Just like traditional schooling.The talk and plan is that schools will reopen physically after summer, possibly and probably in a very dferent manner.It seems however, that there is a rush to adapt an old norm to a new unknown reality.This is understandable, as change is always uncertain, and it is safe to stick with what you know, but perhaps we will be missing an opportunity to create a new reality.Begin afresh with a blank piece of paper.If our best creative thinkers were asked to make a framework for educating young people, starting with that blank sheet of paper, with today’s technologies would they build the institutions we have today Would they build a school Perhaps it would be unfair on the classes of  or  and further, to experiment with them and their futures, so undoubtedly things will be kept as normal as possible. But with curriculum change and continual development flux is nothing unusual.There have been plenty experiments in the past.It is already quite radical to have suggested staggered start times, blended learning and a concentration on screen contact.Perhaps national exam level provision could develop into a drop-in style of tutorial seminar-based provision, where a school is a resource to be used as required, and not attended per se.Perhaps the new normal could have place-centred outdoor learning as its core.I heard one teacher complain on the radio, “we are educationalists, not child minders”.There seems to be a blurring between parenting, social work and education, and schools appear to be being used as a solution to all societies’ ills, becoming all things to all people.The role that schools have played over and above teaching has become evident during Covid and lockdown as parents have had to look after their children continuously.Situations are all unique, and there will have been a whole spectrum from embraced appropriate enjoyable home learning, to dysal chaos.Most families have probably been somewhere in the middle, but sadly in some cases schools have had to continue providing a haven for vulnerable children.Most importantly there is “NoWrongPath” even more so today when destinations may be more uncertain.Resilience, empathy, creativity and integrity will be what our children need in the future.I think the class of  will be fine, they have had a unique experience which will help make them who they will become.Travel is likely to be harder in the near future, how easy it would be to take a family around the world or ride a motorbike a long distance for a gap year is debatable, but there will always be opportunity for experiential adventure.Routes back into traditional education are always available, perhaps even more so now.I suspect universities will be desperate for students, and will be creating access courses to enable those with uncertain schooling certicates.When I was caught ‘skiving’ PEI had no idea I would end up running an outdoor activity centre.When I was failing physics A Level at school, I had no idea I would end up with a Masters degree from Edinburgh University.While the First Law of Thermodynamicsis a crucial and fabulous bit of knowledge, it probably isn’t what helped me when my motorbike gearbox broke in Jericho.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3134145.jpg--.jpg?1590072730000\n","title":"wrightbus announces redundancies as it looks to secure its future","story":"Bus manufacturer Wrightbus has today announced a number of redundancies at its factory in Ballymena as it looks to create a stable and secure future for the company in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Chief Executive Buta Atwal said the tough decision has been taken to make up to  permanent employees redundant pending consultation, as well as a reduction in agency staff of up to  workers over a phased period that will be kept under review. The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly. Our vision is to have , people working for us by the end of  and we hope to be in a position to re-hire some of those who have been made redundant.“We believe green fuel is the future and will bring a brighter future to Northern Ireland over the coming years.”A consultation will begin with staff on Monday, May , and Wrightbus will be supporting staff throughout the process, eventhis has to be done virtually due to current Government guidelines.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers. Every job lost is a heavy blow for the inidual concerned, their household, the wider community and economy – especially in the face of the current Covid- pandemic.“Ahead of this announcement being made, I spoke to senior management to call on them to utilise the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme to protect jobs and retain skilled workers the prospect of workers being thrown onto the dole queues at this time is unacceptable.“Management confirmed they will be proceeding to a -day consultative period on their proposals but that they will consider furlough as an option. They sought to reassure us of their ambitions for Wrightbus in Ballymena and its centrality to their plans.“Instead of reducing employment, we need to ramp up production of hydrogen-buses to curb greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more environmentally-sustainable economy. “The Wrightbus workforce is perfectly positioned to make a vital contribution to that they have the skills to build the buses at the heart of any future green transport policy.“The request for furlough will be top of Unite’s agenda in the consultation process.

Having grown up in the era when the river was dominated by the huge red brick edice of the Braidwater Mill, Rodney points out that its path is more exposed to public view than ever. “When you look back, it was pretty much enclosed space from McNinch Footbridge to Harryville Bridge.  “People had no reason to be in that area unless they were mill workers.“Nowadays we have great views right along this section and I personally feel that there has to be a joined up approach to making full use of this fantastic potential.“With the opening of the retail park it has now opened the area up to everyone and the nature and beauty around the river with wildle such as swans, ducks, otters, kingfishers and other wildle regularly seen on the stretch from Sainsbury’s down to Harryville bridge,” he said. But he acknowledges that not not everyone will see the beauty associated with the area. “There will always be some who will still treat it as a dumping ground and continue to put the wildle and the environment at risk by dumping their refuse into the river. “These people need to be told in no uncertain terms that this will not be lolerated by the local community - we have the ability to impose fines on those who continually flaunt regulations and I would call for such monetary penalties to be used more frequently.”But Rodney beleives the real driving force behind the naural rejuvenation of the area must comes as a united push.“ I feel that the authorities responsible for this area and the retail park owner have to take seriously the issues associated with this stretch of water and listen to the concerns of the community groups and members of the public who regularly use the pathways around the river for daily exercise.“My opinion is that things weren’t thought through properly at the outset and the environmental issues weren’t taken into account when the retail park was being planned. “The aim now should be to preserve the beauty of this stretch of the river Braid and that means taking steps to make sure this happens.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3138061.jpg--.jpg?1590480464000\n","title":"opinion moral necessity to support local business in post virus world","story":"By the Very Rev Dr Norman Hamilton OBEThese last weeks have seen contrasting trends as we battle with coronavirus. On the one hand we have come together in our communityto clap for carers on a Thursday evening, and to make ‘scrubs’ for those in the front line of care in the NHS and in care homes. But with most of our local shops, family businesses and services closed, we have also looked to multinational companies and the big supermarket chains to provide us with what we need . They have done much for which we must be genuinely grateful – perhaps best shown in the huge effort to deliver groceries to homes where people are vulnerable. And many companies have prospered. For example in mid April, Jeff Bezos who is the founder and boss of Amazon, saw his personal wealth swell by pound billionafter soaring demand for online shopping sent the firms share price to a new high. This cemented his position as the worlds richest man with a fortune of well over pound billion. As they say – it is an ill wind that blows no one any good. PATTERNSThese changed patterns of le – evident community spirit and massively increased internet shopping – will bring big moral dilemmas when the pandemic is under control and some degree of normality s. Will community spirit be relegated to the back benches by the need for so many of us to rebuild the patterns of our own everyday lives  And crucially, will we have become so content with buying on-line and having the parcel delivered to our front door, that we will be less committed to buying locally, and supporting local business  I must confess to having real fears on both questions. When the focus moves away from carers and the NHS, what community need will fill the gap  It is very dficult to think of an example which affects every one of us, and to which we can bring such loyalty. And will the obvious convenience of having that parcel delivered to our front door be set aside to go shopping locally on a cold November morning or a wet February afternoon Personally I feel that it is a moral necessity to support our local businesses and shops as best we can – evenit costs a little more to do so. They of course will be well aware of the threat from the big international companies, and must play their part in quality of service and show the ‘personal touch’ that will make it attractive to do business with them in its own right. And there would be a great added bonus that such support on an ongoing basis would be a quite new and important expression of community spirit.I have absolutely no dficulty with the owner of Amazon seeing new opportunities to expand his business. But I have real dficultyordinary citizens like myself in our local area see it as acceptable to give his company so much of our limited income that many of the businesses in our neighbourhood go into serious decline. The Biblical command to ‘love your neighbour as yourself’ has a new and crucially important relevance.

There will be thousands of job losses, he said.I#ll be proposing that a task force is set up to focus on how best we get the city back up and running. I#d like to see a memorial built to all those who have lost their lives from Covid-.In an exclusive interview with the Belfast , the next Lord Mayor talked about being the first single dad in the job.The SDLP is set to nominate its poll-topping Ardoyne councillor, Paul McCusker, as Deputy Lord Mayor. A nurse in the Mater Hospital, he is a community activist known for his work with the homeless.Covid- will make Monday#s mayoral installation ceremony very dferent from those in previous years. Social distancing means there can#t be a full meeting of all  councillors. Instead, each party will nominate a small number of representatives to attend.The practice of the outgoing Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor placing the chain of office around the shoulders of their successors will be suspended.Mr McCoubrey succeeds Sinn Fein#s Danny Baker and Mr McCusker takes over from Alliance#s Peter McReynolds.The next Lord Mayor hopes that, despite the restrictions, his mother and five children can watch proceedings from the public gallery in City Hall.Mr McCoubrey will also not have the crowded diary of public engagements that usually awaits new Lord Mayors. It#s very frustrating, he said. Once restrictions ease, I want to be out thanking our NHS and care workers, and those who have been delivering food parcels to the old and vulnerable.Mr McCoubrey, who has been a councillor for  years, said his working-class roots would be to the fore during his mayoralty.I grew up in Springmartin and I still live there. We had nothing. We were no dferent from the people in Springhill across the peace line. I#m a proud unionist but I want to be a Lord Mayor for the people of Springmartin, Springhill and all in this city, whatever their politics.Asked about his attitude to gay marriage, which his party opposes, he said: Same-sex marriage is legal here, and I#ve always taken the approach of live and let live. As Lord Mayor I want everyone to feel welcome in this city regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation.Mr McCoubrey was first elected as a councillor for the Ulster Democratic Party , the UDA#s political wing. He joined the DUP in . When I walked into City Hall in , I was totally overwhelmed. I was the youngest councillor there and the sole UDP one. I went in as a super-Prod from the Shankill, determined to fly the flag high. I#ve learned a lot over the years.In those early days Sinn Fein councillors Fra McCann and Tom Hartley would sit down for a chat. They represented areas with the same problems as mine. Sinn Fein members in City Hall fought tooth and nail for everything they#ve achieved for their communities. Nothing was given to them. I decided to do the same for mine, evenit meant being a thorn in the side of the council establishment.Mr McCoubrey said he#d joined the UDP because the mainstream unionist parties felt remote to someone from my class. He said: I knew it was the political wing of a paramilitary organisation but it was trying to bring peace and stability to the community, and I was up for that.Askedhe was a UDA member andhe condemns its terror campaign, he said: I was never in the UDA. I condemn every murder in Northern Ireland. They were all wrong. None were, or can, be justied.Mr McCoubrey#s term of office as deputy mayor in  was marred when he shared a  with UDA members Johnny Adair and Michael Stone at a loyalist culture day event on the Shankill, which ended with masked men firing shots in the air. He said: Had I known what would happen, I#d not have been on that stage. Things spiralled out of control and I was caught in the middle of it.I remember at the next council meeting, the Sinn Fein group leader got up and said, #I#ve no doubt the deputy lord mayor is a reasonable person but...# and I was bombarded with criticism. Every nationalist councillor wanted me removed.I continued in office but it left a very sour taste for the Catholic community. Had I been able to turn the clock back, I#d have done it in a heartbeat.Mr McCoubreygrew up the eldest in a family of four in Springmartin. His mother was a guide helping on buses taking disabled children to school in west Belfast. His father, who was a fitter in Belfast Gasworks, fell to his death from a roof when Mr McCoubrey was .A lot of responsibility landed on my shoulders, he said. I had just started working as a painter and decorator and I did as much overtime as I could get to help pay the bills. My mum took a second job in the Royal Victoria Hospital laundry as well. Times were tough.Mr McCoubrey has three grown-up children from his first marriage. He has brought up his two sons, Frankand Kyle , as a single dad since his second marriage broke up over a decade ago. It was a steep learning curve for me but I#ve now perfected my cooking, cleaning and ironing skills, he joked.Some times of the year were hard - putting the boys to bed on Christmas Eve and knowing they wouldn#t have two parents there in the morning like most other kids. But summers were always great. I#d a caravan in Portrush and we#d head down there for weekends of fishing, walking on the beach, and Barry#s.The boys are my best friends. I was offered the Lord Mayor#s position four years ago but didn#t take it because they were too young.They don#t need me just as much now. They#re so excited about me becoming Lord Mayor. It#s been a battle getting them to keep it a secret and not tell their mates.Last September, Frank Jnr was the victim of a sectarian hate crime when he was beaten up by nationalist youths as he walked home from school.I was cooking dinner and he walked in, bleeding, bruised and shaking. His jaw was broken. I was devastated. I#ve brought both my boys up to not care about somebody#s religion and I didn#t want this to change them.That night, Arlene [Foster] visited us. She sat with Frank and told him that he must rise above the assault and not let it poison his mind.Mr McCoubrey said the attack had knocked the stuffing out of his son. He played football for Berlin Swts but he hasn#t been back since, and he#s in counselling. But we got phone calls and #get well# cards from right across the community, including from Sinn Fein people, and that was a big help. I want to build on that cross-community spirit as Lord Mayor.

Adhering to social distancing, they have been going door-to-door to capture portraits of families going about their daily lives under the extraordinary circumstances. Trevor Benson, who has been taking photographs of residents in Castledawson, said the reaction to the project has been very positive. He said: “People have been contacting asking ‘what time are you going to be up round this way ’ or ‘are you going to do our area ’ so it’s been good. “They have been sitting waiting, some at the windows or on the doorstep. I think it’s just giving them something to look back on. googletag.cmd.push “Some have said they’ll save it on Facebook and they’ll get a memory every year about it.” Much like the pandemic that inspired it, the project has taken on a worldwide appeal, with Kilrea photographer Carol McLaughlin first seeing it mentioned in America. “A girl from America, I think, started the idea of the doorstep project,” she said. “I’m in a group on Facebook called ‘Women in Photography’ and people said they were doing it in their areas, so I thought it would be really nice to do in our town. “I put a message up on my personal page because more people in the town would be on it, and got a really good response, so we went for it.” googletag.cmd.push As well as providing a record for future generations of what le was like during the  pandemic, the project has helped people to feel connected at a time when distance is in vogue. Photographing in Magherafelt, Joseph Cullen said the idea of connecting people really appealed to him. “A lady contacted me saying she was in England and she hasn’t seen her parents in Magherafelt since January and she was heartbroken about that. “They’re not very good at technology, so I went to their estate and took a nice photograph of them and recorded a video message from her parents to her in England. “It gave them a real sense of things going back to normal and being able to see them again. To be able to do that for people is brilliant.” Re-creating that feeling of connection for older people without access to social media led to John O’Neill going a step further. The Ballinderry photographer reached out specically to the village’s elderly population, with the help of some comprehensive local knowledge. “The third photograph in was Charlie Collins, who had a list made out of  people in the parish who were over , so it went on a bit from there,” he said. “I would say I was calling in an area on a certain day and people would get in contact. I arranged rough times that I would call so they were watching or a family member was keeping an eye out. “They were contacting me looking photos done. Because it was creating a buzz, I was getting phone calls from people not on social media. “A lady beside me said her phone lit up the next day and she was entertained all day by people phoning, saying they had seen her photograph on Facebook, so that was lovely. “They are sitting in the house on their own and a bit of a conversation on the phone was keeping the boredom at bay.” In keeping with the Loughshore parish’s unique character, local residents made sure to put their own spin on their portraits. “The black and white seemed to work well for the older generation. Some of them were putting their stamp on it,they were known for something or were a bit of a character,” said John. “I did Patrick McGuckin’s on Saturday evening and I jokingly said to one boy’ ‘I’ve to go up here and get Patrick and the we’s photo’ and he said, ‘I hope he’s on the sit-on lawnmower’. “Patrick cuts the football field, and sure as could be, Patrick was on the sit-on lawnmower whenever I went up! “There was the odd one needed a wee warning to get spruced up and that’s why I put the call out. They don’t want to be caught short – especially with no hairdressers at the minute!” With reasons to get dressed up currently at a premium, residents of all four areas took the opportunity to don the glad rags, with some going to extreme s. “In one family, the dad came out with make-up on and he was dressed up as a princess – clearly that’s what he’s been doing with his daughter in isolation!” said Carol McLaughlin. “There were a few that threw on a bit of tan and got dolled up. I had said to come whatever way they wanted, so they could get dolled up or come out in their jammies – whatever way they normally spend their days.” Joseph Cullen, who is a member of Mid Ulster Photography Club along with Trevor Benson, said the residents of Magherafelt were also keen to impress. “Sometimes, everyone is dolled up to the nines, has their hair done and are in their best Sunday outfits,” he said. “We’ve had kids getting dressed up in superhero outfits and that kind of stuff. One family all wore matching outfits and some have got their pets involved.” With Covid- affecting work for photographers everywhere, all four that we spoke to were delighted to get out and about and taking pictures again. “My daughter came out with me and we went round the town for three days,” said Carol McLaughlin. “It actually worked out really well, and we got good weather, which helped. It was so nice getting back out with the camera again. “It was a nice, community thing to do. Everybody got involved and it was lovely to see it all at the end – everyone’s pictures of their time in isolation. “What made me want to do it was that it was a moment in history. It will always bring people back to that crazy time when we were all stuck indoors.” In the nostalgia-fuelled reminiscence of le under lockdown, Joseph Cullen feels traditional photography can play a role in preserving memories of the pandemic for posterity. “With the rise of camera phones, people don’t pay as much attention to traditional photography but actually going out of your way means you get some great photos,” he said. “People will forget, in a year or two, all the stuff they went through at the time and having photos helps.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Adhering to social distancing, they have been going door-to-door to capture portraits of families going about their daily lives under the extraordinary circumstances. Trevor Benson, who has been taking photographs of residents in Castledawson, said the reaction to the project has been very positive. He said: “People have been contacting asking ‘what time are you going to be up round this way ’ or ‘are you going to do our area ’ so it’s been good. “They have been sitting waiting, some at the windows or on the doorstep. I think it’s just giving them something to look back on. googletag.cmd.push “Some have said they’ll save it on Facebook and they’ll get a memory every year about it.” Much like the pandemic that inspired it, the project has taken on a worldwide appeal, with Kilrea photographer Carol McLaughlin first seeing it mentioned in America. “A girl from America, I think, started the idea of the doorstep project,” she said. “I’m in a group on Facebook called ‘Women in Photography’ and people said they were doing it in their areas, so I thought it would be really nice to do in our town. “I put a message up on my personal page because more people in the town would be on it, and got a really good response, so we went for it.” googletag.cmd.push As well as providing a record for future generations of what le was like during the  pandemic, the project has helped people to feel connected at a time when distance is in vogue. Photographing in Magherafelt, Joseph Cullen said the idea of connecting people really appealed to him. “A lady contacted me saying she was in England and she hasn’t seen her parents in Magherafelt since January and she was heartbroken about that. “They’re not very good at technology, so I went to their estate and took a nice photograph of them and recorded a video message from her parents to her in England. “It gave them a real sense of things going back to normal and being able to see them again. To be able to do that for people is brilliant.” Re-creating that feeling of connection for older people without access to social media led to John O’Neill going a step further. The Ballinderry photographer reached out specically to the village’s elderly population, with the help of some comprehensive local knowledge. “The third photograph in was Charlie Collins, who had a list made out of  people in the parish who were over , so it went on a bit from there,” he said. “I would say I was calling in an area on a certain day and people would get in contact. I arranged rough times that I would call so they were watching or a family member was keeping an eye out. “They were contacting me looking photos done. Because it was creating a buzz, I was getting phone calls from people not on social media. “A lady beside me said her phone lit up the next day and she was entertained all day by people phoning, saying they had seen her photograph on Facebook, so that was lovely. “They are sitting in the house on their own and a bit of a conversation on the phone was keeping the boredom at bay.” In keeping with the Loughshore parish’s unique character, local residents made sure to put their own spin on their portraits. “The black and white seemed to work well for the older generation. Some of them were putting their stamp on it,they were known for something or were a bit of a character,” said John. “I did Patrick McGuckin’s on Saturday evening and I jokingly said to one boy’ ‘I’ve to go up here and get Patrick and the we’s photo’ and he said, ‘I hope he’s on the sit-on lawnmower’. “Patrick cuts the football field, and sure as could be, Patrick was on the sit-on lawnmower whenever I went up! “There was the odd one needed a wee warning to get spruced up and that’s why I put the call out. They don’t want to be caught short – especially with no hairdressers at the minute!” With reasons to get dressed up currently at a premium, residents of all four areas took the opportunity to don the glad rags, with some going to extreme s. “In one family, the dad came out with make-up on and he was dressed up as a princess – clearly that’s what he’s been doing with his daughter in isolation!” said Carol McLaughlin. “There were a few that threw on a bit of tan and got dolled up. I had said to come whatever way they wanted, so they could get dolled up or come out in their jammies – whatever way they normally spend their days.” Joseph Cullen, who is a member of Mid Ulster Photography Club along with Trevor Benson, said the residents of Magherafelt were also keen to impress. “Sometimes, everyone is dolled up to the nines, has their hair done and are in their best Sunday outfits,” he said. “We’ve had kids getting dressed up in superhero outfits and that kind of stuff. One family all wore matching outfits and some have got their pets involved.” With Covid- affecting work for photographers everywhere, all four that we spoke to were delighted to get out and about and taking pictures again. “My daughter came out with me and we went round the town for three days,” said Carol McLaughlin. “It actually worked out really well, and we got good weather, which helped. It was so nice getting back out with the camera again. “It was a nice, community thing to do. Everybody got involved and it was lovely to see it all at the end – everyone’s pictures of their time in isolation. “What made me want to do it was that it was a moment in history. It will always bring people back to that crazy time when we were all stuck indoors.” In the nostalgia-fuelled reminiscence of le under lockdown, Joseph Cullen feels traditional photography can play a role in preserving memories of the pandemic for posterity. “With the rise of camera phones, people don’t pay as much attention to traditional photography but actually going out of your way means you get some great photos,” he said. “People will forget, in a year or two, all the stuff they went through at the time and having photos helps.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It signalled the start of the countys , but on a national level they were nowhere close to toppling Kerry. This week, Michael McMullan trawls back through the record books. The  All-Ireland was the model title. An underage production line, with  clubs represented on Chris Browns starting team brought Tom Markham back north. It was a performance that warmed the cockles of the Derry fans. Expressive football, mixed with Michael McGoldrick, Gerard OKane and Joe Keenan leading a defence that broke the hearts of forward lines across the land. googletag.cmd.push The following year, with six of the team underage, the Oakleafers were tipped for glory again until Damian Daisy McDermotts goal grabbed victory for Tyrone in the first round. It began a tale of woe for Derrys minor grade, which petered off after Magheras  Hogan Cup win and MacLarnon Cup win  months earlier for St Columbs Derry. Like decades before it, school and county minor success drip-fed into the overall pick for senior managers, an addition to the clubs pathway. The county U team didnt push on like it needed to either. The All-Ireland minor final of  was a rare highlight in a -year drought. Aside from that run, the county registered only three other first round wins –  ,  and until Damian McErlains side sparked the current resurgence. googletag.cmd.push At school level, there was also a blip. St Pius Magherafelt and St Pauls Kilrea both won All-Irelands in , but that was the end of the line until Maghera rose from the ashes again. Derry won back to back Buncrana Cups at U level, but were shocked by Fermanagh at minor level in  when it was their minor time, as the rut continued. In the senior ranks, the county were in a strong position. A NFL title came to Derry in , with a run to the final the following year – both against Kerry. There was a run to the Ulster U final. Ballinderry, Greenlough and Lissan all reaching Ulster club finals at their respective grades, with Shamrocks minors picking up a fourth minor title at St Pauls. Not pushing on from here, as a county, was a missed opportunity. Things began to fall away. Three years in Division  followed, before a rise back to the top level and another league final and a hammering by the all-conquering Dubs. Then came a free-fall from the top. Score dference saved Damian Barton from a drop to Division  in  but this was followed by back to back relegations before Damian McErlain steered them back from the basement. Macker has since stepped down, to be replaced by Rory Gallagher, but before Covid- brought sport to a standstill, Derrys chances of ato Division  were unlikely at best. Looking back at Derrys comparison with Kerry, the Kingdom have won two All-Ireland U U titles since Derrys  triumph. Former Kerry senior boss Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice was on the winning team in  and and lack of silverware at that grade worries him. Fitzmaurice handed  senior debutsto players from the minor teams of  to . Peter Keane, a minor selector under Mickey Ned O Sullivan in  and  before succeeding Jack OConnor as manager for the remainder of the five-in-a-row, took the number to  when appointed as senior boss. Fourteen have played in the championship. In the same time window, playing two and three tiers below Kerry,  Derry players have made it through to senior level. Paul McNeill, Peter Hagan and Danny Tallon played under Richard Ferris in , the rest were part of Damian McErlains minor tenure, with  in all graduating to championship level. The staggering statistic is the contrast with Kerry, in scoring power, from players who have came through. Derrys  minor team was a well-organised unit. Shane McGuigan was the reason they won the Ulster title and he still remains the best forward in the county by some margin. He has scored - in  senior games. With - in  outings, Danny Tallon is a long way back in second place. Paudie McGrogan , Conor Dohertyand Alex Doherty, with -, are next. Compare that to Kerry. Seaacuten OSheas  games brought him a tally of -, David Clfordhas scored -. Killian Spillane, with three of his Templenoe club-mates, bridged the gap from minor to the senior  by playing in the Kerry junior team. Last year, in his debut senior season, Peter Keane handed him a fth championship start in an All-Ireland final and he bagged -. Dara Moynihan, Miceaacutel Burns and defender Tom OSullivan have all contributed to the scoreline. Stats are indicators and dont always tell the full story. Style of play is an influence. Rory Gallagher was slated before a ball was kicked with Derry about his defensive brand of football. From watching games this year and under previous Derry managers, Rory is no dferent. Two men and sometimes one stay up front. There is a link player and everyone  appears briefed with flooding the middle and keeping possession. From watching the teams Derry come up against, what  are you supposed to do. Louth and Tipperary came to the muck and clabber of Celtic Park and parked the bus. Maybe even two or three. Damian McErlain found the same. And every manager before him, struggling to play against the blanket. Remember the  Division  league final  Derry went through a spell of giving the ball away cheaply. Against a Kerry or a Dublin they wouldve got hammered. From talking to Kerrys Eye Sports Editor, Sylvester Hennessy, an analyst under Peter Keane, who is now helping with Limerick. He points out the dference is night and day, once you go down the isions. You still need killer forwards to play attacking football at senior level. Much is talked about youth football, but the Derry club scene isnt coming down with enough candidates. I am thinking of Derrys trip to Paacuteirc Esler. They were squeaky clean in possession. In fact, their setup was spot on. With another steady head and an eye for a score, theyd have beaten both Down and Leitrim. Thats the reality. Organisation and brawn will only take you so far. Finishers win prizes. Even Donegal, who were so negative in the McKenna Cup clash with Derry, are expressive when they head out of Ulster. Hennessy, like Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice, speaks of the attacking brand of football in Kerry. Fitzmaurice stresses how kids want to be the next Gooch, Clford or Mickey Sheehy. He mentions the way football is played allows forwards to develop their craft. Both men mention the  U Paul McGirr final, a thriller won by Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne after extra-time. Fitzmaurice remembers and asks about the blondie fellaup front for Maghera. Hennessy was covering the game and also enquired of Dohertys progress. Eacuteamonn refers to Magheras impressive Hogan Cup final performance in  and Danny Tallons name comes up in the conversation. Conor Converys nine points in the  semi-final win was enough for Fitzmaurice to have his prize defender Brian Oacute Beaglaoich keep tabs on him in the final. “I would have often have seen a lot of similarities between the Derry style of play and the Kerry style of play,” offers Fitzmaurice of his playing days. “That is dferent over the past couple of years for sure, I wouldve thought in the past that the forward culture wouldnt have been that dferent between the two counties.” Going forward, it has been encouraging to see Paul Cassidy and Matthew Downey at club level in the past year. Cassidys performance to save Derry Us from defeat against Armagh was tantalising. Shane McGuigan is crying out for help. As a trio, it could be a decent foundation. Behind this, schools, club and county coaches must produce more of the same from the wheelie bin type coaching of lockdown. With it, needs to come a pressure to change the outlook. Defensive football is perfect for stabilising a team. Derry and Kerry minors were the perfect example. Niall Keenan marked their  dangerman Conor Geaney out of the game, but up popped the unknown quality of Michael Foley to sink Derry. As for the Kingdoms  and  model, they would just give you nightmares. The elephant in the room, one that cant be ignored is the colossal turnover of players. From the start of Damian Bartons tenure, in , Derry have used  playersin league and championship, with  featuring in the latter. To give the numbers some context, Donegal reached three Ulster finals, winning two, during this same spell, using  players in league and championship. Monaghan have used  players. This is something that Derry are going to have to nail,the current underage development is going to bear any fruit. Between players leaving , managers having dferent opinions and the lure of the US in the summer - its impossible for anything to blossom. There is a culture of expectation to be a starter and when players are not making the cut, pressure comes from club managers about wasting their time with the county. Granted, it is easier for a  player to hang around many of the top counties with the chance of winning silverware and the carrot of maybe a team holiday at the end of the season for getting to a final. Another huge issue is a lack of midfielders. When Down pushed up on Derry in Newry, there was nobody to pluck a ball from the skies. A qualier a few years ago against Laois was the same. There is not much you can do without the leather. Hand in hand with this, comes the debate about AFL. Conor Glass, Callum Brown and Anton Tohill were not the finished article. There is Kealan Friel coming through, a late bolter, as termed by U boss Mickey Donnelly, having not progressed through the county minors. The days of the short kick-out are fading. It does have its place, but without any size at midfield there can be no plan B. Like the lack of scoring forwards, ato producing midfielders needs to figure high up any coaching plan for the future. One that must start now. Unless club, school and county are united, and properly, then little change can be expected. And Gerard OKanes team of  and Derrys  senior team will be as far away as ever.

It signalled the start of the countys , but on a national level they were nowhere close to toppling Kerry. This week, Michael McMullan trawls back through the record books. The  All-Ireland was the model title. An underage production line, with  clubs represented on Chris Browns starting team brought Tom Markham back north. It was a performance that warmed the cockles of the Derry fans. Expressive football, mixed with Michael McGoldrick, Gerard OKane and Joe Keenan leading a defence that broke the hearts of forward lines across the land. googletag.cmd.push The following year, with six of the team underage, the Oakleafers were tipped for glory again until Damian Daisy McDermotts goal grabbed victory for Tyrone in the first round. It began a tale of woe for Derrys minor grade, which petered off after Magheras  Hogan Cup win and MacLarnon Cup win  months earlier for St Columbs Derry. Like decades before it, school and county minor success drip-fed into the overall pick for senior managers, an addition to the clubs pathway. The county U team didnt push on like it needed to either. The All-Ireland minor final of  was a rare highlight in a -year drought. Aside from that run, the county registered only three other first round wins –  ,  and until Damian McErlains side sparked the current resurgence. googletag.cmd.push At school level, there was also a blip. St Pius Magherafelt and St Pauls Kilrea both won All-Irelands in , but that was the end of the line until Maghera rose from the ashes again. Derry won back to back Buncrana Cups at U level, but were shocked by Fermanagh at minor level in  when it was their minor time, as the rut continued. In the senior ranks, the county were in a strong position. A NFL title came to Derry in , with a run to the final the following year – both against Kerry. There was a run to the Ulster U final. Ballinderry, Greenlough and Lissan all reaching Ulster club finals at their respective grades, with Shamrocks minors picking up a fourth minor title at St Pauls. Not pushing on from here, as a county, was a missed opportunity. Things began to fall away. Three years in Division  followed, before a rise back to the top level and another league final and a hammering by the all-conquering Dubs. Then came a free-fall from the top. Score dference saved Damian Barton from a drop to Division  in  but this was followed by back to back relegations before Damian McErlain steered them back from the basement. Macker has since stepped down, to be replaced by Rory Gallagher, but before Covid- brought sport to a standstill, Derrys chances of ato Division  were unlikely at best. Looking back at Derrys comparison with Kerry, the Kingdom have won two All-Ireland U U titles since Derrys  triumph. Former Kerry senior boss Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice was on the winning team in  and and lack of silverware at that grade worries him. Fitzmaurice handed  senior debutsto players from the minor teams of  to . Peter Keane, a minor selector under Mickey Ned O Sullivan in  and  before succeeding Jack OConnor as manager for the remainder of the five-in-a-row, took the number to  when appointed as senior boss. Fourteen have played in the championship. In the same time window, playing two and three tiers below Kerry,  Derry players have made it through to senior level. Paul McNeill, Peter Hagan and Danny Tallon played under Richard Ferris in , the rest were part of Damian McErlains minor tenure, with  in all graduating to championship level. The staggering statistic is the contrast with Kerry, in scoring power, from players who have came through. Derrys  minor team was a well-organised unit. Shane McGuigan was the reason they won the Ulster title and he still remains the best forward in the county by some margin. He has scored - in  senior games. With - in  outings, Danny Tallon is a long way back in second place. Paudie McGrogan , Conor Dohertyand Alex Doherty, with -, are next. Compare that to Kerry. Seaacuten OSheas  games brought him a tally of -, David Clfordhas scored -. Killian Spillane, with three of his Templenoe club-mates, bridged the gap from minor to the senior  by playing in the Kerry junior team. Last year, in his debut senior season, Peter Keane handed him a fth championship start in an All-Ireland final and he bagged -. Dara Moynihan, Miceaacutel Burns and defender Tom OSullivan have all contributed to the scoreline. Stats are indicators and dont always tell the full story. Style of play is an influence. Rory Gallagher was slated before a ball was kicked with Derry about his defensive brand of football. From watching games this year and under previous Derry managers, Rory is no dferent. Two men and sometimes one stay up front. There is a link player and everyone  appears briefed with flooding the middle and keeping possession. From watching the teams Derry come up against, what  are you supposed to do. Louth and Tipperary came to the muck and clabber of Celtic Park and parked the bus. Maybe even two or three. Damian McErlain found the same. And every manager before him, struggling to play against the blanket. Remember the  Division  league final  Derry went through a spell of giving the ball away cheaply. Against a Kerry or a Dublin they wouldve got hammered. From talking to Kerrys Eye Sports Editor, Sylvester Hennessy, an analyst under Peter Keane, who is now helping with Limerick. He points out the dference is night and day, once you go down the isions. You still need killer forwards to play attacking football at senior level. Much is talked about youth football, but the Derry club scene isnt coming down with enough candidates. I am thinking of Derrys trip to Paacuteirc Esler. They were squeaky clean in possession. In fact, their setup was spot on. With another steady head and an eye for a score, theyd have beaten both Down and Leitrim. Thats the reality. Organisation and brawn will only take you so far. Finishers win prizes. Even Donegal, who were so negative in the McKenna Cup clash with Derry, are expressive when they head out of Ulster. Hennessy, like Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice, speaks of the attacking brand of football in Kerry. Fitzmaurice stresses how kids want to be the next Gooch, Clford or Mickey Sheehy. He mentions the way football is played allows forwards to develop their craft. Both men mention the  U Paul McGirr final, a thriller won by Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne after extra-time. Fitzmaurice remembers and asks about the blondie fellaup front for Maghera. Hennessy was covering the game and also enquired of Dohertys progress. Eacuteamonn refers to Magheras impressive Hogan Cup final performance in  and Danny Tallons name comes up in the conversation. Conor Converys nine points in the  semi-final win was enough for Fitzmaurice to have his prize defender Brian Oacute Beaglaoich keep tabs on him in the final. “I would have often have seen a lot of similarities between the Derry style of play and the Kerry style of play,” offers Fitzmaurice of his playing days. “That is dferent over the past couple of years for sure, I wouldve thought in the past that the forward culture wouldnt have been that dferent between the two counties.” Going forward, it has been encouraging to see Paul Cassidy and Matthew Downey at club level in the past year. Cassidys performance to save Derry Us from defeat against Armagh was tantalising. Shane McGuigan is crying out for help. As a trio, it could be a decent foundation. Behind this, schools, club and county coaches must produce more of the same from the wheelie bin type coaching of lockdown. With it, needs to come a pressure to change the outlook. Defensive football is perfect for stabilising a team. Derry and Kerry minors were the perfect example. Niall Keenan marked their  dangerman Conor Geaney out of the game, but up popped the unknown quality of Michael Foley to sink Derry. As for the Kingdoms  and  model, they would just give you nightmares. The elephant in the room, one that cant be ignored is the colossal turnover of players. From the start of Damian Bartons tenure, in , Derry have used  playersin league and championship, with  featuring in the latter. To give the numbers some context, Donegal reached three Ulster finals, winning two, during this same spell, using  players in league and championship. Monaghan have used  players. This is something that Derry are going to have to nail,the current underage development is going to bear any fruit. Between players leaving , managers having dferent opinions and the lure of the US in the summer - its impossible for anything to blossom. There is a culture of expectation to be a starter and when players are not making the cut, pressure comes from club managers about wasting their time with the county. Granted, it is easier for a  player to hang around many of the top counties with the chance of winning silverware and the carrot of maybe a team holiday at the end of the season for getting to a final. Another huge issue is a lack of midfielders. When Down pushed up on Derry in Newry, there was nobody to pluck a ball from the skies. A qualier a few years ago against Laois was the same. There is not much you can do without the leather. Hand in hand with this, comes the debate about AFL. Conor Glass, Callum Brown and Anton Tohill were not the finished article. There is Kealan Friel coming through, a late bolter, as termed by U boss Mickey Donnelly, having not progressed through the county minors. The days of the short kick-out are fading. It does have its place, but without any size at midfield there can be no plan B. Like the lack of scoring forwards, ato producing midfielders needs to figure high up any coaching plan for the future. One that must start now. Unless club, school and county are united, and properly, then little change can be expected. And Gerard OKanes team of  and Derrys  senior team will be as far away as ever.

He is now in his second year as Principal of Dingles Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne, who he managed to successive Hogan Cups. He handed senior debuts to  players who played minor against Derry. He spoke to Michael McMullan... *** A  minute phone-call to Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice is time well-spent. The former Kerry boss is as interested as he is interesting. Calm. Concise. A listener and a talker in equal measure. “No problem,” comes the response earlier in the week, to a request for a Kerry angle on an Ulster minor football feature. A peek into the county who know it better than most. A county where football chat ebbs around every corner and silverware is the only currency. googletag.cmd.push Derry went  years without an Ulster minor title. Gradually the wheels of change are beginning to turn. We start our conversation with Kerrys shortfalls. From  until the golden minor generation, Tom Markham didnt set foot inside Kerry. In the senior ranks, by the time Liam Hassett lted Sam, it was  years since  skipper Tommy Doyle carried it into his native Annascaul. A real famine in these parts. - Opinion: Sideline View measures Derry up against the Kingdom. More... As the noughties began, Sam came to visit more often. “There were senior All-Irelands being won and there were no minors being won, so it wasnt as much of a concern,” Fitzmaurice said of the his playing career at the start of the millennium. googletag.cmd.push One or two players coming off a minor production line added to an already strong senior core. Its above that where his concern rests. At U level, a grade where Fitzmaurice, the player, annexed two All-Ireland U medals and found the net in the  win over Laois. “It is a better yardstick for players in terms of making it to senior afterwards,” he adds, looking through the eyes of an ex-senior manager. A sole title since, in , is a concern for him. The minor success was still great, he continues. Of the  players from the winning teams to have already tasted the senior championship, Fitzmaurice and Peter Keane dished out an equal number of debuts. Another eight have played in the league. “I think it is a case by case basis,” Fitzmaurice replies, when prompted about the decision to bring them in. Tom OSullivan, Barry OSullivan and Brian Oacute Beaglaoich, from his Hogan Cup winning team, were first. It is a delicate balancing act, he concedes. Finding the middle ground between giving players exposure and risking long-term prospects. “You have David Clford and the Seaacutenie OShea, they are the exception rather than the norm, who can come through and make an impact straight away,” he points out. Diarmuid OConnor played in the league once he stepped out of minor, just one game. Clford is the only one from the five minor teams to become a fully-fledged Kerry senior in his first year out of underage. “What you find with a lot of the other players, it does take a couple of seasons training with the senior squad,” he added. Five seasons passed before Peter Keane made Shane Ryan the regular senior goalkeeper, reaching an All-Ireland final in . Liam Kearney, minor captain in , wasnt a regular until this season. Another  graduate, Miceaacutel Burns, couldnt nail down a starting berth in the Dr Crokes team that defeated Slaughtneil in , but is now a Kerry regular. Killian Spillane went the scenic route via the All-Ireland junior winning team. “It has probably taken longer than they wouldve anticipated themselves to come through, but it is such a big jump up from minor to senior.” Fitzmaurice chips in with Dublins U success. The politans have won four titles in the last  years and lost last years final. “It takes a couple of seasons to come through and get ready to be at the level where you can really impact...to get used to the level of training, to be physically developed and mentally and emotionally be ready,” he believes. *** Kerrys minor run had to start somewhere. It was a collective, according to Fitzmaurice. Development squads were a big factor, as well as having former Kerry players teaching in the locals schools. The local influence was massive. Jack OConnor is in Colaacuteiste na Sceilge, Liam Hassett is Deputy Principal in St Michaels Listowel. Marc Oacute Seacute is in The Green in Tralee. “They are willing to give time to develop the school teams,” stresses Fitzmaurice, who also has help from an unlikely source in Chorca Dhuibhne. Back in , when Fitzmaurice was Kerry U manager, he knew the season was going to clash with the schools football season. Tommy Grfin runs a pub in Dingle and the hours were never going to clash with school training. Plus, with many of the pupils coming from Tommys native Dingle, the local club would benefit. He gladly agreed. “That was a big factorand other schools have done that, where people were available and were happy to come in to help - it was completely voluntary. It was a coup and a half for us, that someone like that would get involved.” Donal Daly is another link. He played with Fitzmaurice on Kerry teams and operates a hands-off approach in his role as Kerry GAAs Games Manager. He uses his experience from the county scene to oversee and trust people. Allowing them to paddle their own canoe, yet pull the strings together at the same time. “Thats been very effective and has worked well,” Eacuteamonn comments, while also acknowledging the efforts of clubs. “When you put it all together, then a lot of very good players have been developed over the last  or  years and it has certainly worked.” Relationships are important. The school versus county minor loggerheads is a common scenario. But, with Jack OConnor at the helm with the minors in  and , it was the perfect scenario. Fitzmaurice had a good working relationship from playing under Jack with Kerry, and later alongside him as a senior selector. “We had an arrangement that the players spent most of the time with us , played most of the football with us and when the dferent Kerryteams got knocked out along the way, they spent more time with the minors,” Fitzmaurice explains.  Mark OConnor and Brian Oacute Beaglaoich show off the Hogan Cup Four days after the  Hogan Cup final win over Maghera, Kerry played their first minor championship game, a comfortable win over Clare. OSullivan and Oacute Beaglaoich lined out in defence. Current AFL player Mark OConnor and Barry OSullivan were at midfield, Cathal Bambury was in attack, with Tomaacutes Oacute Seacutecoming off the bench. “That was certainly a challenge for the minor management,” he concedes. “They had a bunch of players coming in, who they not seen a huge pile of. “That became the model for other years when Peter Keane became involved , Tommywas a selector with him so there was crossover and co-operation.” St Brendans Killarney followed up with two Hogan Cups. In Fitzmaurices opinion, there was no masterplan, yet it worked. Co-operation, communication and trust, the three words he rolls out. The minor management knew the players would be primed for action. “It has definitely stood usin good stead at colleges and minor level, thankfully it has worked out from our perspective.” *** Trotting down the Cusack Stand corridor, with swapped jerseys slung over their shoulders, the Kerry minors chiselled physique matched their silky skills of the previous hour. When asked about the provision for strength and conditioning, it was done within the school with advice from the minor setup. Given the size of Kerry, pooling for central sessions wasnt feasible. Again, Fitzmaurice drops in the word balance. Between conditioning for the minor season and playing in the schools performance phase and knock-out football. “We got advice on what the minors were doing and what we could do in the school. In the winter time, we did gym work in school and took it into the minor season.” Chorca Dhuibhne could avail of Tomaacutes Oacute Beaglaoich, a teacher in the school. Though not fully qualied , he had knowledge, which he mixed with the advice offered by the county experts and supervised the sessions. “It is an awkward balancing act. We fed into it and tried to do it as best we could. In The Sem , they had Arthur Fitzgerald, who had been involved in the strength and conditioning with Kerry minor and U teams,” Fitzmaurice explains. “I think, across the county, there is joined up thinking from the development squads right up to senior level as to what the best route way is for players and the best way to manage it. “It is a challenge because of all the football players get to play, to balance that with physically developing them. It worked out quite well for us, in that a lot of it was a common-sense approach.” *** One aspect of the school versus county situation across Ulster, was the clash of the MacRory and MacLarnon Cup players and U squads, due to the changing of grades to U and U. It forced players into making choices and balancing spinning plates. Fitzmaurice feels that it is always fair to give new ideas a chance and allow experimentation. Two years down the track, he can now make up his mind. “I think the older age groups , for me, worked better,” he answers, with the experience of the pathway both as a player and manager. “The way it is now, you have a lot of lads doing their leaving cert, they are playing Us and Im not convinced it works. “I think U is a better age-group, by the time they are finished they have a good grounding at the end of the development phase and getting ready to make their mark at senior level.” Comparing the Derry and Kerry minor teams of -, the scoring s and a better balance to Jack OConnor and Peter Keanes teams was the game-changer. “Forwards dont tend to be a huge problem for us, they seem to be part of the identy of Kerry football,” states Fitzmaurice, while feeling the county needs more steeliness in their defence. A couple of hard as nails defenders, he jokes. Does he feel this attacking flair comes from the standard of club football, tradition down through the years or more expression being encouraged  After a brief pause, he feels its a combination of all three. “The standard of coaching and club football is very good here. Every generation growing up, they are looking at Mikey Sheehy, then you are looking at Maurice Fitzgerald, then the Gooch and now Clford. There is always someone to look at and to learn from, so that helps.” The Kerry style of play, he continues, does allow forwards to express themselves more - particularly at younger age groups. All emphasised by the county board coaches around the schools. Fitzmaurice feels the standard of coaching, all over Ireland, is of a high standard, with resources and clinics for coaches to improve. “At the younger age groups there would be a huge emphasis on skill development, getting all the basic skills and going up through the grades, particularly as they get older, the players themselves get more competitive. “It is not enough to have the skills, they need the grounding, the basics and fundamentals at a good level so they can start to aim at winning things. It becomes a bit more serious and tactical, but at the younger age groups there would be a lot of freedom.” The conversation heads to a conclusion, with his impression of Derry. From playing, managing and being at the coalface of underage at school. Alex Dohertys performance in the Paul McGirr final gets a mention. Growing up, do Kerry players have a better chance to flourish  “The way football is played down here , they have a bit more time to develop their craft whereasyou are playing a very defensive-orientated culture it is hard. “Playing against Derry myself, and watching Derry in the recent past they have played a bit more defensive. “There was a time when Derry,you think back  years ago or certainly when I was playing, they were very much a strong physical team and they were a kicking team. They had a great forwards, they had the Bradleysand they were hard to contain. “That is dferent over the past couple of years for sure, I wouldve thought in the past that the forward culture wouldnt have been that dferent between the two counties.” The Kerry man would have often likened the Derry style of play to Kerry. And people down here know their football. The roll of honour reinforces that. RELATED - Fitzmaurice on the lure of Australia More... - Opinion: Sideline View measures Derry up against the Kingdom.

Current AFL player Mark OConnor and Barry OSullivan were at midfield, Cathal Bambury was in attack, with Tomaacutes Oacute Seacutecoming off the bench. “That was certainly a challenge for the minor management,” he concedes. “They had a bunch of players coming in, who they not seen a huge pile of. “That became the model for other years when Peter Keane became involved , Tommywas a selector with him so there was crossover and co-operation.” St Brendans Killarney followed up with two Hogan Cups. In Fitzmaurices opinion, there was no masterplan, yet it worked. Co-operation, communication and trust, the three words he rolls out. The minor management knew the players would be primed for action. “It has definitely stood usin good stead at colleges and minor level, thankfully it has worked out from our perspective.” *** Trotting down the Cusack Stand corridor, with swapped jerseys slung over their shoulders, the Kerry minors chiselled physique matched their silky skills of the previous hour. When asked about the provision for strength and conditioning, it was done within the school with advice from the minor setup. Given the size of Kerry, pooling for central sessions wasnt feasible. Again, Fitzmaurice drops in the word balance. Between conditioning for the minor season and playing in the schools performance phase and knock-out football. “We got advice on what the minors were doing and what we could do in the school. In the winter time, we did gym work in school and took it into the minor season.” Chorca Dhuibhne could avail of Tomaacutes Oacute Beaglaoich, a teacher in the school. Though not fully qualied , he had knowledge, which he mixed with the advice offered by the county experts and supervised the sessions. “It is an awkward balancing act. We fed into it and tried to do it as best we could. In The Sem , they had Arthur Fitzgerald, who had been involved in the strength and conditioning with Kerry minor and U teams,” Fitzmaurice explains. “I think, across the county, there is joined up thinking from the development squads right up to senior level as to what the best route way is for players and the best way to manage it. “It is a challenge because of all the football players get to play, to balance that with physically developing them. It worked out quite well for us, in that a lot of it was a common-sense approach.” *** One aspect of the school versus county situation across Ulster, was the clash of the MacRory and MacLarnon Cup players and U squads, due to the changing of grades to U and U. It forced players into making choices and balancing spinning plates. Fitzmaurice feels that it is always fair to give new ideas a chance and allow experimentation. Two years down the track, he can now make up his mind. “I think the older age groups , for me, worked better,” he answers, with the experience of the pathway both as a player and manager. “The way it is now, you have a lot of lads doing their leaving cert, they are playing Us and Im not convinced it works. “I think U is a better age-group, by the time they are finished they have a good grounding at the end of the development phase and getting ready to make their mark at senior level.” Comparing the Derry and Kerry minor teams of -, the scoring s and a better balance to Jack OConnor and Peter Keanes teams was the game-changer. “Forwards dont tend to be a huge problem for us, they seem to be part of the identy of Kerry football,” states Fitzmaurice, while feeling the county needs more steeliness in their defence. A couple of hard as nails defenders, he jokes. Does he feel this attacking flair comes from the standard of club football, tradition down through the years or more expression being encouraged  After a brief pause, he feels its a combination of all three. “The standard of coaching and club football is very good here. Every generation growing up, they are looking at Mikey Sheehy, then you are looking at Maurice Fitzgerald, then the Gooch and now Clford. There is always someone to look at and to learn from, so that helps.” The Kerry style of play, he continues, does allow forwards to express themselves more - particularly at younger age groups. All emphasised by the county board coaches around the schools. Fitzmaurice feels the standard of coaching, all over Ireland, is of a high standard, with resources and clinics for coaches to improve. “At the younger age groups there would be a huge emphasis on skill development, getting all the basic skills and going up through the grades, particularly as they get older, the players themselves get more competitive. “It is not enough to have the skills, they need the grounding, the basics and fundamentals at a good level so they can start to aim at winning things. It becomes a bit more serious and tactical, but at the younger age groups there would be a lot of freedom.” The conversation heads to a conclusion, with his impression of Derry. From playing, managing and being at the coalface of underage at school. Alex Dohertys performance in the Paul McGirr final gets a mention. Growing up, do Kerry players have a better chance to flourish  “The way football is played down here , they have a bit more time to develop their craft whereasyou are playing a very defensive-orientated culture it is hard. “Playing against Derry myself, and watching Derry in the recent past they have played a bit more defensive. “There was a time when Derry,you think back  years ago or certainly when I was playing, they were very much a strong physical team and they were a kicking team. They had a great forwards, they had the Bradleysand they were hard to contain. “That is dferent over the past couple of years for sure, I wouldve thought in the past that the forward culture wouldnt have been that dferent between the two counties.” The Kerry man would have often likened the Derry style of play to Kerry. And people down here know their football. The roll of honour reinforces that. RELATED - Fitzmaurice on the lure of Australia More... - Opinion: Sideline View measures Derry up against the Kingdom.

The help from the UK’s armed forces during the Coronavirus outbreak has taken a number of dferent forms. The Armed Forces have deployed dozens of military planners across the UK, which has seen them working with Local Resilience Forums and Partnerships, alongside the Emergency Co-ordination Centres in Scotland and Wales supporting public services, local authorities and emergency services. googletag.cmd.push The UK Armed Forces’ efforts have included working with specialists from Boots Pharmacists to train testing personnel, the provision of military testers to regional testing centres and the delivery of vital testing equipment. Military personnel are also currently working to distribute PPE to NHS trusts and organisations across the country. Up to May , Armed Forces personnel had helped to deliver over . billion items of PPE to NHS staff in England. Six military specialists have also been deployed to assist NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde with the fitting of FFP face masks. A new COVID Aviation Task Force has been established. This includes two RAF Puma based in Kinloss Barracks to help the NHS in Scotland and Northern England. Support has included training key workers in ious locations around the Western Hebrides in medical evacuation procedures and supporting NHS staff, plus helping with five medical evacuations in England and Scotland.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has also helped more than , British passengers who were aboard  cruise ships disembark. A package of measures to support British nationals who are still waiting toto the UK has also been put in place. The support package addresses financial issues, healthcare concerns and visa extensions, as well as loans for those who cannot afford flights to the UK where they have exhausted all other options. Working to end extreme poverty across the world The Department for International Developmentleads the UK’s work to end extreme poverty. The UK is an international development superpower, and we are also a scientic and medical world leader. UK-based scientists, such as those at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine are playing key roles in the global response to this deadly new virus. Through the DFID aid budget, the UK is the largest single national contributor to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations international efforts to find a vaccine. Through this fund, we are working to improve our understanding of the virus and to support scientists around the globe – CEPI is already backing nine potential vaccines. Once a vaccine is found, delivering it globally will be the next big challenge. To help that, the Government has invested the equivalent of pound million a year for the next five years in Gavi, the global vaccine alliance that delivers vaccines in  of the poorest countries around the world. _CoronavirusPHutm_mediumdisplayutm_sourceMediaForceutm_contentxframingdclidCMvRxrHcOkCFXNoFQgdwFYCw\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noopener\"If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Terence McDowell, principal of St Eithnes Primary School, has also supported calls from church leaders for the  plus transfer test to be scrapped this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Education Minister last week said it was his aim to see a phased reopening of schools across the North, starting with limited provisionfor GCSE, A-Level and P pupils this summer. Mr McDowell said he first learnt of the Education Ministersplans from the news and had not been consulted about them. googletag.cmd.push It was the first we heard of it and a lot of questions would need to be answered first, said Mr McDowell. The Minister wasnt very definite about the plans. Mr McDowell said he feels very sorry for his P pupils who face the possible prospect of moving on to post-primary school without the chance to say goodbye. My heart goes out to them, said Mr McDowell.For the other primaries we will eventually get them back and we can make up for the missed time, but for the Ps you can never replace that time. There are so many rites of passage like their school trip that they will never get to do and they will go into post primary without preparation that we would normally give them for what is a such a big change. googletag.cmd.push If the plans go ahead, it will give us some formof contact and offer some closure to both pupils and staff. The P teachers were told they might not see these pupils again with just two days notice. Staff at St Eithnes PS had already created a DVD for P pupils and a certicate to mark the end of their time at the school. Its always sad to see pupils go, but it will beall themore poignant this year, said Mr McDowell. Under Minister Weirs plans, primary schools and post primary schools would reopen with limited provision for key cohort years in August, followed by a phased provision for all pupils at the beginning of September. However, teachers would traditionally be on annual leave during the school summer break in July and August. Teachers have been working really hard preparing online resources and work packs to keep pupils going, said Mr McDowell. We dontknow what the requirementswill be, but I believeit will be  pupils to a classroom. We have almost  in our two P classes so they will need to be split into two rooms and that will require more staff. The physical layout of desks and chairs will need to be considered and the resources they are using. We have already discussed requisitioning inidual resource packs for each child but that will come at an extra expense to the school and Im sure we wontget any extra resources. Mr McDowell said the movement of pupils outside the classrooms would also be a concern. We need to consider how the children will move around the school as the corridors arent very wide. We also need to think about meal times in the canteen, where normally we would have one or two slots to feed the whole school. Toilet breaks will need to be consideredtoo and time given for children to properly wash their hands. This will all be time taken out of teaching time. Keeping the childrentwo metres apart staff and each other would be particularlydficult for younger pupils. Children in P naturally gravitate towards one another, said Mr McDowell. You cant police that, it is going to be impossible. Things happen at school where children fall and hurt themselves and they will need comforted. Do we have to tell a child with a bleeding to chin to wait while we ring their parents  Some children will find the transition to primary school dficult and they might be crying or upset. To not be able to comfort that child goes against the grain of the very reasons that teachers came into this profession. Last week,Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown sent a letter to Catholic post-primary schools asking for the transfer test to be scrapped this year, a call echoed by Mr McDowell. The transfer test causes much anxiety anyway and our teachers have been unable to prepare children in the normal way this year and working from home just doesnt compare. It is causing much anxiety and we need to consider something to stop that. There isnt a levelplaying field in what parents can provide. They might be working from home, they might have multiple children, they might be looking after an elderly relative. Every household is unique. I am very mindful that parents have been thrust into the role of teachers, they are not professional teachers. Parents shouldnt compare themselves to others. We always tell the children just do your best and thats the same message I would have for parents. They are doing the best they can. Meanwhile, Derry Sinn Fein MLA Karen Mullan, has called for an`education forum comprising of teachers, school leaders, parents, trade unions and public health experts to be convened before schools are allowed to . The deputy chair of the assembly education committee, said the forum, would address huge concern and anxiety at the prospect of an eventualto school. Its my view that anyto school must be done in complete partnership and in conversation with all those involved in education when the time comes, said Ms Mullan. Parents, young people and our teaching staff must have confidence that health and safety is paramount in anyto school. There will be no one size fits all approach for schools in preparing to re-open. There should be an intense period of discussion that will be crucial to understand the flexibilities and the bespoke needs that dferent schools and dferent settings will require.

Emma McClughan hopes to raise over pound, from selling prints of her painting, which has captured the imagination of her friends and colleagues. Her image captures the worry felt by the crews in the ambulance and on the Air Ambulance in the form of aangel and hope is represented in the form of a rainbow. The Magherafelt woman initially posted her painting on social media and was overwhelmed by the response and positivity of the comments, with people offering to buy the painting outright. googletag.cmd.push Having worked closely with the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service , Emma decided to donate any money raised from the sale of the prints to Air Ambulance NI. Breige Mulholland of AANI welcomed the donation and reiterated the importance of fundraising activities for the charity. “We are so touched that Emma has used her talents in such a heartfelt and positive way in recognition of all that NIAS and AANI do  days of the year,” she said. “As a charity, we need to raise poundm a year to keep the HEMS operational. Due to the virus all fundraising events in aid of AANI have been axed and our community are no longer able to support in the usual ways. googletag.cmd.push “Yet trauma incidents continue to occur, and public support is crucial. We thank Emma for her creativity and generosity.” NIAS Chief Executive, Michael Bloomfield, also praised Emma’s generosity. He said: “The fact that Emma’s first thoughts were that this should be sold to raise money for the Charity Air Ambulance speaks to her as a person. “It reflects a generosity of spirit which is so common among our young people and which is getting a chance to shine, like a rainbow, in these dark days. “I am constantly in awe of NIAS staff. Every day they give their all for patients and many go over and above what is expected of them. “They are all being asked to give more at this time and I am so proud of the manner in which they have risen to the challenge. But over the past couple of months, we have all been lucky to have been given an insight into some of their other talents – musical, dancing, poetry and now artistry. “This image is one that has touched the hearts of many in the way in which it shows that we are all in this together and that there will be brighter days for us all to enjoy again.” Prints of Emma’s painting can be purchased from the Air Ambulance website – www.airambulanceni.org.

St Mary’s have been involved with Ronan McLaughlin of Sustrans NI this year and it has continued during lockdown. His challenges incorporated into their weekly timetables for online learning.

In no time, French blogger Justin Velo brought the design to le, prompting an increase in demand for the jersey to be made. Interest flooded in from all over the world.

Their clothing is worn by professional athletes, national champions and Olympians. Principal Corinne Coyle assures us, they are in good company with our Conan! “I was so excited when my jersey was being retweeted by so many people,” Conan told the County Derry Post “When I was designing the top, I thought the Covid- message, Keep your distance would be equally good for cyclists, as I know they often worry about how close motorists get to them when they are out on the roads. “So, as well as saving lives against the virus, the message could also save lives on our roads. My sister Cadhla is looking for some credit, as I used her markers to colour the jersey!” Pactimo have agreed to initially make two copies of the original design, one for Conan and one for the school. Exciting discussions are currently underway with Pactimo to decide how this brilliant design can best reach a wider audience and benefit others in the process. As this project continues to unfold, excitement is at an all-time high at St Mary’s PS Draperstowns Learning Hub.

DUP Alderman Graham Warke said many people from the local area travelled  miles to Lisburn to visit the Lagan Valley Leisureplex which has a number of swimming pools and state-of-the-art facilities. He said Derry City and Strabane District Council should be looking to create a similar facility. Alderman Warke was speaking today at the councils monthly meeting during a discussion on the future of local leisure facilities. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon brought a motion before the meeting asking the council to note the public disappointment at the lack of progress to date to advance the construction and re-development of Templemore Sports Complex in Derry and Riversdale Leisure Centre in Strabane. googletag.cmd.push The motions stated: “This motion calls on Council to prioritise the development of those long outstanding projects by bringing forward a report to the Council meeting in September to include the identication of all funding options available and a timetable towards completion so that the Council can consider its options.” Alderman Warke told the meeting his party would support the motion but added that he believed the council should use the opportunity to look at ways of improving its leisure facilities even further. He said he had travelled with his family to the Lagan Valley Leisureplex because of the facilities. He said he knew other local families who had done the same. googletag.cmd.push Alderman Warke said the council now had an opportunity to look at creating a similar leisure facility which could attract thousands of people. He added that the council should aim big. In relation to Cllr Mellons motion, SDLP councillor John Boyle proposed an amendment which would replace the word prioritise with the word accelerate. Cllr Boyles amendment proposal was supported by  councillors and opposed by ten. The reworded motion was then passed unanimously at the meeting.

They are open from pm to pm, Monday to Friday.ldquoWhile we are open again we are operating under strict guidelines with one-ways systems in place, designated seating areas and a maximum of eight people in the church at any one time, he said.ldquoI had hoped to reintroduce a limited number of sacramentals such as confession and benediction in Kilcoo, as this parish have had very little in the way of services over the last few years due to a shortage of priests. However, diocesan officials have cautioned against it, just now.Fr McKinley, who has been parish priest at Kilmegan for ten years, continued: ldquoThe virus came upon us out to the blue. It was a whopping surprise to all of us. Thirty years of the Troubles didnrsquot close us down but I suppose we all just have to put up with it as these are unprecedented times.Despite the first steps being taken to open churches Fr McKinley cautioned it could be quite some time before the parishes could resume their normal schedule.ldquoSt Malachyrsquos in Castlewellan holds over  people. I foresee it wonrsquot be any time soon before we are able to facilitate anything like that number, said Fr McKinley has had to reschedule  weddings and postpone First Communions and confirmations until later in the year.He added: ldquoIt is an eerie and uncomfortable feeling to celebrate Mass in an empty church and I long for the day we will see our churches full to capacity once more.ldquoHowever, while the obligation to attend Sunday Mass has been temporarily lted Masses are still available on the parish webcam for everyone to view.Magheradroll Church of Ireland Church in Ballynahinch will be open for one hour each Thursday, starting next week.Canon Warren Russell, rector, said: ldquoI welcome the reopening of the church in line with the recommendations made by the Northern Ireland Assembly.ldquoWe will open from am to noon on a Thursday which coincides with market day in the town.ldquoWe want to reassure people that all possible safety measures will be in place to facilitate the opening and provide a quiet space for prayer and reflection once again.ldquoThere will be masks, disposable gloves and hand sanitiser available at the back of the church for people to use.Canon Russell, who has been rector for the past  years, added: ldquoWe will measure the response and review it again in a few weeks.

But with the COVID- restrictions Irsquove decided to take the challenge on Zwt to avoid any risk of burdening the health service.Proceeds from the challenge will go to the mental health charities Aware and Ballynahinch Counselling Services, also known as The Hub.ldquoOur lives have been turned upside down with the COVID- pandemic and many people are finding it dficult to cope with the changes, health concerns and isolation of it all, Alan continued.ldquoMental health issues can affect anyone and looking after our mental health is key to our overall emotional and physical wellbeing.ldquoSo far Irsquove raised almost pound and would really like to get to pound.

He then raised the alarm with their parents, Valerie and Declan senior, who rushed to be with their son.Paramedics were quickly on to the scene, but on the way to Belfastrsquos Royal Victoria Hospital , the teenager needed a le-saving blood transfusion due to his major internal injuries.The ambulance was met in Greyabbey by a doctor and the emergency helicopter team where the procedure was carried out before Declan continued on to hospital by air.The Year  student from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, later underwent eight hours of surgery to save him.Two and a half weeks later, Declan was back at home recovering with his family and vowing to get back on to a tractor as soon as he is fit and able.Eoin, who also attends St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick, wants to give another person a chance of survival.He has started a Just Giving appeal to fund the provincersquos helicopter emergency medical serviceand raise at least the pound, it costs to run it per day. The family has now raised nearly pound,, including gt aid for the service as their thanks for saving Declan.Mrs Keating says her son has a ldquolong road to recovery with rehabilitation and further surgery down the line but they are ldquoforever indebted to the air ambulance and the entire hospital team who cared for Declan. She said surgeons told her that he was ldquoextremely lucky as the accident could have had fatal consequences.Reliving the morning of the accident when Declan mdash whose nickname is lsquoThe Milkmanrsquo mdash and Eoin had just left home to go their unclersquos farm for the milking at am, is still traumatic for Mrs Keating.She said: ldquoI donrsquot like to think about what happened to Declan. For what happened and how it happened, itrsquos nothing short of a miracle for him to be here. We were told thathis injuries had been one centimetre one way or the other, it could have been a lot worst. There were terrible injuries but at least there was no injury to his head or spine head.ldquoIt was just a freak accident and hopefully nothing like this will ever happen again. However, Declan has told me that he will be back in the tractor as soon as he can walk.Mrs Keating said Declan had passed his tractor driving test late last year and was used to driving their tractor to her brotherrsquos nearby dairy farm.ldquoThe boys had set off from home and were literally just yards down the road when the accident happened,ldquo she continued. ldquoWe are not sure how but Declan said that one minute he was driving and the next he was flung out the side door onto the road and the tractor ran over him.ldquoThe tractor continued moving and Eoin managed to get it stopped and immediately checked on Declan and called his daddy.ldquoDeclan was fully conscious and realised he was badly injured. He checkedhis legs and arms worked. He thought that his pelvis was broken and wanted to seehe was paralysed and somehow managed to get himself up and walk over to the other verge before his legs gave way. He was sitting up when me and his father arrived at the scene.Mrs Keating said that while both Declan and Eoin were naturally shocked by what had happened, she was proud of both her sonsrsquo presence of mind during the horric accident.ldquoEoin called us  seconds after the accident and we were there within minutes, she said. ldquoDeclan was alert the whole time when the ambulance and paramedics arrived.Mrs Keating and her husband followed behind the ambulance as Declan was rushed to the RVH. An emergency doctor met the ambulance in Kircubbin before continuing on. However, the parents feared the worst when the ambulance pulled over at the tennis courts in Greyabbey.ldquoThe doctor jumped out of the ambulance and told us not to worry, Declan was OK. He was going to give him a blood transfusion as he was losing blood internally and the air ambulance was on its way. Literally, it seemed the helicopter arrived just seconds later and Declan was transferred by air then to the hospital.Mrs Keating said that the blood transfusion was vital to Declan at that time, adding: ldquoFor remote communities where we live, the air ambulance is an essential service. They only have started carrying blood supplies earlier this year. If he hadnrsquot have gotten the blood, he may not have been here.Declanrsquos injuries were found to be signicant. He sustained a broken pelvis, perforated bladder and bowel, a collapsed lung, three broken ribs, internal bleeding and bruising.Mrs Keating said: ldquoThe accident and emergency doctor said he would have expected anyone  to be in a critical condition with the range of injuries but Declan was in a serious condition which showed us what a fighter he was and he wasnrsquot letting it get the better of him. We took some comfort from this at that time.She said that three teams of specialist surgeons operated on Declan for more than eight hours to deal with his major injuries.ldquoThe surgeons were extremely worried about Declan and I kept askinghe was going to be OK. The surgeon would only say that he was out of immediate danger and that the next - hours would be critical, she said.Declan spent three nights in intensive care before moving into another ward. Mrs Keating said that the care Declan received was ldquofirst-class and spoke of how caring the medics were to their plight.ldquoDeclanrsquos father and I wanted to be with him through the night. At one point the ward sister called us over and offered us the sleep room the surgeons use for rest during their sht. They gave up that room for us for three nights so we could be with Declan and we saw just how busy they all were. We thank them from the bottom of our hearts for their kindness.The family say they were overwhelmed by the support and well wishes they received from their local community and their donations to the appeal.Mrs Keating added: ldquoDeclan will recover and he canrsquot wait to be up again at am every morning to help on the farm as he just loves the farming le. The air ambulance was the legacy of Dr John Hinds [the late emergency medicine specialist] and it would be remiss of me not to remember him and what he did for others during his le and his campaign to get the service. We are forever indebted to him and the air ambulance service for saving Declanrsquos le.ldquoRegarding farm accidents in Northern Ireland, we know we are one of the more fortunate families and we are so thankful. I hope people continue to give money as itrsquos a vital service for the whole of Northern Ireland.To donate go to www.justgiving fundraising eoin-keating..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th May 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C May 27%2C 2000  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH ndash Residents at a Ballynahinch housing estate are due to hold talks with a range of key officials this morning in a bid to raise the profile of the area.People from the Hillcrest Drive area in the town are due to meet with senior officials from the Housing Executive, Down Council and the Department of Environment.The meeting comes in the wake of recent vandalism attacks in the Windmill Street area which damaged a number of cars, homes and business properties.Prior to this morningrsquos meeting, residents met with local councillor Anne McAleenan to discuss their concerns and prepare for the crucial talks with the representatives of the statutory agencies.Last weekend, the local councillor discussed with residents their concerns and advised them to draw up a strategy and work closely with the ious agencies who could provide them with key assistance.One of the main concerns is an area at the top of Hillcrest Drive which residents would like to see the Department of Environment cleaning up to enhance the image of the area.In addition, residents are calling for environmental improvements and also believe sealing off the rear of the estate from the lough area could prevent trouble at weekends.KILLYLEAGH ndash The impact a young Killyleagh footballer is having on the international soccer stage was praised at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Down Council.Killyleagh councillor Sam Osborne highlighted the achievements of  year-old David Healy who marked his Northern Ireland debut with a brace against Luxembourg and another strike against Malta.Mr Osborne said the young Manchester United star was a great ambassador for the area and last week received the international personality of the year award at the annual Northern Ireland soccer writers awards sponsored by Guinness.The local councillor said Healyrsquos success for Manchester United and the Northern Ireland team was a great boost for the area.ARDGLASS ndash An Ardglass couple are waging a war against hostile waters in an attempt to circumnavigate Ireland for charity.Rhonda and Vincent Kearney set sail in their -foot boat, Invinceable, on Saturday to make their way around Ireland in a bid to raise pound, to help buy a new leboat.And while the duo is no stranger to challenge, both sailors admit they face a fearsome feat.Vincent is a former Red Arrow and a stunt motorcyclist, while his we, Rhonda, is the former British clay pigeon shooting champion, but nothing, they say, could prepare them for the journey they are now making.ldquoWe only concocted the plan three months ago and thought we had better act quickly before we have time to think about what we are letting ourselves in for, said Vincent.ldquoI have been sailing on and off for about  years and have owned boats for quite some time, but it will still be extremely dficult, particularly with the dreadful weather forecasts we have been given.

Even so, there is a palpable sense of joy among the golfing fraternity.St Patrickrsquos Golf Club in Downpatrick resumed last Wednesday and the captain, Robert McCausland, said he ldquowas absolutely delighted.ldquoThe club is very pleased to be up and running again, he remarked.ldquoWe are very grateful to our green keepers who continued with their work during the lockdown and have delivered a golf course in magnicent condition for the members to enjoy.Mr McCausland said the club was now open to new members and that there were a ldquonumber of very attractive offers in place for those who may wish to take up the game of golf.He added: ldquoThe time sheets over the last few days are quite full and the car park has been busy with lots of smiling, happy faces about the club.Wednesday also saw the reopening of Ardglass Club and Paul Vaughan, the clubrsquos director of golf, said the course has been full up ever since.ldquoOur members have been playing in three-balls and going off every  minutes. We havenrsquot had a spare space since we re-opened, he said.ldquoEveryone is delighted to be back and itrsquos great to see so many people about. I think our members were glad to get out of the house and back on to the golf course.ldquoWe have a marshal at the front gate and the members are obeying the all the guidelines so that they can play casual golf.Mr Vaughan said the loss of visitors represented the loss of a major source of income for the club, but hoped this would be offset by new members.ldquoWe have had a lot of enquiries about new members, but visitorsrsquo green fees are a huge part of our business, he said.ldquoHopefully, we will be able to salvage something towards the end of the season and things willto something near normal next year.At Spa Golf Club, near Ballynahinch, which re-opened on Friday, the captain, Gordon Martin said everyone was ldquoexcited at the expectation of getting back playing in a sport we love so much.He went on: ldquoI am very aware of the sacrices many people have made in our communities that allows us to get to this point. May I on behalf of Spa Golf Club members and their families thank all the heros in out communities.ldquoSpa recognises the great responsibility golf has in being one of the first sports to re-open after the lockdown and fully intends to adhere to all the protocols agreed by our governing body.He said the club had been fortunate to be able to keep some greens staff working at the club over the lockdown period.ldquoThe driest April on record put extra burdens on green keeping staff in terms of additional watering and essential maintenance. But we are pleased to say the course is looking just magnicent.Mr Martin also said it has been a dficult period from a financial point of view with not many golf clubs being eligible for any signicant assistance under the ious Covid finance packages.Bright Castle Golf Club, which is privately owned by the Ennis family, has also been busy since it re-opened last Thursday.ldquoThe course is looking magnicent and the members are enjoying it, said Linda Ennis.ldquoItrsquos been a tough few months, but wersquove worked hard to keep the course maintained to a high standard and itrsquos really looking the part.ldquoThe members are glad to be out playing and itrsquos great to see so many happy faces.ldquoThe last time the course was closed this long was about six or seven years ago and that was because of heavy show. It was a bit disheartening having the place empty in April and earlier this month when the weather was lovely.She added: We rely on visitors and societies for a good portion of our income, but we have had enquiries about new memberships, which is good news for us.Crossgar Golf Club president Paddy Bell heaped praise on the clubrsquos green keeping staff for having the course in great shape and also revealed there has been a surge in new members.ldquoWe have had a big uptake in new members in the past few weeks, which will help compensate for the lack of green fees, he said.ldquoWe re-opened last Wednesday and itrsquos fantastic to see people playing again. It gives you hope that everything may soonto normality.ldquoThe course is in great condition and thatrsquos due to the green keeping staff who have worked hard during the lockdown. All praise is due them.Temple Golf Club has also been inundated with membership enquiries. Since it re-opened last week it has welcomed  new junior members.Owner Tim Martin said the pandemic lockdown couldnrsquot have come at a worse time with membership subions due on April .ldquoAs like every other club, our income disappeared overnight. We depend heavily on the income from the restaurant and bar and our cash flow dwindled rapidly, Mr Martin said.ldquoWe were only able to continue paying our staff each week because of some of the loyal members who paid their fees on time. To them we are very grateful. This kept us ticking over until the government job retention scheme kicked in.Mr Martin said the members had been very accommodating and were adhering to the guidelines and protocols.ldquoWe look forward to progressing into the next stage, but will have to make sure it will be financially viable to open the restaurant and bar when the time comes, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th May 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Loughinisland man Gerry praises Move More initiative  ","story":"THERE are not many who have been to the top of the majestic Efel Tower in France.But Loughinisland man Gerry Morgan is one of the lucky few who have made it to the summit to snatch a birdrsquos eye view of the stunning Parisian landscape.That was  years ago when he opted for the easy option by popping into the lt and by-passing the , steps.

We also do sit-ups and squats.After the exercise regime it is time for a coffee and a chat, which all the Move More participants thoroughly enjoy.ldquoWe are literally one big family as many of us have been through cancer and fortunately come out the other side. In a way, illness has brought us together, continued Gerry.But everything changed in March when the arrival of the coronavirus forced Newry, Mourne and Down Council to close all its leisure centres and public buildings.To keep everyone involved, Laura mdash one of  Move More coordinators funded by Macmillan in every council area across the province to support those living with cancer mdash created an app to enable people to keep in touch remotely and exercise at home.She also recently unveiled a new initiative encouraging people living with cancer to virtually climb their way around some of the worldrsquos top landmarks to stay active during the coronavirus pandemic, without leaving the comfort of their own homes.Laura said that while Move More members were not able to physically travel the world at the moment, there was no limit to their imagination.Participants were given the choice of a number of buildings to scale, including Londonrsquos imposing Big Ben.Not surprisingly, Gerry opted to head back to the top of the Efel Tower, only this time he didnrsquot have to leave his front door during the virtual challenge. He set off at a leisurely pace and over three days and, with a little je nous said quoi, made it to the top.ldquoI could have completed the climb in two days, but decided to do it over three instead, he joked. ldquoI really enjoyed doing it, but miss being with my Move More friends.Gerry is pleased that while face-to-face classes and appointments are not possible, Laura has been working on positive, fun and interesting ways to keep programme participants motivated and active in the comfort of their own surroundings.He is also looking forward to getting back to the Down Leisure Centre when it is safe to do so and the pandemic is no more.Recalling the first time he went to the centre following his referral, Gerry admits that he was a little apprehensive.ldquoI distinctly remember driving to Downpatrick and was so nervous that I almost turned the car around to go back home, he said. ldquoBut I continued on and am so glad that I did. It has been an overwhelmingly positive experience for me, one that I thoroughly enjoy.ldquoI was a bit down for a few years after losing my lung and the chemotherapy, but getting involved with the Move More programme changed everything.

are recommending that a proposal for a major new housing development comprising  new homes at an  acre site on the outskirts of Ballynahinch should proceed.Their recommendation to approve plans for a mixed development comprising a range of detached, semi detached and townhouses on the Lisburn Road will be discussed at next weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee.This particular committee has not met since March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and to comply with social distancing requirements, the planning meeting will be held at Newry Leisure Centre next Wednesday.In papers submitted ahead of the meeting, the proposed development site mdash which comprises a number of fields mdash is described as ldquoirregular in shape, with the recently constructed Lime Trees, Edengrove and Kinedale developments in close proximity.Planners say that the site earmarked for the new homes is located on the ldquoinner edge of Ballynahinchrsquos development limits, with the area zoned for housing in the Down Area Plan.It is also confirmed in the planning papers that initially, plans were lodged to build  homes, but the figure was subsequently revised after planners expressed concern.The Department for Infrastructure is also content that the proposed housing scheme can be accommodated within the existing roads network.Northern Ireland Water said there is available capacity within the existing sewerage system to cope with the planned new homes, while planning permission has been granted for a new sewage pumping station on adjacent land.The papers indicate that the planning application was submitted in March  and that a number of objections to the proposed development were lodged.Other objections to the proposed housing scheme centre around traffic and access arrangements, claims that the application had not been properly advertised and insufficient neighbourhood notication.Objectors also pointed to the lack of a so-called planting buffer and the ldquolack of effort to integrate an open space area adjacent Ballynahinch River into the proposed development.Another objector highlighted the schemersquos ldquoinappropriate density, arguing that it is greater than other developments closer to the town.The detail of a noise impact assessment submitted to planners has also been questioned, but Newry Mourne and Down Council environmental health officials have expressed satisfaction with the document.The planning papers reveal that an acoustic mound has been incorporated in to the proposed development, with landscaped proposed throughout to mitigate any noise impact on adjacent land uses.In addition, the papers confirm that there is a Tree Preservation Order covering the site and while a number of trees have already been felled, this issue is the subject of an enforcement case.Planners say the proposed development is ldquoappropriate to the character and topography of the site and that ldquoadequate provision is made for public and private open space and landscaped areas as an integral part of the development.They also state that where appropriate, planted areas of discrete groups of trees will be required along site boundaries ldquoin order to soften the visual impact of the development and assist in its integration with the surrounding area, with adequate provision made for parking.Planners say that the development will not have an ldquounacceptable, adverse effect on existing or proposed properties in terms of overlooking, loss of light, overshadowing, noise or other disturbance.Next weekrsquos planning committee meeting takes place two days after the local authorityrsquos annual meeting when it is expected that Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, will be

It will help boost the entire thoroughbred industry.ldquoWe very much understand that racing will be behind closed doors for the foreseeable future and will work diligently to comply with the very strict protocols put in place to ensure the safety of all those attending.The July date was announced by the Board of Horse Racing Ireland, which met recently and agreed a number of fixtures for theof race meetings.The first meeting is at Naas on June , with National Hunt racing resuming at Limerick on June .For the first three weeks, racing will be restricted to nine racecourses which are more centrally located to minimise travel distances and which also have higher stable capacities given the requirement for one stable per horse under the new protocols.All the fixtures will take place under the strict protocols published by Horse Racing Ireland.Brian Kavanagh, chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, said: ldquoWe are grateful to everybody for the patience they have shown during this very dficult time and we will provide every opportunity for essential personnel to fully understand and implement theto racing protocols.ldquoWe expect there to be signicant demand for horses to run once we resume, and we will aim to provide opportunities across the spectrum of age, gender and ability.ldquoWe will have missed  weeksrsquo racing which will take some time to catch up. We intend to do this over the course of the rest of the year rather than immediately.Meanwhile, golf has ed after a two-month lockdown.The Stormont Executive gave clubs the green light to open up last week subject to strict guidelines. Clubhouses remained closed and no visitors are permitted.Tennis clubs have also been given permission to re-open, again subject to protocols being put into operation.However, other sports remain shut down.Restrictions on Gaelic games are likely to stay in place until July  and there will be no inter-county games until October at the earliest.The start to the cricket season has been delayed, but this week the Northern Cricket Union said it hoped to be in a position soon to announce the first step in ato training..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th May 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Restrictions begin to ease  ","story":"THERE will be a major easing of lockdown restrictions across the district from today.A number of country parks, harbours, tennis courts and beach car parks will be reopened by Newry, Mourne and Down Council, but strict social distancing measures remain in place with the local authority warning thatthey are not observed, the facilities will be closed.The move to ease some lockdown measures comes after the local authority recently reopened the districtrsquos household recycling centres.But despite the easing of some measures, council campsites, public toilets and cafeacutes across the district remain closed, while mobile vendors are also banned from trading at beaches and forest parks.At last weekrsquos online meeting between the councilrsquos senior management team and the leaders of the local authorityrsquos main parties, agreement to start easing some of the lockdown measures was agreed.Also from today, mountain bike and horse riding trails and the car parks at Castlewellan Forest Park and Tollymore Forest Park will reopen.Public access to the forest parks was agreed two weeks ago, but the car parks remained closed, sparking complaints from residents who live close to both facilities about the number of cars parked along approach roads, hampering sight lines which posed a health and safety risk.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is taking direction from the Northern Ireland Executive on how it slowly starts to ease the lockdown, insisting that progress is determined by public health advice.Two weeks ago, the NI Executive published a five-phase blueprint for lting restrictions but it did not include a timeframe, insisting that it will be guided by scientic and medical advice before it agrees to lt any further restrictions.Local politicians say that they are keen to seen the pathway to recovery progressed, but are reluctant to move too quickly as the virus still has a presence.They are also conscious that with the warm weather predicted to stay, soaring temperatures could place pressure on the districtrsquos hotspots where visitor numbers could increase, as was the case in Newcastle last weekend.With the exception of people who are shielding, visits to immediate family are allowed indoors where social distancing is possible, with churches permitted to open for private prayer, with appropriate social distancing and cleaning of shared contact hard surfaces.However, with groups of four to six people who do not share a household now able to meet outdoors while maintaining social distancing, the local authority feels it is time to allow access to beaches, country parks, harbours and tennis courts.Politicians say they are conscious that easing the lockdown restrictions in one go could push up the all-important R-number, which measures the average rate of transmission.Councillors say the last thing they want is for a situation to arise which would result in having to reimpose lockdown measures and lose the hard won gains that have been made to date.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke and his Rowallane counterpart, Billy Walker, have welcomed the progress being made, but issued a reminder that there will be no leguard facilities at Tyrella beach. However, signs will be in place advising people where it is not safe to swim.The politicians say that council staff will be on duty at beaches, country parks and harbours to ensure required social distancing measures are adhered to. In addition, the number of visitors at the ious facilities will also be monitored, with staff carrying out regular cleaning duties.Cllr Clarke confirmed that local authority staff will be present to engage with the public around guidelines on social distancing and facility information.He said: ldquoWhile these measures will no doubt be welcomed, I would encourage people to be responsible and show consideration for others by continuing to follow the public health guidelines on social distancing and hand hygiene.Cllr Walker said the past two months have been particularly dficult for people across the district.ldquoIt has not been easy and we all hope that people will act responsibly when the beaches, country parks and harbours are reopened. The onus is on them to obey the rules in place which are designed to keep them safe and help prevent the spread of the virus, he continued.Cllr Walker said there were plans to put one-way systems in place, where appropriate, but that all public toilets would remain closed.He added: ldquoI hope that over the coming weeks other facilities will reopen. The fact that we can open beaches and country parks is as a result of local peoplersquos commitment to stay at home to prevent the spread of coronavirus.ldquoWe are making progress and for that to continue it is essential that people continue to adhere to public health advice.

I help my clients achieve their goals by finding that balancebetween nutrition, diet, and exercise.ldquoSome clients, and a lot of men actually, have come to me with problems with anxiety and gut health. For everyone to look after their gut health is something Irsquom verypassionate about.ldquoLast week was Mental Health Awareness Week and I would like people to understand the connection thatwe are feeding our bodies processed food, it can directly impact on our brains and our mental health.Apart from working on her own health and studying to understand what diet and nutrition works for her mdash shersquos vegetarian and stays away from grains, apart from oats and barley mdash Stacey was heavily influenced by holistic approach to health during her late fatherrsquos illness.Mr John Murtagh died in  at the age of  after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer.He was initially told that he has only six months to live and Stacey and her family believe that he helped extend his le through his devotion to nutrition, juicing, mediation and his deepreligious faith.ldquoOnce we heard the news, we researched everything we could to help him nutritionally and holistically, explained Stacey. ldquoWe believe  per cent his faith and his dedication to nutrition and meditation was definitely pertinent to his added time with us. His oncologists thought he was a miracle.ldquoI think it was through what we experienced with my father and my own journey that I knew I wanted to help others nutritionally and how to find their inner happiness and peace.In , she and her brother, Jonathon, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in memory of her dad to raise nearly pound, for Marie Curie.Staceyrsquos own gut health problems were finally diagnosed while she was working in Dubai where she was able to avail of private health service through her job.ldquoI eventually found out that I have visceral hypersensitivity which is typical of IBS and means that the nerves endings in my intestines are exasperated by stress, she said.ldquoMy doctor was very interested in holistic therapies and when he found out that I was doing a lot of HITT [high intensity interval training] but still not losing weight, he recommended switching to lower intensity training such as yoga and Pilates. The dference it has made to my le, along with yoga and a balanced nutritional diet had been incredible.According to Stacey, an open mind and a willingness to test out certain foods to see what triggers your condition are essential for clients to get the right outcome.ldquoJust traditional medicine alone ndash and I would never encourage anyone not to go with traditional medicine ndash is not always the answer. Itrsquos a partnership approach with traditional side and holistic. But most importantly its listening to your own body and what feels right, said Stacey.ldquoClients need to bring a huge trust in the coaching and we really need to work between three to six months and delve quite deep into the personrsquos le to see how we can work together.ldquoIrsquom a big advocate for staying away from fad diets mdash they never worked for me. I believe you have to work to be happy and content within yourself and this is helped by making the right lestyle choices for yourself. Itrsquos about finding balance and what works for you as an inidual and settling into that lestyle.After having a fixed-term contract as a marketing manager before the lockdown, Stacey is no longer working and thinks that this might be the time to push through with yoga and heath coaching full-time.While offering free online yoga classes , Stacey is also offering a complimentary -minute health coaching interview.For further information visit www. staceymurtagh..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th May 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

The Austin family and their pet pygmy goat‘‘He loves to be around me and it’s been so nice to have company like that!’’The benefits of pet ownership for health and wellbeing are well-documented, reducing loneliness and anxiety, lending daily structure, reducing stress and lting mood.And that’s in normal times. In lockdown, pets are proving a lesaver for many, providing companionship, consistency and happiness.Dogs in particular have helped to keep their owners active, demanding daily walks, pandemic or not.Co Antrim woman Valeria Higgins said working from home for the last two months has certainly brought many benefits.‘‘I see my husband and son far more than I used to and I get to share my work chair with a very annoying furry colleague who sometimes does not understand workplace etiquette - our cat Aussie.’’Valeria, from Newtownabbey, said she’s not sure who is benefiting more from having the other one at home all the time, the cat or her. ‘‘Aussie is definitely thrilled at having not one, but three, servants at her disposal throughout the day to attend to her needs,’’ said the -year-old.‘‘At  she is not as active as she used to be and mainly sleeps, eats, goes out for fresh air in the garden and sleeps again. ‘‘She is very vocal nowadays and does not hesitate to make her desires for food or cuddles known, and she does not care whether she is disrupting home schooling or my Zoom meeting .’’Valeria added: ‘‘I do find it great to have a pet at home at this time, we used to have two, but Aussie’s brother died last year. ‘‘To have Aussie sitting on my lap while I work from home is very calming and relaxing, and something that could never happen in the office.‘‘It helps to switch off when she is purring on my lap in the evening once everything is finally done and I can sit down and relax, or when she’s snuggled up next to me in bed.‘‘So many things have completely changed over the last two months. ‘‘I find that Aussie’s presence and her routine helps to keep a sense of normality and continuity from the BCera, her needs haven’t changed, her routine hasn’t changed and she’s enjoying the benefits that the lockdown has brought with it. ‘‘Maybe we should all be a bit more cat at this time – live in the moment, take cat naps and lounge in the sun.’’And, of course, creature comfort doesn’t necessarily have to come from cats and dogs - as the Austin family from Co Down can attest to, for they are the proud owners of five chickens and two pygmy goats. Dad Graham,, said: ‘‘We got the chickens about three days before lockdown. We were going to get them anyway. Then we got the pygmy goats last week.’’Graham and his we Jenny have three children, Sam, , Josh, , Lucy, ,‘‘The kids mentioned a dog, but we wanted some animals that don’t need too much looking after and to give the responsibility over to the children. And they have actually been pretty good, they go out every morning and let the chickens out and collect the eggs and once a week they clean out the coop.’’When it came to bestowing their pets with names, Graham said a certain US comedy show was the inspiration.‘‘There was a Friends theme,’’ he laughed. ‘‘The chickens are called Phoebe, Monica and Rachael and the other two chickens were named after our grannies, Gladys and Martha. The goats are called Gunther and Estelle, again following on the Friends theme.’’ Graham said the animals have proved a good distraction and interest for the children during lockdown.‘‘They would be outside a lot more than they used to - Lucy, especially. She actually climbed into the chicken coop and sat and had a wee chat with them!’’ And he said the kids are looking forward to training the goats. ‘‘You can train pygmy goats, like a dog, to sit and roll over and do a jump. You can also take them out for walks on a lead - we’ll take them down to Crawfordsburn Country Park some day,’’ he laughed.Graham and his we Jenny own a renewable energy company, Green Energy Store, but ended up on furlough during lockdown. ‘‘This meant we had plenty of time to get the coop and the pen sorted out the way we wanted them. We tried to get the kids to actively participate in building them as well,’’ said Graham.‘‘We live totally off grid, so getting the chickens was the next stage in teaching the kids a bit more about self-sufficiency when they collect the eggsthey’ll make omelettes and boiled eggs.‘‘The kids have taken a real interest in finding out more about the animals, they’ve been watching YouTube videos to see how to train them, what they like as treats.’’ During lockdown, some people without pets have decided to get one. Dogs Trust has reported a % increase in adoptions, but warned that “a dog is for le … not just for lockdown”.“We really need people to think about what might happen on the other side of this outbreak when people are hopefully back to their usual routines and have other commitments,” said the trust’s operations director, Adam Clowes.Dogs Trust has created an online quiz for potential new dog owners to test themselves on whether they are ‘dog ready’.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Unfortunately many other projects Ashling had planned for this year have currently been placed on hold.She said: “Last year I received an ACES award from the Arts Council and I’ve been using that to develop my own picturebook texts in Irish and English. The Covid- pandemic has meant that the publication of those is now delayed but on the positive side, it has given me the time to think about how my experiences and skills may be able to help others.”Thanks to the Arts Council and the National Lottery players Ashling is planning to develop a series of online videos showing the art process behind her work, painting, drawing, and printmaking.She explained: ‘‘The point of this project is to skill share, show some of the process, and engage with the community through free digital content that is easily accessible for people remotely.”Damian Smyth, head of Literature, Arts Council of Northern Ireland added: ‘‘Artists have been among the hardest hit groups, with projects delayed, venues closed and events cancelled for the foreseeable future. All of this is having a major impact on our cultural and creative lives. ‘‘Over the next few months, I’m really looking forward to seeing how Ashling’s project develops, encouraging others who maybe have an idea they wish to develop or perhaps want to reconnect with their creative side to, quite literally, get back to the drawing board.”*Ashling’s tutorials will be available on www.ashlinglindsay. \"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The former electrician and Royal Irish reservist then said: “There is still this accountability issue, this public interest and confidence issue that needs to be addressed. So do we need reform  Absolutely, yes – it’s the method and the travel of that reform that is the question.”For years, such comments have been common in off the record discussions with many DUP members at all levels of the party. But the DUP’s discipline, crucial to its electoral success, means that such strategic criticism is rarely articulated in public by DUP politicians. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...That was known across most of the party, just as Sinn Féin’s calculated decision to circumvent the law – effectively seeing itself as being above the law – on spads saw it appoint a ‘super spad’ to not only oversee its team of special advisers, but also manage its ministers.The RHI Inquiry which both parties opposed until public opinion forced each into U-turns exposed those situations and necessitated at least the appearance of such behaviour being recanted. Thus, when devolution ed in January, ministers and civil servants trumpeted new codes and mechanisms which they said would deal with such problems. But do they I have read the documents, discussed them with some of their authors and listened to those now arguing that they are adequate – but see no evidence that they contain the sort of tough sanctions which would make a repeat of the RHI scandal behaviour either impossible or highly risky for an inidual.Sue Gray, now permanent secretary in the Department of Finance, spent many years as one of the most senior figures in the Cabinet Office, giving her some authority when she says that Stormont’s codes are now the toughest in the UK.But Stormont had codes before – they were simply ignored. And, as is now apparent to many in London, in repeated Westminster scandals spads have been able to survivetheir minister backs them – and that is in a normal political system with an opposition, a powerful legislature and scrutiny by national media.In our system, with only % of MLAs not members of governing parties, we have a legislature which is almost indistinguishable from the Executive, there is no official opposition to scrutinise the Executive, and the media is rapidly shrinking – something likely to continue as the pandemic leads to further cuts in already shrunken newsrooms.The new codes for ministers and spads contain much common sense and little which in itself is objectionable – but it is what they leave out that is crucial.The simplest way in which to test the new system is to apply it to some of the behaviour exposed by the RHI Inquiry. For instance, Andrew Crawford, Arlene Foster’s spad for most of her ministerial career, was passing commercially-sensitive government documents to his relatives, alerting them that cash for ash was to end.More than that, he was passing confidential government documents to Gareth Robinson, the lobbyist son of the then First Minister, for his corporate clients – and was unabashed in telling the inquiry that he nepotistically treated Robinson Jr more favourably than other lobbyists because of who his father was.What would happen to a spad now acting as Crawford did  In short, nothing unless their minister withdrew protection from them.Those who endorse the new codes as adequate – and Sinn Féin in particular – suggest it is a great breakthrough to have claried that the minister is responsible for their spad, including for their discipline. In fact, it is nothing of the sort.Ministers have always been responsible for their adviser’s discipline and recent history shows that far from being a solution, that in itself is a problem. Ministers, whether because they have themselves authorised the wrongdoing, or because they fear what a spurned spad may reveal, or simply out of party loyalty, have far too great a vested interest to be independent arbiters of their closest aide’s conduct.When the then DUP minister Nelson McCausland’s spad Stephen Brimstone was implicated in the Red Sky scandal, officials investigated and recommended that he face disciplinary action. But McCausland used his power to ensure that did not happen, allowing Brimstone to remain untouched and then be promoted to the First Minister’s office.The hope of those behind the new codes seems to be that a minister will be embarrassed into action because there will be an independent report into the spad which will make a recommendation on disciplinary action and that will be published. Would a report manage to achieve what vast media coverage of an issue and demonstrable public anger had not  It seems highly unlikely.Mr Allister’s Functioning of GovernmentBill is far tougher and would put in place two new criminal offences.The first would outlaw any minister, civil servant or spad electronically communicating government business using personal email or other accounts – something which hides activity by keeping it off the grid and is critical to the continuation of the secrecy which some powerfulDUP and SF figures desire.The second new criminal offence would be for a minister or spad to send confidential government information to a third party. That could create an unintended impediment to whistleblowers, an issue which the committee seemed to agree needed an amendment to make explicit its intent to prevent behaviour such as that of Crawford.When the bill came before the Assembly at second stage in March, Sinn Féin immediately made clear its opposition – with John O’Dowd oddly even complaining about the fact that it was being tabled by a backbencher rather than an Executive minister, despite Sinn Féin TDs in the Dail having tabled legislation.At the time, Mr Frew – his party’s spokesman on the issue – said that the DUP endorsed the bill’s core principles. But earlier this month the head of the civil service said that Mrs Foster had since sold him that she opposed it.That is why Mr Frew’s forthright comments this week are intriguing. If even after the party leader has apparently made clear her changed stance, there is a split within the DUP on reforming Stormont, it has the potential to create something which, while hardly relished by Mrs Foster, could be to the benefit of her party.Until now, unionists who dislike the constant scandal which has infused Stormont in general and the DUP in particular have little option but to vote for another party –they vote at all. If a reformist wing – not pushing policy changes, but basic standards of good government – opens up within the DUP, it has the potential to undermine Mrs Foster in the short term but broaden the party’s appeal the long term – especiallythe reformers succeed.By contrast, there does not appear to be a single voice in Sinn Féin even questioning the toothlessness of Stormont’s new regime for spads – despite that party’s chest-beating rhetoric on putting manners on the DUP. While comforting for the leadership in the short term, that might ultimately not be in its strategic interests.Thank you for reading this story on our website.

presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

dutyOrangemen in Co Armagh have raised more than £, to help those fighting against coronavirus and those worst affected by lockdown.By Graeme CousinsThursday, th May , : pm\"\"Bessbrook District made a special delivery of a food pack to Bro Thomas Alderdice in Kilkeel : Other rd PartyDistrict and private lodges have provided food hampers for its own members and other vulnerable people in the community, donated to frontline NHS staff, raised cash for charity and boosted PPE provision in the area.Right Worshipful Brother Denis Watson, county grand master, said: “The money we’ve raised has gone towards assisting all communities and, as the largest community-based organisation within Co Armagh, it shows that the institution is so much more than just a parading body and has had a very positive impact in all areas of the county.“Almost as soon as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic became known and lockdown was implemented, the  district lodges and many private lodges in Co Armagh made spontaneous and impressive efforts to assist in their local communities.Rt Wor Bro Denis Watson, County Grand Master, and Wor Bro Jeffrey Lawson, Deputy County Grand Secretary, presenting the cheque for £, to Jane McKimm, Head of Communications, and Helen ONeill, Director of Finance.at the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, for specic use at Craigavon Area Hospital : Other rd Party“The tremendous response from the County Grand Lodge was immediate and the monies came from existing funds, with no member asked to contribute, unless to do so in a voluntary capacity.”Support included preparing food hampers for elderly and vulnerable brethren, and others in the community, making donations of food and goodies to frontline hospital staff, making monetary donations to charities, and providing PPE to nursing homes and community nursing services.A substantial donation of £, was made to the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, specically for Craigavon Area Hospital.Mr Watson said: “One of the first things put in place by the County Grand Lodge was the issue of a daily prayer from our County Grand Chaplain, Wor Bro Rev Dr Alan McCann, to members by email and posting on the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan’s House, Loughgall Facebook page.County Grand Lodge Officers made a donation of £, to the Southern Area Hospice as they are currently unable to fundraise, and this was presented to Anne Dalzell, hospice representative, at Sloan’s House : Other rd Party“The response has been very favourable in these trying times, with the daily reach on Facebook being between  and over ,.”He added: “The museum at Sloan’s House was very proud to display the Grand Lodge banner of support for the NHS and other frontline services on the front of the building and encouraged young people to send in rainbow pictures for display on the front windows of the premises. “The County Grand Lodge central committee has been able to liaise by having regular Zoom conference meetings and this has proved very beneficial in maintaining contact and co-ordination.” Reflecting on the work he said: “It’s a very commendable effort by the Orange brethren of Co Armagh and of course this is being replicated in other counties within the jurisdiction of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\"

GardensNewsPoliticsCouncil investigating possibility of holding virtual eventsArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough council will investigate the possibility of holding some of its events virtually.By The NewsroomThursday, th May , : pm\"\"The proposal to look at the feasibility of hosting certain events remotely was raised at Tuesday evening’s virtual meeting as members discussed a report recommending all Council led events are cancelled until the end of August.Council’s Head of Tourism, Artsand Culture, Brian Johnston, advised members there will be a further report in June that will give consideration to events held until the end of December .The report, circulated to members before the meeting, states that at present, events involving gatherings of people are not permitted and it is anticipated that when they are, other controls such as social distancing will be required.Some of the events recommended for cancellation include Buskfest in Banbridge Town Centre on June , Armed Forces Day in Banbridge Town Centre and Rugby Club on June  and the Seven Hills Blues Festival in Armagh which runs from August -.Other events for later in the year, including the Georgian Festival in Armagh and Halloween events across the borough and Christmas and twilight markets are all marked for further consideration.When asked by Banbridge Sinn Fein councillor, Kevin Savage why an estimate of council savings was not includedin the report Mr Johnston said Council would have spent £, on the events it now proposes to cancel.However, he did advise that not all of that will be saved by Council as some contractual obligations will need to be met.SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon raisedthe possibility of holding some of these events virtually.“We are encouraging businesses to do things online,” said the Armagh representative.“If we could look at some of these events happening between now and Christmas and seethere is an opportunity to do similar with them, could we have that explored and brought back in due course ”Lurgan councillor Liam Mackle said: “I would be very happy with some virtual events taking place in the months ahead.”The Sinn Fein representative then proposed that Council officers explore this idea and report back in due course with the proposal seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading
