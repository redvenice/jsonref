One claimed that he had to once wipe a \u0027substance\u0027 from the actor\u0027s face in a nightclub. It was also claimed that he spent the day \u0027smoking and drinking\u0027 on the set of City of Lies, formerly known as LAbyrinth, in which Depp plays a LAPD detective investigating the deaths of rappers Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur.             Possible explanation: Depp shaved his head and bleached his eyebrows to reprise his role as Grindewald in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. It wrapped filming in December and he has scarcely been seen since then . The film comes out in November           During his visit in Moscow, Depp also visited the Mayakovsky museum where, in one image, he looked happy and healthy as he posed with staff          A third image, taken in Moscow earlier in the week during a visit to a state museum, provoked more concern. Depp is pictured with one of the museum\u0027s staff The production wrapped filming last year and Depp was praised by some for his conduct on set including a handful of extras who said he \u0027couldn\u0027t have been nicer\u0027. It was however alleged that he asked a production staffer to punch him during one incident. According to sources cited by Page Six, Depp allegedly asked the staffer to punch him and said he would give him $100,000 to do so. His representatives did not comment at the time.             Depp is pictured in June, 2017, at Glastonbury festival in England when he had a full head of hair and fuller face           Depp is pictured with ex-wife Amber Heard in September, 2015.

Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron talk during a bilateral meeting at the G7 Summit in 2017What is the G7 Summit?Every year, leaders of all G7 countries meet to discuss important issues that are affecting the world and policy agreements that are made at the G7 Summit ultimately have a trickle-down effect on countries around the world.The location of the G7 Summit changes between the nations that are represented by their member and the leader of the hosting nation hold the G7 Presidency for that ear. It is their responsibility to host and organise the annual event and set the agenda.Where is the G7 being held in 2018?In 2018, the G7 Summit will be held on June 8-9 2018 in Charlevoix, Quebec, Canada with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the G7 President this year.          Leaders of the G7 countries seen here attending a working meeting at the G7 summit in 2015What will be discussed at the G7 2018 Summit?For this year’s G7 Summit, Justin Trudeau has set up ministerial meetings on five topics:1. Advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment2. Investing in growth that works for everyone3. Preparing for jobs of the future4. Working together on climate change, oceans, and clean energy5. Building a more peaceful and secure worldThe first of these goals is even more so poignant after Trudeau referred to himself as a feminist leader and the subject of gender parity is expected to be a dominant theme, across all five discussion topics.Alongside this, with perceptions of the US have fallen after 15 women came forward accusing Trump of sexual harassment, in addition to what was heard on the Access Hollywood tape, Trudeau has set up a Gender Equality Advisory Council.          George W. Bush, John Major and James Baker pictured at the G7 summit, when held in LondonWhat is the Gender Equality Advisory Council?Dayle Haddon, one of the 19 who make up what is being dubbed ‘The Council’, mentioned that private sector accountability and more investment in technology will also be main talking points on both days, according to Notable Life. ‘If you’re not being represented, complete decisions can’t be made.‘In matters such as creating future jobs, we need help designing what that landscape looks like when gender parity is incorporated. If the majority of people working on future-shaping technologies like AI are male, what they are creating will have a male worldview, which only enforces the problem.‘We need growth that works for everyone, and to do that we need to increase girls’ education levels in the technology and AI industries so they have access to these new jobs of the future,’ she said.The aim of the Gender Equality Advisory Council is to call on private sector companies to step up and eradicate this problem and The Council will look to organisations to publicly commit to achieving a gender-neutral board, with equal pay and equal leadership by 2020.‘The leadership qualities that Prime Minister Trudeau is manifesting are extremely impressive. It’s like Canada is standing up,’ Haddon said.How to Train Your Dragon 3: All you need to know about The Hidden WorldSnow Patrol tour 2018: All you need to know about the band\u0027s UK \u0026 Ireland showsTyson Fury v Sefer Seferi: What time is the fight, what channel is it on and what is the undercard?Who is Sefer Seferi?

It was established back in 1954 by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands.The elite group takes its name from Hotel de Bilderberg in Oosterbeek, the Netherlands, where it held its inaugural meeting on May 29, 1954, at the behest of Prince Bernhard. The group’s initial aim was to revive transatlantic ties between Europe and North America, as the United States and Canada had prospered as Europe, recovering from World War II and faced with the Soviet Union on its doorstep, had seen a rise in anti-American sentiment.The Bilderberg Group’s early leaders deemed its meeting necessary to strengthen North American and European ties as Cold War tensions escalated rapidly.Over the years, the group’s main goal has evolved to promote free market Western capitalism. However, given the powerful nature of attendees and the fact that its secretive annual meetings are held under Chatham House Rules – meaning that participants are free to use any information gleaned to them but are unable to ulge the identity of the person or group who gave it to them – the group has become the subject of many conspiracy theories over the years.When is the Bilderberg Group conference 2018?The Bilderberg Group’s 2018 meeting will take place from June 7 to June 10.Where is the Bilderberg Group conference 2018?The 2018 Bilderberg Conference will be held in Turin, Italy.            IMF director Christine Lagarde has attended the Bilderberg Group meeting in years pastBilderberg Group membersThe Bilderberg Group’s annual meetings have traditionally drawn many of the most influential and powerful political and business leaders from all across North America and Europe.The annual conference is usually attended by roughly 120 to 150 people, with the 2018 meeting slated to include 131 attendees. Just a few of the reported attendees for this year include tech entrepreneur Pete Thiel, King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, Colorado Governor and possible 2020 U.S. presidential candidate John Hickenlooper and many others.Influential political and business leaders who’ve attended in years past include former U.S. President Bill Clinton, businessman and philanthropist Bill Gates and International Monetary Fund director Christine Lagarde.Bilderberg Group conference 2018 agendaThe rise of populism in Europe is at the top of the Bilderberg Group’s 2018 agenda, a development not at all surprising considering the recent success of populist political leaders across the continent and the United Kingdom’s Brexit vote in 2016.Socio-economic inequality, trade, artificial intelligence and the implications of the upcoming 2018 midterm elections in the United States are also high on the powerful group’s agenda for this year.According to the press release, the following items are currently on the meeting’s agenda in order of precedence:1. Populism in Europe2. The inequality challenge3. The future of work4. Artificial intelligence5. The U.S. before midterms6. Free trade7. U.S. world leadership8. Russia9. Quantum computing10. Saudi Arabia and Iran11. The “post-truth” world12. Current eventsAs the powerful group’s meetings are always private and no minutes have traditionally been taken, the Bilderberg Group has become a favorite target of conspiracy theorists for decades.          A protester\u0027s sign is shown at the 2016 Bilderberg Group conference  in Dresden, GermanyBilderberg Group conspiracy theoriesThe secretive nature of the group and its powerful, elite members from around the world have attracted suspicion for decades and made it a prime target for various conspiracy theorists.Some have claimed that the group is ultimately trying to establish a New World Order, often claimed to be Marxist or fascist in nature. Radio host Alex Jones has been particularly vocal in his criticism of the Bilderberg Group, branding it as ‘evil,’ ‘ruthless’ and ‘puppeteers above the major parties’ in recent years.How to Train Your Dragon 3: All you need to know about The Hidden WorldSnow Patrol tour 2018: All you need to know about the band\u0027s UK \u0026 Ireland showsTyson Fury v Sefer Seferi: What time is the fight, what channel is it on and what is the undercard?Who is Sefer Seferi?

The knowledge is driving him to desperation. He\u0027s sure they are buried inside the home where he grew up in San Miguel Los Lotes, covered by ash that swept down the Volcano of Fire into this small community.Lying on his stomach, he reaches into a narrow space left between the top of a window and the tons of ash now filling the one-story house. The ash is almost up to the roof, and his efforts are so futile he stops and weeps softly.Hernandez was talking to his father, Margarito Hernandez, on the phone when millions of tons of volcanic ash tore through a hamlet sitting on the volcano\u0027s slope.\u0027He called me at 3:13 p.m. Sunday,\u0027 said the younger Hernandez, who was working in Antigua that day.\u0027The last thing he told me was to go far from here ... the last thing I could hear was him saying: \u0027Get inside!

Guatemalan authorities were warned to evacuate citizens from the danger zone surrounding a volcano more than seven hours before it eruptedGuatemalan authorities were warned to evacuate citizens from the danger zone surrounding a volcano more than seven hours before it erupted.Local newspaper El Periodico revealed that from 6:00 am on Sunday, the National Institute of Seismology alerted the National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction  about the impending eruption of Guatemala\u0027s Fuego volcano.During the following seven hours, until the moment of the eruption, the National Institute issued two further warnings which were not heeded by emergency response agency Conred.According to the newspaper it was not until 1.45 pm, nearly eight hours later, that the Disaster Reduction Coordinator finally raised the level of alert and urged sounded the alarm for evacuations to take place.  Mario Taracena, a senior opposition figure, wants Conred\u0027s boss dismissed and said the government should investigate whether there was criminal negligence.                         Guatemala\u0027s disaster agency, Conred, suspended the search several times this week, including for most of Thursday. Volcanic activity dumped more than a foot of additional rock and ash on the search sites between Wednesday and Thursday and officials worry downpours could destabilise slopes.Francisco Chavez showed up early with two sons, without tools, to check a collapsed house for a missing son, Edgar Otoniel Chavez, his wife, Sandra Hernandez, and their 4-year-old, Josue.At first they dug with bits of broken boards and sticks in the thick ash, now turned concrete-like by rain.Eventually, a few police officers took pity, and instead of running them off, lent them shovels and helped them in the desperate task of digging.But the huge ash field dwarfed their efforts, and the lack of government help angered them.\u0027They are cleaning the highway - the president has commitments to businesspeople.\u0027But here, since the people have nothing to offer him, he leaves this part as a burial ground,\u0027 said one of the sons, William Chavez, a 29-year-old accounting student.Anger was growing at President Jimmy Morales, who made only one brief visit Wednesday to the area. He didn\u0027t stop to talk to residents or reporters or offer much help. After a few minutes, his convoy sped off to a waiting helicopter.\u0027Why did the president come if he didn\u0027t bring anything?\u0027 said Gloria Esperanza Lopez, 35, who brought tamales to donate to residents and rescue workers, but wasn\u0027t allowed to pass a police checkpoint. \u0027How could he come with empty hands when we come with at least a tamal?\u0027At a shelter set up in a school in the nearby city of Escuintla, Nohemi Ascon, 41, waited Thursday. She is the aunt of six children aged one to eight who died in Los Lotes. A photograph taken shortly after the disaster showed their bodies huddled together on a bed in the corner of a room, covered in white ash and blood.She said other relatives are missing.\u0027My father, my mother, my sisters are there,\u0027 she said, upset over the decision to again suspend the official search.\u0027It is their job.

By comparison, Brando was nearly twice his size, hitting the scales at more than 15 stone (95kg). The archives show a who\u0027s who of acting legends, all white, considered for the role including Alec Guinness, Al Pacino, Albert Finney and Dustin Hoffman.In 1963, Attenborough wrote to Guinness, asking him to play the title role, however, Guinness’s agent replied in the negative, with the actor himself following up with a derisive comment about his portly physique: \u0027I’m too big, grey, fat and blue-eyed and would sound like Peter Sellers.\u0027          Gandhi director Richard Attenborough considered a who\u0027s who of acting legends including Alec Guinness, Al Pacino, Albert Finney and Dustin Hoffman          Richard Attenborough directing Gandhi, 1982Finney (The Bourne Ultimatum and Skyfall) also declined.

Hollywood icon Marlon BrandoThe hunt continued as the director realised the idea of having a white actor play the part of the Father of the Nation would not pan out. So, instead of choosing Brando, the actor famous for such films as A Streetcar Named Desire and The Godfather, Attenborough settled for Ben Kingsley, who he had seen in Bertolt Brecht’s Baal at the Donmar Warehouse.Riverdale producer signs a $400MILLION all-cash deal to stay...Shopfitters discover chest stuffed with £1m worth of...Share this articleSir Ben Kingsley, born Krishna Pandit Bhanji, was part Gujarati by descent.

It has since partly recovered as the ruble has strengthened, reaching nearly $90 billion last year.Russia has also increasingly turned to China as a market for its energy exports and a source of investment in infrastructure projects.Meanwhile, analysts remarked on the similar leadership styles of the men.Xi and Putin are \u0027soulmates who want to make their countries great again\u0027, Alexander Gabuev, senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, said.

The synod will include bishops from nine countries of the Amazon basin, including indigenous peoples\u0027One of the main points to be heard is the cry of thousands of communities deprived of the Sunday Eucharist for long periods of time,\u0027 the document says.Only priests can say Mass. The document calls for a \u0027process of discernment\u0027 within the Church to respond to the \u0027concrete realities of the Amazonian people\u0027.It says the Church presence in the Amazon basin \u0027has been spread precariously thin\u0027 because of the vast territory and its cultural ersity.The synod is expected to discuss the possibility of ordaining \u0027viri probati\u0027 - Latin for men of proven character - to deal with the shortage of priests. Such men would be elderly, outstanding members of the local Catholic community and with grown-up families.Pope Francis, in an interview with a German newspaper last year, said he was willing to consider ordaining older married men as priests in isolated communities.But he ruled out opening the priesthood to all married men or watering down the Catholic Church´s commitment to celibacy, seen as a virtue that frees priests to devote their lives fully to serve God.Pressed by reporters at a news conference about \u0027viri probati,\u0027 Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri said: \u0027The Church is not static ... there is possibility of movement.\u0027But he urged patience and caution. \u0027Let\u0027s leave the time necessary for reflection about everything that is in here.\u0027Some Catholic scholars have said the approval of \u0027viri probati\u0027 in the Amazon may eventually pave the way for their use elsewhere in the world as a response to the shortage of priests.The preparatory document also says that, given the size of the region: \u0027It is necessary to identify the type of official ministry that can be conferred on women, taking into account the central role which women play today in the Amazonian Church.\u0027The document did not elaborate. It ended with a 30-point questionnaire in which members of the Church in the Amazon were invited to give their opinion of the main challenges facing the area.

The airfield was abandoned following the ceasefire of the 1974 war and today stands derelict. Nicosia, the Cypriot capital, was ided into a Greek south and Turkish north area after the brief but devastating war of 1974          Definitely a no-go area: Rolls of sharp barbed wire prevents entry into the main hall inside the decaying Nicosia International Airport. Closed since 1974, Nicosia was the island\u0027s primary airport. It is now abandoned and located in the UN-controlled Buffer Zone which separates the Turkish-occupied north from the south. The airport\u0027s crumbling walls, barbed wire and deserted airfield are a far cry from its heyday, as the gateway to sun-filled holidays in Cyprus          Parts of this plane appear to have been shot at, and scavenged, while the elements have clearly also taken a toll. This picture shows the rusting, discoloured exterior of the fuselage of an Cyprus Airways Trident passenger jet parked on the tarmac of the long-abandoned complex. Nicosia International Airport was used as the island’s principal airport. However it was initially a military air base, and underwent expansion during the Second World War          You\u0027d need more than a mop here: Bird droppings cover nearly every part of the passenger departure area in Nicosia, Cyprus, while in the ceiling above, light fixtures have become rusty because of the lack of maintenance over more than four decades. It\u0027s hard to believe it was once a beacon for holidaymakers, who once flocked to the airport before journeying to and from holiday destinations at stunning resorts nearby. Local wildlife, however, is obviously taking advantage of its abandonment          No passports needed: This office has been boarded up for over 40 years now, with just the sign about the doorway showing its former life as the official border control post. Speaking about the 1974 invasion, Captain Adamos Marneros was flying when he saw Turkish warships approaching the Mediterranean island in an invasion triggered by a coup by Greek Cypriots aiming to unite with Greece.  The pilot recalled he \u0027couldn\u0027t allow myself to be frightened\u0027 because he had to land the plane safely     The former main terminal at Nicosia International Airport stands decaying inside the buffer zone on the southern, Greek side of the ided city in Cyprus. Capt Marneros, who was then a 27-year-old pilot with national carrier Cyprus Airway, said he had deep misgivings about making the flight to Nicosia. After a sleepless night in his London hotel room watching TV reports of the buildup to invasion, he pleaded on three separate occasions with the airline\u0027s boss to cancel the flight - to no avail          Spooky too: The former arrivals hall in the main terminal at the airport also looks bare, with debris covering the floor, while an old sign can be seen with the word \u0027Yes\u0027 to the rear, near passport control. Recalling his flight\u0027s approach to the island in darkness, Capt Marneros saw the hulking silhouettes of warships \u0027creeping\u0027 toward Cypriot shores. His warnings to the airport control tower were met with what he said were halfhearted attempts to ease his concerns          A dilapidated plane, lies abandoned on the tarmac. Capt Marneros was among the last to leave the airport during an evacuation. As he left in his car, he caught sight of Turkish paratroopers just north of the airport drifting down from the skies          \u0027I could see the paratroopers\u0027 eyeballs,\u0027 Capt Marneros said, \u0027and the guns strapped to their gear.\u0027 His aircraft, one of the airline\u0027s four Tridents, was later wheeled to the head of the runway in a bid to prevent Turkish planes from landing. It was promptly blown to bits by Turkish bombs          Nicosia International Airport was once the main airfield for Cyprus, but it has taken on a \u0027ghostly\u0027 appearance after being been shut to passengers for 44 years. Located near the Cypriot capital of Nicosia, this airport has not had a commercial flight since 1977 – three years after a coup d’etat by Greek nationalists and an invasion by Turkish forces          It\u0027s hard to fathom now, but this hole-strewn hallway in the arrival terminal was once part of a modern, new terminal designed by a German company, which opened on March 27, 1968. The new terminal could accommodate 800 passengers at one time and the parking apron eleven aircraft. Nicosia International Airport now stands thick with dust while old aircraft decay next to the landing strips outside in the largely disused airport located 8.2km west of the Cypriot capital city of Nicosia          Also abandoned, this is the former Nicosia International Airport control tower which has deteriorated dramatically since the the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. Currently, the runways and main airfield facilities are principally under the control of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force (UNFICYP) in Cyprus. The control tower is adjacent to the terminal building and two surviving aircraft, an Avro Shackleton and Hawker Siddeley Trident, which also lie derelict          A sign reading \u0027Tipping porters not allowed\u0027 has somehow remained upright, among rolls of barbed wire below a decades-old advertisement for Seiko watches inside the once state-of-the-art terminal. Once an emblem of the young republic\u0027s growing confidence just 14 years after independence from British colonial rule, the airport overnight became a symbol of a future hijacked by unresolved conflict. The airport was the scene of intense fighting during the invasion in 1974          This would have once been a bustling part of the terminal, where people gathered to grab a bite to eat, at the airport cafe. A bar can still be seen in the background, with a few dilapidated shelves and cupboards. During the invasion, Turkish forces tried to seize the international airport and effectively encircle the capital. Taking heavy losses, the attackers failed amid fierce resistance, prompting United Nations peacekeepers to take it over and declare it a U.N. protected zone          A sad sight: The shell of an airplane, which has been sitting for 44 years at the abandoned Nicosia International Airport in Nicosia, Cyprus. All that remains is the exterior of the plane, as the rest of its key features have been gutted for years. The airport\u0027s grounds remain the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force on the island and serve as the venue for U.N.-mediated reunification talks. Herders can sometimes be seen moving their goats across the airport tarmac          Debris and bird droppings cover what were once comfortable chairs for those visiting Cyprus, while the floor of the passenger departure area at the former airport is also a mess. Crumbling walls, with ripped cigarette advertisements, can also be seen in the background of Nicosia International Airport. Larnaca International Airport (LCA), a new airport, was opened in the Republic of Cyprus in 1975, after Nicosia\u0027s closure, while Paphos International Airport (PFO) followed in 1983            The former baggage claim hall at Nicosia International Airport stands decaying inside the buffer zone on the southern, Greek side of the ided city on March 7, 2017 in Nicosia, Cyprus. The airport was abandoned following the ceasefire of the 1974 war and today stands derelict. Nicosia, the Cypriotic capital, has been ided into a Greek south and Turkish north ever since the brief but devastating war of 1974. Since then United Nations peacekeepers have maintained a buffer zone          Smoke rises from bomb explosions during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus on July 20, 1974          The July invasion eventually resulted in some 3 per cent of the island being captured by Turkish forces before a ceasefire was announced, while about 37 per cent of the island was occupied in the second Turkish invasion the following month          Grief-stricken relatives contemplate the fate of their loved ones who have gone missing during the invasion          British troops hand out food rations to Cypriot refugees during the crisis          Desperate Islanders clasp photographs of their loved ones who have vanished since Turkey invaded Cyprus          Turkish troops during the July invasion.

That\u0027s taken me about five years.\u0027Despite having no background in model making, Mr Wrobel believe his design is the best in its scale.  He said: \u0027I have really gone to a lot of trouble going through old maps and drawings to get it right.\u0027I\u0027m pretty pleased with it in terms of its accuracy.\u0027 Mr Wrobel still has to act out the key moments of the battle and document it in his photobook.He said: \u0027I think that will take me a couple of years, and then when I am done I will do it all again but, but moving all the troops doing what in my view Napoleon should have done.\u0027So I will do my photobooks of what did happen and what might have happened.\u0027He said there are two professional models to rival his own - both in museums.But the scales are different, and while the most famous one at the National Army Museum, made in the nineteenth century, is much bigger, the characters are much smaller and it cannot be used for war gaming in the same way.           Figurines of French and English troops on the battle, as they would have been in 1815.

Such men would be elderly, outstanding members of the local Catholic community and with grown-up families.Pope Francis, in an interview with a German newspaper last year, said he was willing to consider ordaining older married men as priests in isolated communities.But he ruled out opening the priesthood to all married men or watering down the Catholic Church´s commitment to celibacy, seen as a virtue that frees priests to devote their lives fully to serve God.Pressed by reporters at a news conference about \u0027viri probati,\u0027 Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri said: \u0027The Church is not static ... there is possibility of movement.\u0027But he urged patience and caution. \u0027Let\u0027s leave the time necessary for reflection about everything that is in here.\u0027Some Catholic scholars have said the approval of \u0027viri probati\u0027 in the Amazon may eventually pave the way for their use elsewhere in the world as a response to the shortage of priests.The preparatory document also says that, given the size of the region: \u0027It is necessary to identify the type of official ministry that can be conferred on women, taking into account the central role which women play today in the Amazonian Church.\u0027The document did not elaborate. It ended with a 30-point questionnaire in which members of the Church in the Amazon were invited to give their opinion of the main challenges facing the area.

In the very early moments of the 14th last year, as the fire took hold, she was on the other side of London, celebrating with friends. As she got into bed, just after 1am, she checked her phone and saw the first pictures of the blaze that would kill 72 people, then just beginning to creep up from the fourth floor.“It was just so shocking,” Burke says. “This bloody tower block – it was devastating. We just sat there in the morning, for a good two hours, open-mouthed, watching the news.”Like many other Londoners, Burke spent the days that followed veering between righteous fury and grief for the victims. Burke grew up in council housing herself, in a 1920s tenement in Islington, north London, not far from where she lives today. “They were sort of nice,” she says. “We had a nice bit of green out the front. I had mates who lived in tower blocks and I always hated seeing them, because of the lifts, y’know? My God, so scary. It was similar to Kensington, because the very rich and the poor lived side by side.”Then came a fortuitous tweet. Paul Jenkins, someone Burke followed on Twitter (“because he’s very sweary, very angry, and I like that”), sent her a message. He had been speaking to Rhona Martin, a woman who lived with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and was worried about the survivors. Could they help?Mountains of food, clothes and toiletries were already piling up in town halls and churches. “We knew donating stuff wasn’t going to help, because they had too much. We had to look at the bigger picture, what we could do for the future,” says Burke.Jenkins and Martin suggested a book: 24 Stories, one for each floor of the tower. Twelve would be written by well-known authors – including AL Kennedy, Meera Syal, John Niven and Irvine Welsh – and 12 by newcomers. All were given the broad remit of hope, community and positivity. “We didn’t want it to be full of dark, depressing stories. We wanted it to be as uplifting as it could be,” says Burke.Only two of the stories mention Grenfell, the most explicitly connected being “Singing in the Dark Times”, Pauline Melville’s story of a homeless man navigating London after the tragedy. The other pieces are united by their shared humour and tenderness even Welsh, not known for “uplifting” writing, contributed “Seventeen-Storey Love Song”, about a woman falling off a New York rooftop – and yes, it does have a happy ending.“I remember watching the news for hours with my kids,” says Nina Stibbe, who contributed “The Language of Flowers”. “We were all devastated, by the idea of people dying in their flats. They still can’t stop talking about it. When we go to London, they ask, ‘Will we see that tower?’ It is deeply, deeply symbolic for people.”Two weeks after Jenkins messaged Burke, 24 Stories was launched on the website of the crowdfunding publisher Unbound in four days, the project was fully funded (with the help of JK Rowling and Gary Lineker) within another three weeks, they had 500 stories competing for the 12 newcomer spots. Burke, who was casting two plays at the time, helped whittle down a longlist of 60.Burke’s career has taken many surprising directions. She performed in 90s TV comedies Absolutely Fabulous and Gimme Gimme Gimme and starred in acclaimed dramas such as Mr Wroe’s Virgins and Gary Oldman’s film Nil by Mouth. At one point she quit acting altogether. In the theatre she recently directed Oscar Wilde’s Lady Windermere’s Fan and Sam Bain’s The Retreat, and she has writing credits to her name – so perhaps book editing is not such a great leap.All profits from 24 Stories will go to the Trauma Response Network, a charity set up after the Manchester bomb attack last year. “The survivors of Grenfell lost their homes, en masse, through no fault of their own,” writes neuroscientist Dean Burnett in the introduction to 24 Stories. “Many of them lost friends and loved ones, too, at the same time. They ended up with nowhere to go, no resources to fall back on and at the mercy of a system that clearly didn’t care and, from what we can see, still doesn’t. Not to have some form of PTSD would be more than unlikely – it would be borderline miraculous.”Burke is aware that her support of the charity may be construed as self-promotion, she says some celebrities were criticised for turning up in the aftermath, even with offers of money and donations. Stibbe feels the same: “I was a little nervous about getting involved, because you think, ‘Who am I to talk about this?’” she says. “People are going to say, ‘So, what have you done?’ I’m a writer. Kathy is a writer, actor and director. We do what we can.”“This was a great idea and we just ran with it,” Burke says, firmly. The hope, she says, is that people will buy it and fund the survivors’ treatment – and be reminded of what happened every time they glance at their bookshelves. “Seventy-two people died,” she says, “but hundreds of people are going to have to live with it for the rest of their lives” •"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bde33ec09a9d2de0d7cb11e3dd6072492687c83d/0_0_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b73c3cf44e1a625c98b3a5eb7af202a","title":"who said it germaine greer or morrissey","story":"Did these comments come from the Female Eunuch author or the man who wrote Girlfriend in a Coma?Beautiful icons of their time with radical agendas that inspired followers and fan devotion around the world, both Morrissey and Germaine Greer have recently been sounding more like that awkward relative you don’t want to be stuck chatting to on family occasions.Can you tell their comments apart?Here is a series of things they have either said or written over the last few years, but who said what?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4218e2eb858e41d80de4b60fb989939e30fc0ba1/52_39_3429_2057/master/3429.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=459566f8d5a3f4abefedd99492a7e359","title":"fca rule change to lure saudi aramco prompts criticism","story":"Businesses object as regulator paves way for London to host oil giant’s flotationThe City regulator has changed its listing rules, paving the way for London to host the stock market flotation of Saudi Arabia’s state oil company, expected to be the world’s biggest.However, the move by the Financial Conduct Authority was criticised by business leaders, who said they were deeply disappointed by the decision because it waives some rules on corporate governance.The regulator has created a new category with its premium listing regime to allow the state-owned company to list on the London Stock Exchange.Initially, the proposal had been for four of 15 rules to be waived to make a listing practical for a sovereign-controlled body. However, after a pushback, the FCA ultimately proceeded with two, rather than four, exemptions.The sop was not enough to appease critics, who acknowledged the regulator had taken onboard some of their concerns.Stephen Martin, the director general of the Institute of Directors, said: “The IoD is deeply disappointed that the FCA has decided to press ahead with the creation of a new premium listing category, which reduces key corporate governance requirements.“This decision has been made despite opposition from across the governance spectrum and without providing evidence as to the necessity for the reduction in standards.”The FCA defended the rule changes, saying the decision would encourage more firms to adopt the UK’s governance standards.Andrew Bailey, the regulator’s chief executive, said: “These rules mean when a sovereign-controlled company lists here, investors can benefit from the protections offered by a premium listing. This raises standards. This package recognises that the previous regime did not always work for these companies or their investors.”The IPO of Saudi Aramco had been planned for late 2018 but the Saudi energy minister recently confirmed speculation that the flotation was likely to be delayed until next year.

It is dirty and decaying, its maze of corridors a haven for drug addicts. Abel, who fled Eritrea 10 years ago, doesn’t like working here but says he does it for his kids.When architect Ram Karmi began work on the central bus station in 1967, it was to be one of the hallmarks of Tel Aviv: the largest bus station in the world, a brutalist colossus with seven storeys and a modern shopping centre and theatre. Karmi, who also designed Israel’s supreme court building and the third terminal of its main Ben Gurion airport, envisioned that two million people would pass through a year. He also designed it to be vast and confusing to navigate, thinking lost shoppers would spend more.But by the time it opened in 1993 following decades of delays, Tel Aviv’s centre had shifted north. The southern neighbourhood surrounding the station, long a gathering place for newly arrived migrants, was increasingly neglected. Today south Tel Aviv is regarded by most Tel Avivians as the underbelly of the city, and the station “the monstrosity.”The station’s ambitious vision and flawed realisation – and the way it reflects the priorities and problems of modern Israeli society – are the focus of Central Bus Station, a documentary by Czech director Tomáš Elšík. “I realised there’s a society inside the building,” he tells  Cities. “The building itself is empty without the people.” From the late 2000s on, the Israeli government began sending African asylum seekers straight from the border with Egypt to nearby Levinsky Park. They soon they made the neighbourhood theirs, much to the chagrin of other Israeli residents from marginalised communities, like the long-standing Mizrachi and newer Russian Jews. With the African and Asian people who work in the station largely shunned by mainstream society, the building fosters a community like no other in Israel. Amid the shops selling clothes and knick-knacks are a Yiddish book centre, a Filipino church, refugee health clinics, a military command centre. On Saturdays, when public transport shuts down for the Jewish Sabbath, the fourth floor transforms into a Filipino food market.Nearly two decades ago Yonathan Mishal, an artist and activist, started exploring the station and became hooked by its hidden urban subculture. “Little by little I started gathering information mainly by walking around and talking to people,” he says. “There isn’t any information where all of this is covered in one place.”Mishal and others in a collective offer tours of the station every Friday at 2pm, alternating weekly between Hebrew and English. Israelis do not consider their society to be as erse as the station shows it to be, he says. “When you think about Israeli society, of course it’s very erse, but no one thinks about it that way. People think you’re unified, you’re Israeli.”Mishal appears in Elšík’s documentary and praises the film as accurately capturing the “kind of weird” atmosphere inside the station, as though there is no sense of time or direction. He compares it to the military in that both are “connected to every part of society” in Israel. The station serves as a gathering point, bomb shelter and command centre for people during times of war, as well as a transit hub for soldiers passing through to their base, work or home.“In times of conflict it kind of transforms instantly into its military function,” says Mishal. “But it’s always in the background, like everything else.”Now there are plans to revitalise – and gentrify – south Tel Aviv, and local leaders want the central bus station closed in favour of smaller bus hubs around the city. But the “white elephant” won’t be budged: it is made from so much cement that it is next to impossible to safely and economically tear down.So the station will remain for the foreseeable future. It is “not only a weird space”, Mishal says at the end of Elšík’s film – the neglected urban space is also, somewhat paradoxically, a site of escape.“The central bus station is not interested at all in who you are or what you want to do,” he says. “It takes some effort but if you cross that line and step inside, you get an opportunity to have a safe space to be whoever you want to be.” Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0602adc3bb1f3cf5fb9a7ca9d3b9add0ac4ea53/0_67_2407_1444/master/2407.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0049589f139287781b8989cbec2ba63e","title":"paul dacre gone daily mail next associated newspapers","story":"Like all bullies, he targets underdogs – and those may soon include his successor at the paperAsked for the winning formula of his Daily Mail, Lord Northcliffe replied: “I give my readers a daily hate.” No one has kept that flame burning more brightly than Paul Dacre, poisoner of the national psyche, bully-in-chief, whose iron whim has terrified prime ministers for a quarter of a century, and who has announced he will be stepping down as the paper’s editor in November.Like all bullies he targets underdogs, imposing on the country racism, homophobia and philistinism, and shunning complexity and evidence. His sheer bully-power often frames the national debate by warping broadcasters’ news agendas, because they know the Mail makes politicians quake. Theresa May – his candidate – caves in to him every time, as paralysed on paying for social care as on Brexit. His legacy is the great Brexit ide that has torn the country in two.Decades of straight-banana EU fabrications and myths sowed the seeds, but nothing was as shocking as his front pages in the referendum run-up, filled with dark-skinned migrants making bogus claims, criminals and terrorists heading this way.Dacre defenders point to his championing of the murdered Stephen Lawrence – son of Dacre’s decorator – as if one case wipes clean the regular racist filth.With no compass as to where the true middle lies – it’s around £27,000 – his own £2.5m salary plus £1.4m bonus may skew his understanding. So may his Scottish estate, where activities include deer-stalking and grouse shooting, and his Sussex cattle farm, for which he draws bundles in EU agricultural subsidy.His political modus operandi is to go for the jugular, to play the person, not the ball. So when Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, expressed her members’ alarm at how a hard Brexit might kill their businesses, Dacre’s Mail did her over – and her family – in a savage double-page spread.It works: industrialists dare not put their head above the Brexit parapet for fear of the Mail lopping it off. When Gina Miller bravely went to the high court to secure parliament’s right to a Brexit say, he found no actual dirt, but called her “a gloating Guyana-born investment manager who alternates between glorying in self-promotion and complaining that her safety is under threat”. Thanks to Mail nastiness, she – like Stella Creasy and other Dacred women – faces death threats.Why do people – especially women – read it? There is a gobsmacking fascination with his outrageous headlines: how far will he go? Women are a favoured target, the Mail acting as playground bitch, forever papping celebrities putting on weight, spotted without makeup, revealing cellulite in a bikini. The case of the Royal Navy’s Faye Turney was a classic: after she was captured by the Iranians, the Mail joined the chequebook stampede for her story, offering – according to the defence department – “a very substantial sum”. But when she told her story elsewhere, Dacre took revenge, savaging her as an unfit mother: a picture of soldiers’ coffins bore the headline, “They won’t be selling their stories.”As editor-in-chief and chair of the Associated Newspapers board, his hot, fiery breath and sweary bollockings may bear down on his successor. As he reputedly frightens his proprietor, Lord Rothermere, Dacre may be the one to appoint an editor in his own image, just as he followed the moralising tics and toxic politics of his predecessor, David English.Optimists hope the sheer democracy-threatening anarchism of his recent assaults on the supreme court as “enemies of the people” has finally stirred Rothermere to rid us of this mania. The obvious replacement is the Mail on Sunday editor, Geordie Greig, friend of the Rothermeres and well-liked in moderate Tory circles. But long-term enmity between Dacre and Greig has exploded into print with the MoS’s robust remainer stance landing like an Exocet into the heart of Dacre’s daily.Who else? Mentioned is George Osborne, the London Evening Standard editor: Mail-hard on austerity, but like Greig sharing none of Dacre’s retro social conservatism. At least one cloud would be lifted: Dacre’s nostalgic miasma of an imagined 1950s in the days before orce, career women, single mothers, perverts and ethnic minorities caused our mortal moral decline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/430a091496123db4bce6265242beacd01a6605ca/1351_452_2690_1614/master/2690.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c2b15e80d7dfd018a580bd83f5fe88c","title":"brexiteers radical rhetoric tory brexit","story":"The revolution is being betrayed! That is the battle cry of the Tory Brexiteer ultras: that a dastardly counter-revolutionary assault on their sacred project is under way. Yesterday’s latest non-resignation by the Brexit secretary David Davis – having secured a time-limited backstop that the EU will never accept and that has no actual time limit – and his briefing against the prime minister for “Brexit backsliding” was the latest act in the Great Betrayal saga. That the Daily Mail will now be edited by a rightwing remainer rather than a rightwing Brexiteer has only added to the mounting panic. Then came the Boris Johnson leak: not only lauding Donald Trump and craving his approach to politics, but castigating the Treasury as “the heart of remain”.The Tory Brexiteers have dressed themselves in revolutionary garb, posing as insurgent Jacobins. “We have initiated revolution,” as Tory remainer Dominic Grieve bemoaned last year, “and the trouble with revolutions is you’re never quite sure what’s going to happen next.” Their opponents are “enemies of the people” and “saboteurs” and “traitors”. They claim the establishment is seeking to subvert the popular will. To be clear, I think it’s all nonsense – the Tory right are reactionaries, not revolutionaries, who wish to hand the economic elite more wealth and power through tax cuts, privatisation and deregulation. But by legitimising revolutionary rhetoric, they have helped the left more than they can ever know.How can the Tories pose as bastions of stability and order against the revolutionary menace of the left? That was, after all, their traditional posture. They wove a national myth about British exceptionalism, rooted in the 18th-century philosophy of Edmund Burke, that Britain repudiated radical change in favour of moderate gradualism, unlike the hotheads across the Channel. This myth airbrushed out the tumult and struggles of our history, but it served a purpose: to portray the left as somehow un-British, as alien to the national character. But on both sides of the Atlantic the right has adopted a revolutionary style, posing as insurgents against a corrupt, self-serving elite.Labour is run by genuine radicals, who want to end the 40-year-old neoliberal experiment and transform British society. Traditionally, the Tories would have presented this as a dangerous project that promised nothing but upheaval. They undoubtedly still will – but it can hardly pack the same punch, can it? That is no longer an option, is it? The Tory Brexiteers have not only made revolutionary rhetoric legitimate, they’ve made it almost compulsory in British politics. They have stopped the left looking dangerous, and so made a peaceful, democratic socialist revolution all the more likely.

This week the business secretary, Greg Clark, announced plans to pump £5bn into a new nuclear power station at Wylfa in north Wales. It was a reversal of a longstanding Conservative policy not to underwrite nuclear construction. So why the sudden enthusiasm? And what does Clark know that the rest of the world does not?For almost everywhere else, governments and corporations are pulling the plug on nuclear. Even in a world fearful of climate change, in which nations have promised to wean themselves off fossil fuels by the mid-century, almost no one wants to touch nuclear.US utilities are shutting reactors fast too, even those with years of their operating licences yet to run. In America’s deregulated energy markets, nuclear cannot compete. Last week President Trump called for the utilities to suspend closures, citing national energy security. He may resort to the law to get his way, but even Trump is not demanding new reactors.Meanwhile, the state-sponsored nuclear enthusiasm of China, recently the world’s premier builder, has dimmed. Beijing has issued no new construction approvals for over two years. Only Russia keeps up the momentum – which puts Britain in an embarrassing club.Britain hasn’t completed a new nuclear power station for 23 years. The government’s professed reason for its newfound enthusiasm is fighting climate change, and in particular the need to find replacements on the grid for the remaining coal-fired power plants that it has pledged to shut by 2025. But while the cause is correct, the solution is increasingly at odds with the rest of the world.Yes, nuclear is a proven large-scale source of low-carbon electricity. But renewable sources like solar and wind are both now cheaper, and are becoming cheaper still, while nuclear costs only rise.Some who call themselves “eco-modernists” argue that nuclear and renewables would make a great mix: nuclear could fill in when the sun goes down and the winds drop. But there is a problem. Any effective stand-in for fickle renewables needs to be available at the flick of a switch. Hydropower or natural gas can do the job, but not nuclear. Its forte is to deliver constant baseload power.If nuclear ticked enough other boxes, it might still have a role to play in keeping the lights on. But it has always been a bad neighbour and troublesome citizen. Some of our fears about radiation may be exaggerated, but they are real fears nonetheless. And nuclear power’s links to nuclear weapons are not just about shared technology – at least not while Britain remains home to the world’s largest stockpile of plutonium.We are sitting on 130 tonnes of a human-made element that lies at the heart of most nuclear weapons. The stockpile is at a warehouse at Sellafield in Cumbria, in defiance of warnings from scientists at the Royal Society a decade ago that in its present form it poses a major security risk, whether erted for weapons or breached by terrorists.The plutonium was manufactured over decades from used power-station reactor fuel. Britain wanted to be at the forefront of a new global industry using plutonium to fuel new designs of reactors. But production continues even though there is no sign of a world market for plutonium. And neither the new Hinkley Point reactor under construction in Somerset, nor the proposed plant at Wylfa, will burn the stuff.The government seems determined to pursue a nuclear dream, even though it has palpably failed to come to terms with the toxic legacy of the country’s nuclear past.Next to the site of the planned Wylfa plant sits the shell of an old nuclear power station. It was shut in 2015, but is not scheduled for demolition for almost another century, in 2105. It is one of 11 former plants that sit abandoned around our coastlines, from Dungeness in Kent to Trawsfynydd in Snowdonia, and Sizewell in Suffolk to Hunterston in south-west Scotland.They are currently being put into what the industry terms “care and maintenance” – mothballed while their radioactivity decays, and until the government’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority can find somewhere to put their remains.On present form, that day may never come. Britain is today no nearer agreeing a final resting place for its most dangerous and long-lasting radioactive wastes than it was back in 1976, when the royal commission on environmental pollution said we should build no more nuclear power plants until that problem was resolved. Absurdly, the most recent plan has been to bury the waste in tunnels to be dug beneath the Lake District national park.Nuclear power today is a largely friendless industry: uneconomic without heavy government support, uninsurable, stuck with a military heritage from hell, overtaken by cleaner competitors, beset by waste problems that no one has resolved, and always vulnerable to public panic after the Chernobyl or Fukushima accidents.Some believe it may have a future when the waste problems are resolved and if radical new reactor designs emerge. That may be so. But the truth is that in the 60 years since the bomb-makers first promised us “atoms for peace”, nuclear power has gone from a sunrise to a sunset industry. Only the British government seems not to realise it.• Fred Pearce is the author of Fallout: A Journey Through the Nuclear Age, From the Atom Bomb to Radioactive Waste "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a778b30b89287ecffd1cdbfab88b2f2f2cae4ced/0_94_3786_2272/master/3786.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea3eef7c36360a62cf60e140f5f67e87","title":"save planet meat dairy livestock food free range steak","story":"Farming livestock for food threatens all life on earth, and ‘free-range’ steak is the worst of allWhether human beings survive this century and the next, whether other lifeforms can live alongside us: more than anything, this depends on the way we eat. We can cut our consumption of everything else almost to zero and still we will drive living systems to collapse, unless we change our diets.Whenever I raise the crucial issue of yield per hectare, I receive a barrage of vituperation and abuse. But I’m not having a go at farmers, just pointing out that the figures don’t add up. We can neither feed the world’s growing population nor protect its living systems through animal farming. Meat and dairy are an extravagance we can no longer afford. There is no way out of this. Those who claim that “regenerative” or “holistic” ranching mimics nature deceive themselves. It relies on fencing, while in nature wild herbivores roam freely, often across vast distances. It excludes or eradicates predators, which are crucial to the healthy functioning of all living systems. It tends to eliminate tree seedlings, ensuring that the complex mosaics of woody vegetation found in many natural systems – essential to support a wide range of wildlife – are absent. Unless you can cook well – and many people have neither the skills nor the space – a plant-based diet can be either boring or expensive. We need better and cheaper vegan ready meals and quick and easy meat substitutes. The big shift will come with the mass production of cultured meat. There are three main objections. The first is that the idea of artificial meat is disgusting. If you feel this way, I invite you to look at how your sausages, burgers and chicken nuggets are currently raised, slaughtered and processed. Having worked on an intensive pig farm, I’m more aware than most of what disgusting looks like.This could also be a chance to break our complete dependence on artificial nitrogen. Traditionally, animal and plant farming were integrated through the use of manure. Losses from this system led to a gradual decline in soil fertility. The development of industrial fertilisers saved us from starvation, but at a high environmental cost. Today, the link between livestock and crops has mostly been broken: crops are grown with industrial chemicals while animal slurry stacks up, unused, in stinking lagoons, wipes out rivers and creates dead zones at sea.

It disproportionately affects children and poorer Londoners.Khan said: “Tackling London’s lethal air and safeguarding the health of Londoners requires bold action. Air pollution is a national health crisis and I refuse to stand back as thousands of Londoners breathe in air so filthy that it shortens our life expectancy, harms our lungs and worsens chronic illness.”Unveiling the plans at a London primary school on Friday, the London mayor announced a four-year study looking at the impact of toxic air on the health of 3,000 primary schoolchildren.The project, led by scientists at Queen Mary University of London, will compare the health of children in the capital with those in polluted areas of Luton where there is no low-emission zone planned. Children are especially vulnerable to traffic pollution, with evidence showing stunted lung growth in polluted areas worldwide, leaving them at risk of lifelong breathing disorders and earlier death. Pollution also triggers asthma, asthma attacks and chest infections.Once the zone is extended to the North Circular and South Circular, it will cover a huge area of London, and officials estimate 100,000 cars, 35,000 vans and 3,000 lorries will be affected per day.It will also include a “particulate matter standard”, after the  revealed every part of London exceeds World Health Organization air quality guidelines for PM2.5 – the most dangerous particulate.Paul Morozzo, a clean air campaigner at Greenpeace, said: “It’s going to have a huge impact on air quality and make a real difference to Londoners’ quality of life. London is leading the way in tackling harmful air pollution.”The government is being taken to the European court of justice for failing to tackle illegal levels of air pollution, and Morozzon said its response to the crisis had been “shameful”.“The government must fund and support cities around the country to offer the same level of protection as London. People everywhere have a right to breathe clean air,” he said.Environment lawyers at ClientEarth, which has defeated the government three times over its air pollution plans, said “political leaders across the UK should take note”.But James Thorton, the organisation’s chief executive, said the London mayor should go further. “A stronger, bigger ultra-low emission zone, brought in sooner, would be key to tackling the illegal and harmful levels of air pollution found across the whole of Greater London,” he said.The charge in the central London zone and extended area will operate all day, every day. Drivers within the expanded zone using “non-compliant” vehicles will pay a daily charge of £12.50.Khan will also tighten standards for the most polluting heavy vehicles, including buses, coaches and lorries, across the whole of London from October 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e87f81d323dfcc986e5489db0a28af023925563/0_219_6580_3948/master/6580.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67fb849648c8c97707781109992d91d3","title":"the wild workout a yorkshire coastal adventure","story":"The North York Moors national park hugs a coastline made for adventurers and the curious. Sarah Wharton tries her hand at foraging, fossil hunting, hiking and stand-up paddleboardingStay over in StaithesThe eclectic personality of Staithes reflects residents past and present. In the jumble of tiny cottages that spill down a gorge to the harbour have lived James Cook (later Captain), who came to work in a grocer’s store, and the influential Staithes group, a 19th-century artists’ group. It’s home to the Staithes festival of arts and heritage in September, and is a shoo-in for basecamp on a trip that takes in culture, natural history and a yomp. Rest up at the Endeavour B\u0026ampB, where host David Linley is a walking encyclopedia of activities, and heritage tales. He makes a mean breakfast too: don’t miss the kippers from Staithes’ own smokehouse. For dinner, try the delicious crab salad at the Royal George – like all pubs in this fishing village that’s something of a sovereign state, it’s independent and family owned. And if food and flavours really are your thing, then book a day of coastal foraging and cooking tips with Taste the Wild, which runs courses out of Staithes. Co-founder Chris Bax says: “Foraging reflects the resurgence of ersity in food: we let people rediscover things we used to eat but have dropped out of fashion.” The Attenborough in all of us will want to get closer to wildlife in an area rich in flora and fauna from moor to sky to sea. Jump aboard a birdwatching and cetacean safari with ecologist Richard Baines at Yorkshire Coast Nature (YCN) and you might just see some minke whales. Or stay grounded and snap up a seabird photography workshop with YCN’s Steve Race. Find your waveStand-up paddleboarding is “surfing without the faff of having to get up while the wave is breaking all over you,” says Simon Palmer, explorer, who co-founded SUP Adventures with Dan Fawkes. Both have that ex-military knack of turning what should be a gruelling encounter – with messy sea, two left feet or black skies – into a fun escapade and day-long grin. “People love it because it’s so accessible, irrespective of ability. It’s a terrific confidence booster if you’re anxious about getting out to learn a new activity or getting in the water. And it’s an all-body workout too.” Conquer position, posture and paddling technique at postcard-pretty Sandsend or alongside Saltburn’s trim, elegant Victorian pier. Then treat yourself to a follow-up session to learn how to read wave conditions and ride on to the beach. For something more stretchy, try SUP Adventures’ river yoga. Determined to have a Point Break moment? Head for surf spots at Staithes, where the rock bottom breaks produce powerful and defined waves (experienced surfers only). Or dip a beginner’s toe at Whitby’s West Cliff beach with Whitby Surf School. Hike into natureIf watersports aren’t your thing, then hiking along this extravagantly handsome Jurassic coastline, creaking with 200m years of stories, puritanical Victorian glamour and fishing folklore, will definitely get your heart rate up. North Yorks Moors senior ranger Bernie McLinden offers some tips: “Hayburn Wyke is a fantastic place to get to,” he says, referring to a secretish cove at the southern end of the North York Moors national park. “I was there at 7pm last night and even spotted a couple of surfers: they seemed to be having a great time.” With a waterfall that plops on to the beach, it’s a fairytale scene to take in on a circular five-mile walk that goes south along the Cleveland Way and returns along part of the Cinder Track, a defunct 21-mile railway line from Whitby to Scarborough that’s great cycling too. Another inspiring journey is the “source-to-sea” hike that picks up the river Esk at Westerdale Moor and closes at Whitby’s harbour mouth. At 37 miles, the full walk takes three or four days, but the Esk Valley railway enables you to cheat and do a day’s chunk to suit. “You might be lucky enough to see an otter along the way,” McLinden says. “At Sleights, if it’s the right time of year, you can see salmon leap. And in springtime, the woodland areas across the park are just wonderful, brimming with the beauty of the bluebells, primroses and ramsons.” Back in Staithes, if you have just 15 minutes to spare you can sprint southwards then upwards on to the cliff and a new part of the England Coast Path, to get the best view of the waterside hamlet. If you have longer, plump for a four-mile circle, taking in the industrial ironstone past of Port Mulgrave. Paddle back in timeThe Dinosaur Coast has never been more alive than when kinetic geologist, marine biologist and sailor Peter McGrath is talking about the natural kingdom that surrounds smartly turned-out Runswick Bay. He says: “One of ‘my’ best finds in 40 years came from my daughter Ruby on one of her first fossiling trips. ‘I’ve found an ammonite,’ she shouted casually. Not just any ammonite! A rare 18cm Hilderocas bifrons is a very good find.” McGrath is on a mission to discover and photograph every fossilised and living thing he can in the area, and shares his vast expertise with interested visitors as part of local firm Barefoot Kayak’s fossil foray team. If McGrath is the vim in this expedition, topping up your knowledge of fossil poo and Devil’s toenails (coprolites and Gryphaea respectively), Barefoot Kayak’s founder, paddlesport guide and coastguard Andy Monaghan provides the calm – putting the newly waterborne at ease with a deceptively laid-back style that nails safety. Paddling along with the duo is relaxing and stimulating in equal measure. Sea kayaking is manageable for most people and great for independent travellers or family groups with a yen for adventure.

The film is about the Mongol Derby, a brutally punishing 1,000-kilometre endurance race across Mongolia, recreating Genghis Khan’s 13th-century horse-messenger trail.Riders have to use the wild horses they’re given and ride all day for about 10 days, changing mounts every 40 kilometres. They are intensively tracked and monitored with GPS, with hyper-alert support teams of doctors and vets, although psychotherapists would probably also be a good idea. The contestants face tough terrain, the possibility of encountering wolves and probableinevitable injury – or, as someone cheerfully puts it: “faceplanting”, which could lead to broken necks. It looks as terrifyingly dangerous as the TT races in the Isle of Man.There have been Mongolian competitors in the Mongol Derby but by and large the riders seem to be from Europe, America, Britain and Ireland, and there is, just possibly, a quasi-colonial experience in the race, although it is more nuanced than this: a black South African rider’s presence complicates this impression. One rider says: “You don’t want to go through this so quickly – you don’t enjoy the culture and the landscape.”Perhaps there’s simply no other way to get through it – though Ivo Marloh’s camera gives some sense of the pure daunting vastness of the setting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/322d4e779f640b72d608276e1326a4831eb0c55a/87_43_4927_2956/master/4927.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90d1b7e72b90dd5ee8ee297076cd9e6d","title":"liverpool set to complete signing nabil fekir lyon","story":"• Lyon deny agreement but deal expected to go through on Friday • France international set for medical on FridayLiverpool are set to complete the signing of Nabil Fekir on Friday after meeting Lyon’s €60m (£53m) valuation of the France international.Despite Lyon issuing a strongly-worded denial on Friday morning, Fekir is on the verge of becoming Jürgen Klopp’s second major transfer of the summer, with Anfield officials having agreed a deal worth an initial €55m to the French club plus €5m in bonuses. The Lyon captain has informed his boyhood club of his preference for Anfield and the deal is expected to be finalised before the 24-year-old heads to the World Cup.“The information on the transfer of Nabil Fekir is false,” read the statement from Lyon. “Olympique Lyonnais categorically denies the false information disseminated by many media about the transfer of Nabil Fekir to Liverpool.“In this period of transfers where the slightest rumour is often presented as a reality, Olympique Lyonnais reminds that only the information disseminated by the club on its website is authentic.”Jean-Michel Aulas, the Lyon president, told his club’s website on Thursday that the deal was “at a standstill” and unlikely to be concluded before the World Cup. Liverpool, however, continued to press ahead with negotiations and appear to have broken Aulas’s resolve to keep the attacking midfielder until after the World Cup in the hope of starting an auction.Fekir is due to undergo a Liverpool medical at Clairefontaine, the France national team’s training base, before signing terms on Friday. Didier Deschamps’ side play their final World Cup warm-up game against the USA in Lyon on Saturday and the manager had instructed his squad to settle any outstanding transfer business before flying to Russia.Liverpool have already signed the defensive midfielder Fabinho from Monaco for £43.7m and Naby Keïta will arrive from Red Bull Leipzig this summer for £52.75m. They have also registered interest in Xherdan Shaqiri, who is available for £12m-£13.5m after Stoke City’s relegation from the Premier League.Bayern Munich and Atlético Madrid have also been linked with Fekir, who can operate in a number of forward roles and would in effect be Philippe Coutinho’s replacement at Anfield. But his determination to join Klopp’s team and Liverpool’s willingness to go to €60m appears to have altered the stance of the Lyon president."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97036444b1bd1e5f0bfed105fd89835df1244e73/155_203_2405_1443/master/2405.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0100561274e9d2dd90b06702d9f9d38c","title":"juan sebastian veron picks his all time argentina xi","story":"Could Messi and Maradona have played in the same team?

One of those players who represents our notion of a modern player a ball-playing goalkeeper, a modern goalie who can play with his feet.At right-back, Eduardo Luján Manera – someone whose speed and headers were widely acknowledged as contributing factors to the success of the Estudiantes de La Plata team that in 1967 became the first small club to win a professional tournament, and who won the Argentine Primera with the club as both player and manager. Daniel Passarella, for sure, undisputedly one of the best world-class central defenders of his generation, if not of all time, and Dr Raúl Madero, a former physician – again, I did not see him play but because of my old man I feel familiar with his style. A modern central defender great timing, good technique, was able to dribble … everything that one looks for now in a central defender, he already had 50 years ago. It is difficult to find the last defender … El “Negro” Aguirre Suárez – a full-back and an assassin, bien rústico (agricultural). In front of the back four I want a “double No 5” with Juan José López – JJ López – one of those mixed midfielders, with a lot of technique, the genetics of a No 8 that can do both things, attack and defend. He is the emblem of that type of No 8, alongside Fernando Redondo, who I played with in the national team. As a complement to JJ he is a No 5 that can do everything: a marker, dribbler, he’s able to sneak in a ‘filtered pass’ and freely roam the midfield. Just in front, Omar Sívori, the fantasist. It could equally well have been Di Stéfano but I’ll go for Sivori – an all-terrain player the sort that would get hold of the ball in the centre of the pitch and lead it right into the back of the net.Then, categorically and without any doubt, Lionel Messi and Diego Maradona – both have to be in. Can I imagine them playing well together? Yes. And finally, the 11th man, the striker Manuel Pelegrina – not just because he’s ‘pincha’ (an Estudiantes fan) he was captain at the 1930 World Cup, top goalscorer for Estudiantes and the national squad, and nowadays we talk so much about the importance of education – well, he quit football to sit the exam that would complete his schooling and then returned to play at the World Cup … an example on and off the pitch, then and now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ac1a3e559f2571f5c3341e5fa76a98ecf1ff921/1875_160_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f09b4640fb95e5afb9df1657fc4ee56b","title":"david squires on england world cup history","story":"In an extract from our 100-page World Cup guide, available in the  this Saturday, we follow the scarf from glory to disaster via Greaves, Gazza and Brexit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/122a7504981104c4d8f9a3be1c281b3f13082e53/0_245_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67b10897bf7097015ac6a2e18869be6b","title":"the unspeakable truth about slavery in mauritania","story":"For all the government’s denials, slavery persists in Mauritania.

While there, he was arrested and imprisoned by police, who confiscated his memory cards, phone and laptopSlavery has a long history in this north African desert nation. For centuries, Arabic-speaking Moors raided African villages, resulting in a rigid caste system that still exists to this day, with darker-skinned inhabitants beholden to their lighter-skinned “masters”. Slave status is passed down from mother to child, and anti-slavery activists are regularly tortured and detained. Yet the government routinely denies that slavery exists in Mauritania, instead praising itself for eradicating the practice.Members of Mauritania’s leading anti-slavery organisation, the Initiative for the Resurgence of the Abolitionist Movement (IRA), hope to oust the majority Arab-Berber government in national elections next year. The IRA leader, Biram Ould Abeid – a former slave who was imprisoned for years before coming second in 2014’s national elections – has vowed to remove President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, who came to power in a 2008 coup and has since dismantled the Senate in what critics see as a bid to broaden his powers.Fatimatou and her daughter Mbarka, above, were slaves to a family in the Aleg region, roughly 250km from the capital, Nouakchott. “They called me ‘Fatma the servant’: I looked after the cattle, prepared food, and fetched water from the well,” says Fatimatou. “I lost two babies to this family because they prevented me from taking care of my own children. I was forced to work when I had just given birth.” Fatimatou was freed with her children in the early 1990s by the organisation SOS Slaves. Today, she lives with her family in one of Nouakchott’s working-class neighbourhoods.Former slaves Habi and her brother Bilal, above left, stand in front of Bilal’s garage outside Nouakchott. The siblings were both slaves to a family east of the capital, but Bilal fled suddenly one day after his master beat him. After several attempts to rescue his sister, who was a victim of sexual abuse and forced labour, she was finally freed with the help of SOS Slaves in 2008. Today, the pair live in a poor neighbourhood on the periphery of Nouakchott. With the help of some activists, Bilal recently opened a small tyre-mounting garage.Mauritania is a bridge between the Arab Maghreb of north Africa and darker-skinned sub-Saharan Africa. The ruling Arab-Berbers have higher paid positions in jobs and government, while the darker-skinned Haratines and Afro-Mauritanians are under-represented in leadership positions and face many obstacles in society, from access to education to well-paid jobs.Haratines do many jobs that Arab-Berbers consider dirty or degrading, such as working in local markets. Sos Slaves provides workshops to help empower Haratine women, most of whom are unemployed, poor and have little or no education. Some workshops teach recently freed slaves about money – what it is and how it is used – while others teach Haratine women skills such as embroidery or sewing, which help them to earn money for the first time in their lives.Mabrouka, 20, was a child when she was taken from her mother, also a slave, to serve with a family in the south-western Rosso area. Around the age of 11, when she was cooking for her masters, she was badly burned on her left arm. She still suffers from the pain. Mabrouka was 14 when she was freed in 2011, but was never able to go to school. She got married at the age of 16 and is now the mother of Meriem, four, and two-month-old Khadi.A Tarhil neighborhood resident outside her house, where she was relocated by the state when her slum in Dar Naim was demolished to make way for the construction of a road. Married, with two children, she sells biscuits to passersby while her husband holds small jobs in the city. “If we had the budget, we would have rented a room in Nouakchott. Here, we don’t even have water – we have to pay for a cart to deliver water,” she says.Haratines work in certain professions that are designated for their caste alone, such as butchery and rubbish collection. Above, on the left, men at a slaughterhouse prepare cattle for sale in Nouakchott. The picture on the right shows Youssef, 18, who is in his third year of secondary school in Nouakchott. A few days a week he works as a rubbish collector to help support his family.Moctar was born into slavery in an Arab-Berber family, where he was forced to work alongside his mother and brother. In 2012, after several attempts, he managed to escape and met an activist from the anti-slavery movement. He tried to liberate his mother and brother, but they refused to go with him. His mother even criticised his escape and testified against him. “When I was younger, my mother told me every night that we must respect our masters, because their caste is higher than ours, and they are saints,” says Moctar. He started school at 13 and hopes to become a lawyer, in order to fight for the rights of the Haratines.Meryem (in blue) lives in Znabeh, a small village comprised of former slaves. In 2014, following the death of their father, the children of slavemaster Sheikh Mohammed freed four women and their children: Meryem, Aïcha, Beïga, and Merine. They all fled with their children and grandchildren and settled near a water source. They now survive off of their small holding and the little food it brings.Salma, above right, served for more than 50 years as a slave in a white Moorish family in northern Mauritania’s Chagar region. Her children were also born into servitude.In 2013, Salma and her daughter Yema were released by her two sons, Bilal and Salek (pictured above), who had escaped a few years earlier. But Yema twice ran back to her master’s family. Today, she is married and has two children. Salma, Yema and her brothers now live together in a slum in Dar Naim.Aichetou Mint M’barack was a slave by descent in the Rosso area. Like her sister, she was taken away from her mother and then given to a member of the master’s family to be a servant. She got married in the home of her masters and had eight children, two of whom were taken away from her to be slaves in other families. In 2010, Aichetou’s older sister was able to free her with the help of the IRA Movement, after she herself fled her masters when they poured hot embers over her baby, killing it. Aichetou and her eight children are now free and live together in Nouakchott.Jabada, below, is over 70. She fled her master after he tied both her hands to a tentpole, which cut off one finger entirely and deformed the others. She is now unable to use her hands. Taken in by another family who helped heal her wounds, Jabada stayed with them until her freedom in the 1980s. She now lives with her children and grandchildren in one of Nouakchott’s poor neighbourhoods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/333257b4c6ed496dc2d34aed6deae03f7500d7ea/0_216_4071_2443/master/4071.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a47e652be68c8b666f4c2d25a57a8d3","title":"most lawyers recommended to be judges went to state schools data shows","story":"Figures for England and Wales show greater social mobility but racial ersity ‘not happening fast enough’Almost two-thirds of lawyers recommended to become judges in the past year attended state schools, according to the first social mobility statistics released by the judicial appointments commission (JAC).The figures for England and Wales suggest the judiciary may be undergoing a gradual transformation despite criticism that solicitors and those from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds are not making significant advances.Traditionally, most judges have come from the ranks of barristers but there is increasing resentment among solicitors that they find it far harder to make their way on to the bench.Andrea Coomber, director of the legal reform charity Justice, said: “While the statistics paint a more encouraging picture for appointments of women to the senior judiciary, the same can’t be said for BAME candidates and solicitors. “Barristers – not the most erse bunch – still dominate senior appointments. The concerns expressed in our report of last April remain alive including that there needs to be more shared accountability between the JAC and the judiciary to effect change.”Peter Herbert, the chair of the Society of Black Lawyers, said: “These statistics demonstrate that racial ersity in the judiciary is simply not happening fast enough. When a royal wedding ceremony demonstrates greater racial ersity than our justice system something is badly wrong. “We urge the minister of justice to adopt clear targets for the recruitment, retention and promotion of BME judges and magistrates. A judicial ‘Rooney rule’ should be adopted so that every BME candidate who fits the criteria must be interviewed. “These are some of the basic measures necessary that will help to ensure the judiciary and magistracy truly represents the erse society they serve.”Christina Blacklaws, the vice-president of the Law Society, which represents solicitors across England and Wales, said: “Without doubt the skills solicitors develop in practice are more and more relevant to the changing court environment.“Many solicitors demonstrate the expertise needed to be an effective judge: intellect, the ability to be fair and even-handed, authority, and advanced communications skills.“The solicitor profession has a vital part to play ensuring our world-renowned judiciary is as erse as the society it serves and I would encourage all solicitors to consider whether a judicial role might be right for them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95d92c1ddbdf48bfe24eac6a2cc4f7cbbc5b58f2/728_626_5925_3556/master/5925.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ad75418de2ab2192cf7363c9d38814f","title":"experience i am a one legged tap dancer","story":"The consultant vowed to save my life and come to my first performance as an amputeeIt was during a production in 2009 at university, where I was studying musical theatre, that I started to feel pain in my right leg.

My consultant explained that they would never have cut my leg off without trying everything else first. The bone cancer was potentially deadly, so this wasn’t just about the loss of a limb. He vowed to save my life and come to my first dance performance as an amputee.I went home for a week before the amputation. I drive a manual car, so I searched on YouTube and found a double amputee doing just that, with no modifications at all. Seeing what amputees could do got me really excited about becoming one.Then I remembered Clayton “Peg Leg” Bates – a tapping legend who’d lost his leg in a cotton mill accident when he was 12, and had danced on a peg leg made by his uncle. I’d grown up idolising him. He was totally badass. Before the operation, I posted a video of him dancing on the Ed Sullivan Show, and thought, “In one year, I’ll be doing this.”I was up and using my first prosthetic leg very quickly. I learned to walk and dress myself fashionably, which is very important to me. I taught myself to drive again, and went back to college.I soon found out the cancer had spread to my lungs. I had two operations to remove tumours and 16 months of chemotherapy. University kept me positive. I’d have chemo during the day, and then sing and act in the evening with a backpack of fluids.As soon as I finished my treatment in 2011, I said to my prosthetist that it was time to try a peg leg so I could dance. I’d been tapdancing at a high level for over a decade and I was missing it. I went to a rehearsal space alone, put it on and started creating rhythms. I treated it like an instrument, an extension of my body. My muscle memory kicked in I could still do things with my left foot, and then dropped in the peg leg for extra beats. I used videos to track my progress. My roommate said I should post them online – I did the first one at 4am, and by the time I woke up, it was everywhere.There is a different technique with a real foot you’ve got a heel and toe, and you can make different sounds and rhythms. When you have a peg, you just have one point. Now, I dance in a different way. People tell me my shoulders are hunched or my head is over to the side. Well, that’s because I’m dancing on one leg!In 2010, when I first became one, amputees were just about to break through into the mainstream. There’s been a shift since. Now, it’s, “Hey, I’m an amputee, loud and proud!” It’s important to show the world amputees who are happy and continuing with their lives, although I was self-conscious in the early days, especially when people would draw their kids away from me. I now volunteer in schools and hospitals, dancing and talking about my leg I do motivational speaking and teach dance classes as well as playing in my band. We’re called Evan Ruggiero and the S’Evan Legs – there are four of us, but only seven legs.I have nine prosthetics, and typically travel with four – two peg and two walking legs. The peg legs are made of alloy or titanium – a wooden one would probably break.Since losing my leg, I’ve worked on different musicals, celebrating the fact that I’m an amputee. In one show, my character was in bed with his girlfriend. The joke was that one of the bedposts was actually my leg, which I removed and started screwing into my residual limb in a very sensual way. I’m totally comfortable joking about it. I get the audience behind me by making them laugh.I didn’t choose any of this, but my career will probably be bigger and better because of my peg leg. I’ve danced at Paralympic events in London, and at the Oscars earlier this year. I’m now auditioning for principal Broadway roles, and was nominated for outstanding actor in a musical at the Drama Desk awards this year. Disabled actors have taken leading and ensemble parts on Broadway. Now, I want to see an amputee in one of those leading roles. Maybe it’ll be me..• As told to Camilla PalmerDo you have an experience to share?

The band’s most celebrated mode is the fast, literate indie-punk of their first LP which modulated into brawny desert blues and then on to soulful, swaggering stadium rock for their most successful album, 2013’s AM. But throughout, there’s been another style, where Alex Turner seems to don a suit and croon for the bingo-playing masses: you can hear it as he address the “scummy man” in When the Sun Goes Down, or in The Jeweller’s Hands at the end of Humbug, or his take on John Cooper Clarke’s I Wanna Be Yours from AM. And it’s this style that the band’s new album, Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino – performed live here for the first time in the UK – expands upon. Turner takes the twisted light-entertainer shtick of Scott Walker, or his fellow Sheffield expat Jarvis Cocker (Pulp’s This Is Hardcore sounds like a major touchstone) and uses it on supper-club songs that shimmer like the cheap chandelier fittings in your grandma’s house. Some might say this is a pose, that’s he’s insulating himself with quotation marks: an ironic crooner giving it some smirking razzle-dazzle. Maybe so, but just as he regards his peers with both fondness and disgust on A Certain Romance, Turner can happily hold two opposing thoughts – he might be taking the piss a bit, but when he lets his voice soar, he finds himself meaning it too. Both these sides and more are on show at this often masterful showcase of British rock’n’roll. Opening with Four Out of Five, a droll fantasy of a gentrified moon, Turner makes self-mocking simian shapes around the slow ‘okey cokey of the rhythm section. With his slicked-back hair he resembles the psychopathic Bob from Twin Peaks crossed with a minor Scarface goon, though later, when he tucks it behind his ear, he is briefly a prim 1950s secretary. Later he says “We’d like to play you now the title track of our new LP” like Dean Martin, with full-bore irony, and at one point introduces guitarist Jamie Cook like an R\u0026ampB star showing off his band. But they all can’t help but feel it. Knee Socks is almost cruel in its funky exactitude Cornerstone is brimming with restless romance One Point Perspective sees Turner makes priapic poses with one of his many beautiful guitars, but is genuinely sexy. The band, bolstered by supporting players on keys and acoustic guitar, are immaculately drilled – sometimes too much so, as on Pretty Visitors, which hops around with math-rock fussiness, or She Looks Like Fun, which looks tremendously enjoyable for Cook but will surely not hang around their setlist for long.  Much better is when their chops are transmuted into pure energy: Brianstorm, Don’t Sit Down ’Cause I’ve Moved Your Chair and View from the Afternoon swerve too fast through their corners and are all the better for it. The drummer Matt Helders, a mere timekeeper during the Tranquility Base material, is transformed into a dynamo with a spotlight behind him, he becomes a tub-thumping Godzilla on the rear wall.Wherever they turn, irony dissolves and Turner, acting out lyrics like “I lost my train of thought” or “she held me very tightly” with am-dram theatricality, can’t help but be a real rock star even as he plays with the role. In the end, every side to the band – funk troupe, garage punks, aloof posers, heartfelt songwriters – coheres on the closing R U Mine?, a diamond anthem that tightens and collapses at all the right moments. Now armed with what is essentially a greatest-hits set, Arctic Monkeys have become a band who can do everything – it might be a construct, but it feels so real."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f86690808e0b03c42f3418a7e8da04e644adceb/0_66_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5722a9ef922918e6766fe133767bf4a4","title":"lost 1963 john coltrane album discovered","story":"An album of previously unheard original compositions by the legendary jazz saxophonist has been discovered, 55 years after its recordingA lost album of originals by John Coltrane, the American saxophonist who took jazz to new heights of freedom and expression, has been unearthed.The album, being released on 29 June as Both Directions at Once: the Lost Album, was recorded in a session on 6 March 1963, at the Van Gelder studios in New Jersey. Joining Coltrane in the quartet that also recorded classic albums such as A Love Supreme, Coltrane, and Ballads, are Jimmy Garrison on double bass, Elvin Jones on drums, and McCoy Tyner on piano. The master tape left in the studio was lost, and it’s likely it was destroyed in the early 70s when the label, Impulse!, was trying to reduce storage fees. But Coltrane gave his own reference tape of the recording to his wife Naima, despite their then disintegrating relationship – the pair orced in 1966, and the tape has stayed in her family’s possession ever since.Sonny Rollins, a peer of Coltrane’s and also regarded as one of the greatest jazz saxophonists of all time, described the discovery as “like finding a new room in the Great Pyramid”.Among the seven tracks are two completely unheard original compositions, called Untitled Original 11383 and Untitled Original 11386, both of which are played on soprano saxophone. Another composition, One Up, One Down, has been heard only in a live bootleg from the Birdland jazz club, and never before in this studio version.The sessions capture Coltrane at a crucial juncture in his music. It was still two years before Ascension, where he opened up his quartet into an experimental, spiritually minded big band, but he was already heading towards its “free jazz” sound. Impressions (1963), recorded across the previous two years, features some unmoored and raw soloing quite different from the previous bebop era. Nevertheless, he was still in love with melody: Ballads, recorded during the same period and also released in 1963, features some of his most accessible material. The 11386 recording similarly sees the quartet play in a traditional style, revisiting a melodic chorus theme between solos, and the album also features Coltrane’s first, never before heard version of Nat King Cole’s Nature Boy – unlike the freer 1965 version, the Both Directions at Once version is a straight three-minute take without solos. Ben Ratliff, former New York Times jazz writer and author of Coltrane: the Story of a Sound, told the : “This is Coltrane’s quartet starting to move into the last stages of their stable and authoritative phase, when they were often playing the same handful of songs. There’s no concept or grand design here. But he’s trying some new tunes, and playing a strange blues, and fine-tuning Impressions – and that’s a lot.”Both Directions at Once was recorded at an intensely fertile time for Coltrane and his quartet – as well as Ballads and Impressions, he also released a collaboration with Duke Ellington in 1963. The lost session was recorded during a two-week run of shows at Birdland – Coltrane played the club straight after the session – and the following day, 7 March, he recorded the album John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman with the jazz singer (its tracklisting changed on the way to the studio, after the pair heard Nat King Cole singing Lush Life on the radio and decided to include their own version).Saxophonist Wayne Shorter, interviewed for the album’s liner notes, says the title Both Directions at Once came from a compositional tip Coltrane gave to him: “about starting a sentence in the middle, and then going to the beginning and the end of it at the same time.” ’s jazz critic John Fordham finds another meaning: “Coltrane was looking back at bebop – the virtuosity and melodic resources of which he had stretched to breaking point – and the song-based lyricism of jazz he had recently explored with Duke Ellington, and was about to with Johnny Hartman. But he was also looking forward to imagining the more intense, mantra-like, spiritually-driven music that produced A Love Supreme in 1964.”British jazz and improv saxophonist Evan Parker meanwhile told the : “This release is most welcome – the ‘classic quartet’ was where Coltrane did his best work.” He picked out Coltrane’s interplay with drummer Elvin Jones as being “the core of the music ... which reached astonishing levels of intuitive understanding.”Ratliff adds that “most of all, Both Directions at Once is a study in how seriously strong the band was, and how powerful his intent, or his concentration, had become.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/843ae6dcd8ba6993b9776e7085b0d3cc13982943/130_0_3900_2340/master/3900.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36f27eef00fb53451677cae21d4fecde","title":"gypsy damian le bras road traveller roots","story":"It is Friday night. I’m 30 years old, alone on a fake-fur blanket in the back of a cold Transit van. Most of my generation are out there in pubs, or indoors by the telly, canoodling, arguing or cooking, or going across to the thermostat to turn the heating up. I’m parked on a Cornish industrial estate with no warmth except the tiny, wavering plume of heat that rises out of my lantern. This place is so lonesome that even the doggers, boy-racers and stoners have spurned it. I curse myself silently. You’re not a Traveller, my mate, you’re a . What sort of Traveller would come and sleep here on their own? I have covered thousands of miles in my van in a bid to uncover the history of Gypsy Britain. But the road is proving tough.Gypsy reality is partly composed of fairgrounds and showgrounds, picturesque lakeside halts, sheltered commons, bright heaths. But it also comprised frozen copses and hilltops. Old maintenance roads with potholes and bad light. Scrapyards. Council waste ground. Lay-bys near the edges of tips. Slag-heaps and drained marshes. Fen ends. Chalk pits, yards and quarries. These are the stopping places, these fringes and in-between places. They are the places that nobody lives except Travellers – or nobody but those who share ancient connections with them: gamekeepers and poachers, scrap-metal men, horsewomen, rangers and shepherds. They are the old nomads’ haunts of the island. Many are smashed and built over some – magically – are still more or less just as they were in centuries long past. They form the hidden Gypsy and Traveller map of the country we live in: they are the bedrock of our reality and, perhaps, the antidote to the unending cycles of romanticisation and demonisation.I had conceived a plan to visit these places, to live in them in my own way, and see what I might learn. Perhaps I might even solve the bizarre contradiction of Britain’s love affair with caravanning, camping and glamping, and its hatred of those who were born to this life, and who largely inspired its adoption as a non-Gypsy pastime. As one Scottish Gypsy Traveller put it: “There are 80,000 members of the Caravan Club, but I’m not allowed to travel?”There is more to this Gypsy geography than a list of physical places. The stopping places themselves are an outgrowth of something non-physical, something that is ancient, unseen yet important, precious and reviled, envied and feared. This thing is the Gypsy belief – the core belief of the culture – that it is possible to live in a different way: in your own way, part of the world, but not imprisoned by the rules. That you can know the ropes and yet not be hemmed in by them. That you can dwell alongside the mainstream, while not being part of it. Otter-like, you can live in the bank of the river and swim and hunt there when you need to, and then climb back out with equal ease and alacrity. There is no better symbol of this belief than the network of atchin tans (stopping places) laced across Britain they are historical, topographical proof that the Gypsy philosophy has existed here, that it still does, that it still can. By staying at the traditional stopping places, I hoped to answer the questions that had been following me, on and off, all my life. What is left of these places? What might we learn from them? What redemption might lie there, in a country that still passes new legislation aimed at ending the Traveller way of life? Is it still possible to live on the road? Was the end of the old Gypsy life a tragedy, or was it a case of good riddance to an irredeemably hard and pitiless life on the edge? Above all, I hoped to resolve the biggest question: the question of myself, whether I could make my peace with Gypsy culture. My conflict seemed to echo the wider tension between nomads and settled people that endures in modern Britain.On the way to our regular pitch selling flowers in the marketplace in Petersfield, my elders would point and nod at empty spaces by the sides of the road, flat areas on verges and slightly raised banks, vacant pull-ins and lay-bys, and make comments as if there was something there, something I couldn’t see. They were glimmers of another world, but it felt as distant as the stars. I knew the places had something to do with the time they were “on the road” – most of my family were settled now, living in houses or caravans and mobile homes on private bits of land.Travellers I knew from the east of England had lived rough deep into the recent past, still working the farms into the 1990s. By then, it had been the best part of 50 years since anyone in my family had depended on that kind of work. So it came as a shock to meet Travellers younger than me who had grown up picking turnips in January. They described reaching down with a gloved hand and grabbing hold of the big, leafy tops, how it would sometimes send a plug of ice shooting upwards.Alongside selling flowers, my family had roofing and car-breaking businesses. We had a big field and a yard, a word that seemed to mean a place where all things might, and did, happen. Terriers, geese and perturbed-looking cockerels roamed in between the legs of cantankerous horses. Stables were stacked full of the musty paraphernalia of horsemanship, flower-selling, roofing and car respraying. Bits of cars lay everywhere, named as if they were the parts or clothes of people or animals: bonnets, boots, seats, wings, belts. There were brass-handled horsewhips, jangling harnesses, buckets of molasses-sprayed chaff and milled sugar-beet, bales of sweet-smelling fresh hay. But all of this old rustic stuff was stacked and wedged in among the hard and greasy gear of the family economy: gas bottles, blowtorches, leaky old engines, spray paint, rolls of lead, felt, and seemingly infinite stacks of every conceivable type of roof tile. A heavy boxing bag swung with barely perceptible creaks, keeping time in the half-light of the dusty old garage.There were caravans there that we sometimes lived in and out of, especially in the summer. We never considered this odd, even though we also had a big house on the land that my grandad had built with his men. And there always seemed to be heavy and dangerous things lying close to hand. The hard stuff of motion was everywhere, although we were settled: cars, tractors and trucks, some brand-new, others eaten by weather and time horses, ponies, traps, sulkies and carts scattered wheels and bolts from Ford and Bedford lorries. And, hung from a barn door like a pair of swords and scabbing to ochre with rust, there were two axles rescued from the ashes of the last wagon owned by our family.We had a name for ourselves: Travellers. In our case, it didn’t just mean anyone who travelled around, regardless of their race: to us it meant our people specifically, the Romanies of Britain. The first Romanies probably arrived on the British mainland towards the end of the 15th century, and had been a contentious presence ever since.Wherever the Gypsies went, they took with them their strange tongue, Romani, and it was through this that the mystery of their origins was solved. An 18th-century German linguist called Johann Rüdiger overheard Gypsies talking, and was struck by the similarity of their speech to Indian languages. Later linguists, including the so-called “Romany Ryes” – rye being the Romani word for a gentleman – such as the English writer George Borrow and the Irish academic John Sampson, would identify layers of borrowings from Persian, Slavic and Romance languages in the Gypsies’ speech, using these to trace a philological map of their long road into the West. English Romani had German-derived words in it, like nixis, meaning “nothing”, and fogel for “smell”.As for the name of the Romanies, it was derived from their own word for “man” or “husband”, rom, and it had nothing to do with Romania, which got its name from the Roman military camps which once filled its territory. The Gypsies called their language Romanes, an adverb meaning “like a rom”. To rokker Romanes meant, simply, to talk like a Gypsy and not like a gorjer – a non-Gypsy. The word gorjies comes from the old Romany word gadje or gadzhe, and though its form has mutated with time, its meaning is the same: the non-Gypsies, outsiders, the people-who-aren’t-us.Almost everyone who has studied Romani in Britain has remarked on how adept its speakers are at coming up with names for things. In some ways, talking Romanes means having to be constantly inventive and alert, both in terms of creating words and also interpreting the new ones that get spun off the cuff and thrown into daily Traveller conversation. There is no stigma attached to inventing words, as there so often is in English nor are new words looked down upon as annoying neologisms that we’d be better off without. Invented words are more likely to be smiled upon or chuckled at as evidence of a witty, intelligent mind one with a good and flexible grasp of the ancient Travellers’ tongue.Besides, if Romani is to retain one of the functions which has kept it alive thus far – and which it has in common with almost all minority languages – namely, to stop outsiders knowing what you are talking about, then it will always be necessary to invent new ways of saying things. According to a Belarusian Romany man I once met, a word is no longer a truly Romani word once its meaning becomes known amongst the gadzhe – it is useless, dead, and best left where it is. This is an extreme opinion, but it points to a common anxiety: that the language will lose its power if it becomes too widely known. Yet words come and go as they please, like mood and temper traded by friends, explained by lovers, and hurled across the fray. Every Gypsy who “gives away” the Romani language risks the accusation of treason.In the old Romany tradition, you can only call yourself a true Romany Gypsy – one of the kaulo ratti, the black blood – if all your ancestors, as far as you know, are of the tribe. I can trace my Romany ancestry back at least six generations I was brought up to know the Romani language to learn the old tales and to keep the Romanipen – the cleanliness taboos of the old-fashioned Gypsies. I was raised, and still live, in a Romany psychological realm a mental Gypsyland.I have both Gypsy and non-Gypsy blood and so, in many Travellers’ eyes, I do not have the right to call myself a true-bred Romany. It does not matter that there is no such thing as a racially pure Gypsy: over a 1,000-year migration it is virtually impossible that there will have been no mingling in the line. The mixing in my family had happened within living memory, and this meant I was at best a poshrat – a mixed-blood Gypsy – and at worst a “half-chat gorjie” or, as a friend once memorably put it, a “fucked-up half-breed”.I do not look like most people’s idea of a typical Gypsy, my blue eyes and fair hair belying my origins, my picture of myself. My identity was inside me and the outside didn’t match up. It imbued me with a tetchy defensiveness, and a resentment of people whom I then believed had simpler ethnicities: Scottish, Nigerian, Han.I felt so close to my roots, and especially to the Romany women who had brought me up – my mum her mother, Gran and Gran’s mother, Nan. But this seemed to count for little in a world which, for all its modernity, still believed in labels such as “half-caste”, “full-blood” and “mixed race”. Later, as a teenager, I started carrying photographs of darker-haired family members in my wallet, to challenge the disbelief of those who thought I was lying about my Romany background. I lived in a world that wasn’t sure if I really belonged in it, and so I wasn’t sure, either. Regardless, it was where I was. Our family were the mistrusted local Gypsies, the bane of the decent, upstanding parish council. We were “gyppos”, “pikeys”, “diddakois”, “them lot”. Locally, we were infamous. The ide was crystal clear.Compared with the insults and slurs, the words Romanies, Gypsies, and Travellers were dignified, and we used all of them interchangeably. The greater part of our family owned their own yards and bungalows, but the name Travellers still seemed to make sense. There were wheels everywhere, and we were always on hair-trigger alert to hook up trailers and go when the need arose: we drove miles for a living, and had family who lived on the road. Some places with links to the Travellers were not easily romanticised. The sides of the M1, the A1, the A303 and the M25 are peppered with modern-day atchin tans. They are sites with access to opportunities to earn money, and – being less desirable to non-Gypsies – also the sorts of locales where less cash is needed to set up a camp.Such places symbolise the misunderstood truth of many Traveller lives, which is that they are neither permanently nomadic, nor ever truly static. Howbeit, these yards provide a base, the highway is right beside them, ready for the times when family ties, work, a wedding, a funeral, the fair season, beckon. Councils refer to them as “sites close to the key regional transport corridors, favoured by Gypsies and Travellers”. Travellers call them :“Handy, being right by that main road”. Handy, yes, but still handcuffed to tragedy. Every family is haunted by stories of relatives, too often toddlers, who have been knocked down and killed by their literal closeness to roads.The word “Gypsy” wasn’t often heard back when I was a teenager. When it was, it was usually as part of a story about the old days, where someone had shouted out, “Dirty Gypsies!” and nine times out of 10 a fight had ensued, which the dirty Gypsies – who, in my grandad’s words, were “rough, tough and made out of the right stuff” – almost always won.In our world, arguments are often resolved by somebody leaving and the relationship being severed. If this doesn’t happen, then there will almost always be a fight. In the best-case scenario, it’ll just be a fair fist fight, nice and clean, one-on-one, with a referee to see fair play and as few spectators as possible to get sucked into the row. It can be between two men or two women: it’s usually men, but not always. These things are often organised quickly in a place right out of the way, so the law is unlikely to be an issue plus, some police officers I’ve spoken to even seem to have a laissez-faire stance on it, possibly because they have seen worse ways of ending a row than a bare-knuckle fight. Worst-case scenario, it will not be clean and it will not be fair, and the more people that get involved, the more likely that is. If weapons come into it, then the police are especially likely to show an interest.The proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674-1913 are speckled with references to London’s Gypsies and Travellers. There is a website that explains why they were “over-represented in the proceedings”: they formed part of “what many contemporaries considered a dangerous and crime-prone “residuum”’, which seeped back into the city at autumn following the end of the temporary farm work. It goes on, telling how “in a working-class mirror to the elite’s “London Season”, October and November saw hundreds and thousands of men, women and children returning to the capital from hop-picking and market gardening, from touring the fairs and tramping in search of work”. It was a yearly migration from the city to the countryside and back that continued, for some, right up to the 1950s.For all its flighty connotations, Gypsy culture can be stifling in its demands for living in line with its hidden rules. Rock stars employ “Gypsy” to mean those who have escaped from moral claustrophobia, but in reality, Gypsies are just as likely to feel confined as anybody else. In Glasgow, I watched as a troupe of little girls from the local Roma community danced in brightly coloured dresses at a community event. They clicked their fingers on outstretched arms and sang “Ja tuke tuke” to a furious klezmer beat. The audience clapped and twirled, unaware of the lyrics’ meaning: “Get away from me.”Nan talks of the old paradox that we have heard about all of our lives. The hardship of old times, versus the sense of togetherness that Travellers have lost. The gratitude for comforts that not long ago were undreamed of and unheard of, set against the moral corruption, unhappiness and constant malaise that have come from an overfast integration into the gorjies’ consumerist world.For centuries, politicians had guessed that if Gypsies could be settled in regular housing, then within a few short generations they would be just like everyone else. There would be no need for a word for outsiders, because we would be just like them. But that isn’t what has happened. Many Gypsies now live either in housing, or on permanent caravan sites, not in meadows or lanes or lay-bys or by the sides of old tips. And yet they are still what they are, changed in some ways, but different enough to draw the old line between themselves and the gorjies.I sometimes wonder what Nan thinks I am. Of course, I am her great-grandson, born from her line, flesh and blood. But I’m not what she calls a “true Traveller”. Aside from my mixed roots, I wasn’t born to that life: I arrived into a changed era, one of stability, stasis, hot running water, and Christmases stacked with teetering piles of presents. The Romany bloodline never dies out. But the life of the Traveller changes, sometimes so much so that you could forgive the outside world for thinking the people themselves have vanished.When I was small, Horsmonden in Kent was a typical Travellers’ horse fair. This meant that most people weren’t actually there for the horses. It’s true that a core of those who came, mostly men but quite a few women as well, were proper horse people. They came towing their boxes with strong cobs standing inside, tethered in the half-light their two-wheeled sulkies – light trotting carts with a seat big enough for one or two people – and their harness, head collars and whips. But people came from far and near to the fair, and most of them weren’t interested in any equine displays. If they were, then it was simply because they provided an authentic backdrop. What they were interested in depended on the inidual: but mostly, they were interested in each other. It is a quirk of our scatteredness: a few hundred thousand people at most, flecked across Britain’s damp islands, and we meet mostly at weddings, funerals and fairs. The horse trade has its ups and downs – as I write this, it’s down, the worst in my lifetime. But the horse fairs will persist, because their purpose goes beyond trade.When the days are hot and tanned skins gleam with sweat in the sun, it is clear once again that horse fairs are shop windows for young brides and husbands. They always have been. This much, at least, is gospel, and proudly announced to journalists and inquisitive souls who come asking questions about the culture. But not every dalliance ends in a marriage, and rumours occasionally flare of unauthorised, ultra-brief flings at the fringes of fairs: dangerous liaisons that lead to bad names, fights, or worse, feuds that run on and on.For the not so young, what they seek from each other is something subtler, less clear to outsiders, but an equally powerful draw. I suspect few would want to explain what it was, for fear of sapping its power by giving it voice. What the fairs offer is a chance to track the progress of our lives: to reminisce about previous years when we trod the same field, but equally to remark on how far we have come.We polish and dress up our lives for the day and compare them to the lives of others, affirming their context, confirming their meaning. The fairs are where we remind ourselves who we are. It’s not that we don’t keep being who we are in between – of course we do. But the fairs provide a special concentration of Traveller experience, a tincture of what it is to be a Gypsy. At a horse fair we get to see, just for one day, what life would be like if the world shared our Gypsy priorities.And then there are those who despise both horses and the fairs. For some families, the horse had its day a long time ago. I once asked my mate Charles if he and his family used to go to the fairs up north, which is where he comes from. He looked at me as though the question was perverse. “We don’t mind a day at the races, but Damian, can you see me or me dad, or any of us here, fucking about with horses? My great-great-grandad was a proper Gypsy man, and he was driving a Rolls-Royce a hundred year ago.”Traveller culture, preoccupied though it can be with bygone times, has always preferred the tangible: today’s bread, the here and the now. As Nan says, “You can only eat one meal at a time.” In the past, writers took this as evidence that Gypsies inhabited a “heroic present”, lacking a sense of history and living so sharply in the moment that concepts such as deferred gratification were lost on them. I have always dismissed such ideas as inherently dangerous: they are liable to slide into essentialism, and the belief that races have irreconcilable differences. But maybe in turning so sharply away from a lie, I lost sight of a truth: that the present holds a finer promise than the past with its shadows and dust. In an inversion of the obvious, perhaps even the Traveller obsession with cemetery maintenance itself supports this view. After all, isn’t the act of placing flowers on a tomb a gesture of bringing a little life back to the dead?After the fair at Horsmonden, I largely avoided gatherings of people, spending time in empty stopping places, visiting forlorn churches and well-kept graves. It is dawning on me that there is only so much I can learn from this. Another of Nan’s catchphrases comes to me: “There are no pockets in shrouds.” Perhaps this saying, a caution against overzealous pursuit of riches, masks a second meaning as well. There is a poverty to death a limit to how much a skeleton can teach you about a life it no longer knows.I realised how sparsely furnished my van was. Its naked pale blue surfaces stared at me like sheets of ice. For eight months, I had been travelling with what I thought were the bare essentials – bed, stove, wash gear, clothes and so forth. But there were other trappings of Romany life, when it was lived most richly: beautiful furnishings, gilded surfaces, portable pictures, talismans and silks. I’ve been missing a trick: the means by which a difficult life was rendered livable and even, at times, enviable.When I asked Mum for help, she looked happy, as if pleased that I’d finally grasped the meaning of life. She gave me armfuls of folded materials. There was an Islamic purple velvet hanging, edged with golden stitching and arranged in a pattern of teardrops matching Bedouin horse-cloths, constructed out of navy blue and orange-coloured diamond shapes of fabric brightly coloured Indian tapestry cloths: two square ones, and one in the shape of an arch. They shouted in bright yellows and blues and greens and pinks, with tiny mirrors stitched into them alongside little embroidered birds, stars, flowers, chakra wheels and Hindu swastikas. I decorated the van, clipping the cloths to the plywood lining with bulldog clips and larger, stronger, rubber-tipped market grips.The van was completely transformed. Its contents came together into a nomadic aesthetic all of its own ramshackle, yet somehow making happy sense as a whole. My gran and grandad – Mum’s parents – wandered over to see what I’d been doing. They seemed stunned, but in a good way: “Looks like an old vardo,” Grandad said, using the Traveller word for caravan. Gran remarked that the way I had hung the cloths reminded her of the inside of the Travellers’ square tents back when she was a little girl. Their approval came as a relief. I slammed the doors and smiled as I thought of the road ahead.• Follow the long read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.This is an edited extract from The Stopping Places by Damian Le Bas, published by Chatto \u0026amp Windus on 7 June.

It will spend £500,000 on billboards and newspaper advertising in areas such as Stoke, Carlisle, and towns and cities in the east Midlands.The manifesto expresses the hope that any second referendum campaign would be subject to “stringent policing” and conducted in a different tone to the last, saying both sides should respect voters rather than adopt messages ranging from Project Fear to “false claims” that the NHS would be able to spend £350m a week extra once the UK had left."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/402d46303758f61d38d8f27f07612fc3666b60cc/1566_2167_9431_5658/master/9431.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8729e75f9b051e449b78ac48c0303e8c","title":"nasa mars rover finds organic matter in ancient lake bed","story":"Curiosity digs up carbon compounds that could be food for life in sediments that formed 3bn years agoNasa’s veteran Curiosity rover has found complex organic matter buried and preserved in ancient sediments that formed a vast lake bed on Mars more than 3bn years ago.The discovery is the most compelling evidence yet that long before the planet became the parched world it is today, Martian lakes were a rich soup of carbon-based compounds that are necessary for life, at least as we know it.Researchers cannot tell how the organic material formed and so leave open the crucial question: are the compounds remnants of past organisms the product of chemical reactions with rocks or were they brought to Mars in comets or other falling debris that slammed into the surface? All look the same in the tests performed.But whatever the ultimate source of the material, if microbial life did find a foothold on Mars, the presence of organics meant it would not have gone hungry. “We know that on Earth microorganisms eat all sorts of organics. It’s a valuable food source for them,” said Jennifer Eigenbrode, a biogeochemist at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.“While we don’t know the source of the material, the amazing consistency of the results makes me think we have a slam-dunk signal for organics on Mars,” Eigenbrode added. “It is not telling us that life was there, but it is saying that everything organisms really needed to live in that kind of environment, all of that was there.”The car-sized rover, which has trundled a careful 12 miles (19.3km) since it landed in the planet’s Gale crater nearly six years ago, detected a slew of organic molecules in pieces of Martian mudstone it drilled from the ancient lake bed and heated in its onboard oven. When the samples reached 500 to 820C, the rover’s instruments detected a range of so-called aromatic, aliphatic and thiophenic vapours. The science team believes these are breakdown products of even larger organic molecules, similar to those found in coal, which were trapped in the Martian rocks in the distant past.“To me it is amazing that we can show we have organic matter preserved for more than 3bn years in these rocks,” said Kirsten Siebach, a planetary geologist who was not involved in the work at Rice University in Houston, Texas. “This is very promising for the preservation of potential ancient life on the planet.”“These molecules could have been part of life, but they could also have been food for life,” Siebach added. “To know that the water really was full of organic molecules really opens up the different ways that life could have existed on Mars.”The Nasa rover has found hints of organics on the planet before. In 2015, mission scientists reported that Curiosity had detected whiffs of chlorine-containing organics in the planet’s rocks, but concerns over potential contamination and instrument glitches meant that the results did not convince everyone.The latest findings, reported in the journal Science, are far more compelling. According to Inge Loes ten Kate, a geologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, “the results convincingly show the long-awaited detection of organic compounds on Mars.”The discovery of organics in rocks mere centimetres beneath the Martian surface has raised hopes of finding richer deposits of the compounds deeper down. In those may lurk tell-tale signs of life itself, scientists say. “If we can find things like fatty acids, that would be the first potential hints of life,” said Eigenbrode.In a separate paper published in Science, another Nasa-led team describes Curiosity’s latest measurements of the Martian atmosphere. Before the rover touched down in August 2012, missions to the red planet had already spotted methane in the atmosphere which spiked from time to time as plumes of the gas apparently rose from the planet. The discovery fuelled speculation that the gas might be the expulsions of Martian microbes eking out an existence deep underground. More mundane explanations included chemical reactions between water and Martian rocks.The new measurements do not settle the question, but the team led by Christopher Webster at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion lab in California reveals the first regular pattern in Mars’s fluctuating methane. Tests on the Martian air show that background levels of methane rise and fall with the changing seasons. As winter gives way to summer in the northern hemisphere, the methane triples from 0.24 to 0.65 parts per billion.Webster suspects that reservoirs of methane lie deep under the surface of Mars, perhaps in water crystals called clathrates, and leak the gas continuously. When the methane reaches the surface, it sticks to Martian dust but is released in ever-increasing quantities when the ground warms up in the summer.“These subsurface reservoirs could be from ancient methane that was trapped underground, or from methane that is forming today. Either way it could be produced by chemistry or by microbial activity. We certainly cannot rule out a biological source at this stage,” said Webster.Taking the measurements was no easy task. A year on Mars lasts two Earth years, so to spot a seasonal pattern in the methane levels, the scientists had to take readings for four Earth years. “That’s why it has taken us so long,” said Webster. “Talk about having patience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ec04cddf583f6140ced036e34c71c1692e93c28/0_76_3338_2003/master/3338.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c94e9c81c955aa6c828a1df293a7822d","title":"the upside of chronic anxiety being good in emergencies","story":"‘In dramatic situations, I’ve felt like a regulation hero, but really I’m just a highly anxious person who thrives in a crisis’ “I can’t feel anything!” the woman wailed. A taxi driver making a left turn on a snowy Thursday night had plowed into her, and then, realizing what he’d done, reversed, running over her legs a second time. “Is it my knees?” she asked as I crouched beside her. “I just got a double knee replacement. Please don’t say it’s my knees.” I told her I wasn’t sure, but the alignment of the taxi’s tires suggested they’d been crushed. I asked her name and told her mine, held her hand and draped my coat over her upper body. I learned she lived just a block away with her husband, but he wasn’t answering the phone. So I sprinted, slipped past the doorman and, when he opened their apartment door, said, “Everything is OK, but your wife was hit by a taxi. Grab your coat and come with me.” We made it back just in time he clambered into the ambulance behind her.I felt like a regulation hero, but really I’m just a highly anxious person who thrives in a crisis. Years ago, I got a diagnosis (generalized anxiety disorder) and some affirmation of how bad it is. (Doctor: “I’m impressed by how highly functioning you are, considering.”) For a long time, I didn’t think dealing with chronic anxiety and being good in emergencies were linked. It actually seems like the opposite would be true. But then, in 2016, I read the essay collection So Sad Today and came across a quote that forced me out of bed to get a pen. “For someone with anxiety, dramatic situations are, in a way, more comfortable than the mundane,” Melissa Broder wrote. “In dramatic situations, the world rises to meet your anxiety.” I underlined the passage, added a star in the margin and dog-eared the page for good measure.A few years before, dealing with a particularly severe bout of anxiety, I had tried cognitive behavioral therapy. It’s less “tell me your first memory of your parents abandoning you” and more “let’s see if we can figure out how your thought patterns are distorted by anxiety”. There were worksheets and homework assignments, new terms to learn and lists to make. Where previously I’d endlessly and obsessively worried about the smallest tests, that summer, I considered CBT the most important test of all. So while I started to recognize how persuasive and pervasive my anxiety is, I also happened to be dealing with said anxiety exactly the way I was used to – by treating it as a means to an end. Unsurprisingly, using anxiety to fuel my treatment of anxiety just resulted in more anxiety.Wisely, my therapist suggested I see a psychiatrist to explore pharmaceutical options. She offered a simile about drowning and said an anti-anxiety drug might help me get my head above water so I could start swimming to shore, AKA making real progress in and outside of her office. It was a compelling visual, but the idea of taking an anti-anxiety medication did not inspire confidence or anything resembling calm. I wasn’t so much worried that the drugs wouldn’t work – I was worried that they would. What if I get this taste of a different life, but then the drugs stop working and for the rest of my life I know how great things could but will never be again? I fretted.But also, to be honest, I was afraid that the drugs would work indefinitely and my anxiety would evaporate. It felt weird to be clinging to a part of me that also drove me to misery on a daily basis. Finally, my therapist asked: “What would happen if you were no longer this anxious?” I hemmed and hawed and then admitted that I saw my anxiety as fuel without it, I might not be as driven. “But what if your anxiety is hurting you, not helping?” she countered. “What if you’re successful in spite of your anxiety, not because of it?” It struck me as a completely absurd idea. “Well, I’d certainly have a lot of free time to think about other things,” I conceded. Riding the subway home, it occurred to me that just as often as it propelled me, anxiety rendered me completely immobile.Soon after, I decided to try taking something for anxiety. A psychiatrist recommended a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which is a type of antidepressant that’s commonly used in the treatment of anxiety disorders. It helped, a lot, especially initially and in combination with therapy. After the SSRI began to work, I thought I might be able to outrun my disorder, that I would someday graduate to being a person who has anxiety sometimes rather than a constantly anxious person.That doesn’t seem to be the case. The SSRI helps me deal with – but doesn’t cure – my anxiety. Sometimes, as I shake one of the tiny white pills out of its orange plastic container, it feels like a lifeline. Other days, I’m not even sure it’s doing much of anything, given how anxious I still am. Honestly, it’s hard to tell, as there are so many factors that influence my anxiety levels, from work to what’s going on in the world to whether I’m doing all the boring #selfcare things that actually help, like going to the dreaded gym.Talking about today’s highly anxiety-inducing climate in a recent set, comedian Aparna Nancherla said: “It’s weird that anxiety is finally on message. Like, if you’re an anxious person, it’s kind of like, ‘Well, this is what we trained for. This is our Olympics.’” As a gold-medal neurotic, I’d definitely qualify, but I don’t think I do much better than most people in dealing with the free-floating the-world-is-probably-ending-any-day-now angst. I mean, I’m still worrying over a History channel special from five years ago about a rogue comet that could wipe out the globe’s electricity, plunging us into a food crisis. And I only watched the commercial.But when it comes to a sudden emergency, I snap to. For fear of sounding like I’m bragging, I’ll just say that I’ve helped a nice number of strangers in awful circumstances. My anxiety is always there, humming in the background, sometimes so present I can’t listen to anything else. It’s a deadweight, one I sometimes wish I could chuck in the Hudson river. But carrying something like that around doesn’t only give you a neck ache, it also gives you a particular type of strength. I think that’s why I knew to crouch down next to the old lady under the taxi, to direct other bystanders to step back and give her space, to speak clearly and kindly. Even if I haven’t been pinned under a 4,000lb taxi, I know the feeling of something pressing down on you like it’ll never let up.Lenny Letter is a newsletter offering unfiltered writing on feminism, style, health, politics and friendship.

Since triumphing in Sydney in 1979 they had won only two of the following 20 Tests against the Wallabies as the southern hemisphere established a gap over the north, closed briefly by England in the early 2000s.Now Ireland are second in the world rankings and, according to the Australia head coach, Michael Cheika, favourites to win in Brisbane on Saturday in the first of three Tests in Australia. The Wallabies have wobbled since reaching the 2015 World Cup final and on their last outing conceded 50 points to Scotland.“This is the best team Ireland have had in their rugby history,” said Cheika, although his opposite number, Joe Schmidt, is not fielding his strongest side on Saturday with Joey Carbery starting at 10 ahead of Johnny Sexton and a new front row assembled. “They are the No\u0026nbsp2 in the world and, while they can claim to be the underdogs as much as they like, they are going to be the favourites coming off the back of the season they have had.”Cheika was surprised Sexton was not starting – “He would almost rip my head off every time I told him he was not playing” – but with the World Cup 15 months away Schmidt needs to assess Carbery, whose move from Leinster to Munster next season will enable him to step out of Sexton’s shadow.“One of the challenges we have set for Joey is that he has to boss it,” Schmidt said. “He will be the pivotal link for most of what we do and having Bundee Aki and Robbie Henshaw outside him will free him up to act rather than think all the time.”While Ireland have made six changes from the side that defeated England in March to win the Six Nations grand slam, Australia have eight survivors from Murrayfield. They have two new caps at forward, the No\u0026nbsp8 Caleb Timu and Brandon Paenga-Amosa, the New Zealand-born hooker who a year ago was playing club rugby in Sydney and emptying bins for a living.On their bench is the uncapped Pete Samu who, like England’s Brad Shields, was only released by New Zealand after an arm-wrestle. “There is no way we will be underestimating Ireland this time,” said the scrum-half Will Genia, a survivor from 2011. “We know all about them now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b688afa289d724a5e1f0f89ce2243cc173a48061/0_161_3400_2039/master/3400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8039234d08a85be096b59ca50fcbfc9f","title":"french open 2018 semi final marco cecchinato dominic thiem rafael nadal juan martin del potro","story":"Second set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 6-5 Thiem (*denotes server): We reach the point where Cecchinato was broken in set one but lightning doesn’t strike twice. He holds comfortably and has earned a tie-break at the very least.Second set: Cecchinato 5-7, 5-5 Thiem* (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the set, Thiem scoots into a 40-0 lead. Cecchinato chops a sliced return at him to make it 40-15 but that’s as close as it gets.Second set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 5-4 Thiem (*denotes server): The game goes to 30-all. A grinding rally ensues. Thiem’s the first to blink, spraying a forehand wide when it might have been more prudent to keep testing Cecchinato’s focus. The game goes to deuce but Cecchinato has the resolve to dig deep and hold.Second set: Cecchinato 5-7, 4-4 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem treats Cecchinato to a taste of his own medicine, drop-shotting for 15-0. Thiem’s feeling the heat a little, though, and a missed backhand makes it 30-all. Just as well he volleys well, though, and it’s game when Thiem swings an ace down the middle.Second set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 4-3 Thiem (*denotes server): Cecchinato crunches into a 40-15 lead. Thiem knocks a forehand return long. This is turning into a very tight set. There’s tension but little drama. But you feel it’s warming up nicely.Second set: Cecchinato 5-7, 3-3 Thiem* (*denotes server): Cecchinato still can’t make any impression on Thiem’s serve. On we trundle.Second set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 3-2 Thiem (*denotes server): Thiem has a sniff at 15-30 and a pungent drop shot from Cecchinato allows the Austrian to claim two break points. Cecchinato wipes them both out, though, volleying and then serving well. The game goes to deuce and again Cecchinato clambers to safety.Second set: Cecchinato 5-7, 2-2 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem’s finding it a breeze on serve. As long as that remains the case, it’s hard to see him losing.Second set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 2-1 Thiem (*denotes server): Cecchinato’s refusing to let losing the first set affect him. He holds to 15.Second set: Cecchinato 5-7, 1-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem races into a 40-0 lead. No fuss: he holds to 15.Second set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 1-0 Thiem (*denotes server): Cecchinato tries one drop shot too many at 30-all and Thiem forces him to spurt a backhand wide. Break point. The Italian thinks about changing his racket. Instead he hangs on a bit and produces a sublime, feathery drop shot to make it deuce. Then he changes his racket. The Italian turns up the power and holds.A fine piece of serve-volleying makes it 40-15 to Thiem. Two set points. A big serve on the first is enough to end the argument. Thiem pumps his fist. This is his to lose.First set: Cecchinato* 5-6 Thiem (*denotes server): The game goes to 30-all and Cecchinato’s under pressure when he nets a tame forehand, gifting Thiem a break point. A long rally ensues but hard as Cecchinato tries to match Thiem, the Austrian’s power is too much. He softens the Italian open up with some devilish backhands and then ks a forehand down the line to break. He’ll serve for the first set.First set: Cecchinato 5-5 Thiem* (*denotes server): Cecchinato tries a drop shot and Thiem reads this one, scampering forward to belt a backhand down the line for 15-0. Another missile makes it 30-0 and it’s not long before it’s 40-0. Despite an awful miss with a forehand, Thiem volleys smartly to hold to 15.First set: Cecchinato* 5-4 Thiem (*denotes server): There have been moments when Thiem looked like he was going to run away with this set. Now he’s the one under pressure. He’s the one who’s missing and Cecchinato’s the one who’s causing problems, a backhand down the line helping him carve out a 40-0 lead. The Italian holds to love and Thiem will serve to keep the set alive.First set: Cecchinato 4-4 Thiem* (*denotes server): At 0-15, Cecchinato gets a little lucky with a blocked return off a sharp serve and Thiem’s unable to do anything other than stick the ball into the net for 0-30. The Austrian’s still not got over his confusion by the time he limbers up for the next point, double-faulting to hand Cecchinato three break points. Thiem scrubs them all out, forcing deuce, but he’s facing a fourth break point after butchering a simple volley. He can’t escape this time. Cecchinato bellows as he watches a Thiem backhand sail long and we’re back on serve!First set: Cecchinato* 3-4 Thiem (*denotes server): Cecchinato’s in trouble after double-faulting to make it 0-30. He clambers back to 30-all, though, and then he raises his confidence by drop-shotting and smashing to perfection for 40-30. But the game goes to deuce, Cecchinato unable to keep the errors from infecting his play. He’s starting to get annoyed. But he clings on again. This set isn’t done yet.First set: Cecchinato 2-4 Thiem* (*denotes server): It’s all very precise from Thiem at the moment. He’s not missing much. A fantastic, whipped forehand makes it 40-0 and he holds to love thanks to a fast serve out wide.First set: Cecchinato* 2-3 Thiem (*denotes server): Trailing 0-15, Cecchinato nails his first ace. That was timely. Another good serve makes it 30-15 but then he dumps a forehand into the net. He’s not quite there at the moment. He tries to serve and volley on the next point and Thiem easily guides a backhand pass down the line to make it 30-40, only to waste the break point by netting a backhand return. From there, with the use of one of those nifty drop shots, the Italian holds.First set: Cecchinato 1-3 Thiem* (*denotes server): The first two points are shared. But Cecchinato’s struggling to get into Thiem’s service games.

Cecchinato’s up against it already.First set: Cecchinato* 0-1 Thiem (*denotes server): The first men’s semi-final begins with Marco Cecchinato serving and straight away we’re treated to a backhand battle. It ends with Thiem spraying long. On a sunny Paris afternoon, though, Thiem’s soon showing off his power, ramming a forehand down the line for 30-all. Then Cecchinato knocks a backhand wide, giving Thiem an early break point, but the Italian saves it with a sharp forehand. Thiem’s finding his range, though, earning another break point thanks to more fearsome hitting on the forehand side, and he takes this one when a rasping backhand return forces Cecchinato to send a backhand long.The players are out. They’ve smiled for the cameras, they’ve flipped a coin, they’re knocking up. It’s almost time.It’s 1-1 in the head-to-head between Marco Cecchinato and Dominic Thiem, although they haven’t met since 2014 and have never played each other in a grand slam. That isn’t much of a guide, is it?Once this one’s over, it’s Rafael Nadal and Juan Martin del Potro. Nadal is going for his 11th French Open title, while Del Potro’s just happy to be wielding his hammer. But the Argentinian’s a big threat. He’s beaten Nadal before, albeit not on clay. Hopefully he’s rested well after a tough battle with Marin Cilic.Everybody loves an underdog story but it isn’t all sweetness and light when it comes to Marco Cecchinato, as Kevin Mitchell reports:There is, however, an elephant in the room at this otherwise uplifting party: Marco Cecchinato. His should be the fairytale of the tournament and, to a large extent, it is: the 25-year-old Italian, ranked 72 in the world, who came from two sets down to win 10-8 in the fifth of his opening match and went on to put the former champion Novak Djokovic out in a heart-stopping quarter-final.Yet allegations of match-fixing have hung over him for nearly three years, even though he was allowed off on a technicality when the Italian federation failed to meet a deadline in the appeals process.As detailed in the New York Times last year Italian investigators tapped into WhatsApp messages between Cecchinato and his friend Riccardo Accardi that suggested he might recoup betting losses on Italian football at the 2015 Mohammedia Challenger in Morocco. Accardi and his father used multiple accounts to bet on Cecchinato at 7-1 to lose in straight sets to the world No 338 Kamil Majchrzak, which he did.Cecchinato denied the allegations and appealed – and the Italian federation’s processes broke down to the extent that he escaped without censure. The Tennis Integrity Unit did not respond to  inquiries on Thursday as to whether they were taking the investigation any further.Hello. It’s Dominic Thiem’s third consecutive French Open semi-final and the good news for the brilliant young Austrian is that the man standing on the other side of the net isn’t a member of the Big Five. Thiem was blown away by Novak Djokovic in 2016 and although he gained revenge over the Serbian in their quarter-final last year, he was no match for a rampant Rafa Nadal two days later. This time, though, his opponent is Marco Cecchinato, the world No72. Cecchinato might have made himself one of the stories of the tournament after stunning Djokovic on Tuesday but Thiem really couldn’t have asked for a better draw.Mind you, Cecchinato isn’t to be taken lightly, even though the Italian hadn’t won a single grand slam match before arriving at Roland Garros last month. The 25-year-old, who is the first Italian to reach the last four here since Corrado Barazzutti 40 years ago, has a gorgeous single-handed backhand and he showed no nerves in that mesmeric fourth-set tie-break against Djokovic. Yet Thiem, who demonstrated his clay smarts by thumping an ailing Alexander Zverev in his quarter-final, will be kicking himself if he blows the opportunity to reach a maiden grand slam final.Play begins at: 12pm BST, 1pm in Paris."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e5eca9c2524b3903deff681bf490366553db675/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff3414a445fe623c7acbc6082c788606","title":"julie review polly stenham strindberg lyttelton theatre","story":"Lyttelton, LondonThe Crown’s Vanessa Kirby impresses but this updated version of the class-conscious tragedy is overblownPolly Stenham is not the first dramatist to update Strindberg’s Miss Julie. Patrick Marber’s After Miss Julie relocated the action to the night of Labour’s election victory in 1945. Yaël Farber’s Mies Julie set the story in a post-apartheid South Africa still simmering with racial and class tensions. Both these versions gave the play a strong political context signally lacking in Stenham’s version, which, although well acted – not least by The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby – doesn’t make total sense. In Strindberg’s 1888 original, a count’s daughter fatally seduces her father’s valet. In Stenham’s version we are in modern London, where Julie, the 33-year-old daughter of a rich tycoon, is having a wild birthday bash in her dad’s townhouse. Down in the kitchen her father’s black chauffeur, Jean, who has been deputed to keep an eye on proceedings, passes the time with his Brazilian fiancee, Kristina. The coke-snorting Julie, in turmoil after a breakup with her partner, comes downstairs and demands a dance with Jean that, as in Strindberg, has disastrous results. Strindberg set the play in a world of rigid class distinctions for which Stenham finds no exact equivalent: if today a fat cat’s daughter had sex with a chauffeur, it might lead to chit-chat on social media but would hardly provoke the participants into dreaming of taking flight. Stenham’s solution is to substitute money for class: the gulf between Julie and Jean is here financial. But, although the published version tells us that the play’s two servants are “first-generation economic or political immigrants”, the text itself gives us scant information about their backgrounds. You wonder why Jean would want to run off with an employer who insultingly tells him that “You’re sticking the maid”. Stenham’s answer is to hint that Jean wants to get his hands on Julie’s wealth, but that merely turns him into a cynical opportunist. Put simply, the crisis in Stenham’s version seems disproportionate to the events. Carrie Cracknell’s production and Tom Scutt’s design are similarly overblown. Whatever his misogyny, one of Strindberg’s insights was to realise that his play demanded “a small stage and a small auditorium”. Here the play has to occupy a big theatre. This leads to awkward transitions from the upstairs party to the downstairs kitchen, where the characters confront each other across a space like the Grand Canyon. The party itself looks over-choreographed rather than spontaneous, and the production makes excessive use of that ominous background hum that, ever since Ivo van Hove’s A View from the Bridge, has become a staple feature of cutting-edge productions. Fortunately, the acting is good. Kirby catches perfectly the idea of Julie as a damaged, overgrown child torn between total dependence on others and suspicion that she is seen as a moneybox anyone can shake and rattle. Kirby manages to make her both vindictive and helpless, and when she asks “Am I insane?” it is with genuine pathos. Eric Kofi Abrefa is not helped by Jean’s lack of a backstory but conveys the character’s mix of attraction and repulsion towards the unstable Julie, and Thalissa Teixeira lends Kristina an unusual sexual vibrancy. These actors do sterling work but in Stenham’s version I never felt that the tragic outcome was dictated by an inexorable dramatic force.•Julie is at the Lyttelton at the National Theatre, London, until 8 September.

It is just a few miles from Turkey, but a million tourist miles from Kos and Rhodes, its Dodecanese siblings. It has mostly slipped under the holiday radar, which is a shame because it has everything we all want from a Greek island – beaches, fishing villages, tavernas, ruins – plus an extraordinary modern history. And for that we can thank Mussolini.The Italians grabbed the Dodecanese in 1912 and Mussolini later poured money, and cement, into Leros to make it the base for his imperial ambitions. A huge naval complex was built and a new capital, Portolago, emerged from a mosquito-ridden swamp.This model town is one of the finest examples outside Italy of rationalist architecture (think art deco but without the lightness of touch) and it’s largely intact nearly 100 years later. The broad boulevards, grand villas for the officers, apartment blocks for the lower ranks and market hall are still here. It’s not hard to imagine Italian soldiers and sailors parading along the seafrontThe town, renamed Lakki after the war, was left to rot for decades but the islanders have learned to love it and it is now coming back to life. The cinema (cineleros), for example, now beautifully restored, is very Cinema Paradiso.The second world war left its mark all over the island: in derelict military buildings with amazing murals painted by bored squaddies and in tunnels in the cliffs (a history told underground at the War Tunnels Museum near Lakki, €3). Off the coast lie the wrecks of many ships and warplanes from the Battle of Leros, which inspired Alistair MacLean’s The Guns of Navarone (book es at hydrovius.gr).It also explains why most of us don’t know Leros. Mussolini’s former military barracks held political prisoners during Greece’s military dictatorship and became notorious mental hospitals. (They’re now a refugee camp.) These establishments gave islanders jobs, so tourism wasn’t such a big deal. But times have changed: the prisons and hospitals (though sadly not the camp) are closed, so tourists now focus on the island’s more conventional attractions.The Knights of St John reached Leros 600 years before Il Duce, and the Byzantine castle they conquered and fortified still dominates the island. It glowers over Alinda bay and its beach, the longest on the island. It’s a beautiful spot and the closest little Leros (it’s only about eight miles long) gets to mass tourism. There are many good fish tavernas in the area but locals rate Mylos, which has an amazing setting on the waterfront by a windmill. Like in most places on Leros, a meal for two here shouldn’t cost more than €50, often less.I love the nearby port of Agia Marina, with its ferries bustling back and forth between islands. It’s perfect for a leisurely coffee and some people-watching. If you summon the energy, a short walk up the hill is Platanos, the old capital, with a jumble of narrow lanes and white-washed houses. Panteli beach, below Platanos, is actually prettier than Alinda and I prefer it, largely because of its excellent restaurants, such as El Greco.There are fantastic walks all over the island and on foot is often the only way to get to the many attractive little beaches. One of my favourites is the first cove on the south side of Gourna bay, where there will probably just be some goats to watch you swim in the clear water. And that brings us neatly back to Mussolini and Leros’s fascinating 20th-century story, because it passes a giant second world war acoustic mirror, a precursor of radar. The concrete structure has been recently restored. Mussolini may be long gone but he has not been forgotten on Leros.• Eight-room Archontiko Angelou (doubles from €75 room-only) is a charming 19th-century villa in Alinda behind the seafront. Bianco (doubles from €55 B\u0026ampB) is a boutique hotel in the town centre. Olympic Air has daily flights from Athens to Leros in summer for around €100 one-way. Frequent ferries run by Blue Star  and Dodekanisos Seaways connect Leros with Athens (from about €33), Kos, Rhodes and other Dodecanese islands.

As the former Sex and the City star arrived for a campaign event in Buffalo, New York this week she was greeted by a phalanx of placard-wielding supporters of her opponent, the incumbent governor of the state, Andrew Cuomo.“Cynthia go home,” one poster said, which was a bit rough given the almost 400-mile journey she’d just made from her home in New York City. “This is upstate – nice of you to find it,” said a snarky second. Another said: “Next stop Ithica.”“Very unfortunate,” Nixon conceded as she was quizzed about the gaffe at the event in Buffalo. And for good measure she correctly enunciated every letter: “B.U.F.F.A.L.O.”Hiccups are perhaps only to be expected for a first-time candidate who cut her teeth on the stage, found fame through the small screen and has never before run for elected office. But what is most surprising about Cynthia Nixon’s audacious attempt to unseat Cuomo from the governorship he has occupied for the past eight years is how surefooted it feels.Nixon is positioning herself boldly as the true progressive voice for New York. She calls her campaign a “people-powered insurgency”, fueled by small donors in contrast to Cuomo’s top-down bid for re-election with its $30m war chest, and her rhetoric is as targeted as much against the machine politics of New York’s dominant Democratic party as it is against Donald Trump. She has cut his polling lead from 47 points in March to 22 last month.“We have a governor here in Andrew Cuomo who is not a progressive and is barely a Democrat,” Nixon told the  in Buffalo, New York state’s second largest city. “If he wanted true progressive change he would have done it already – you can’t just play progressive in the months leading up to an election.”If this sounds familiar, it is: Nixon channels more than a little of Bernie Sanders. As a framing for the Nixon versus Cuomo battle, think Sanders versus Hillary Clinton – the radical outlier versus the establishment favourite. She puts it another way: David versus Goliath.Unlike Sanders, who ran before Trump was ascendant, Nixon has the benefit of the post-Trump bounce that is lifting her up as part of a nationwide resistance. “With Donald Trump in the White House we are going in completely the wrong direction,” she told the . “This is a terrible moment for our country, but it is also an opportunity: we are incentivized as never before in my lifetime to make progressive change.”As a further boost, she sees her campaign as part of a related nationwide surge of radical female candidates who are shaking up the Democratic party – most recently in the figure of Stacey Abrams who is vying in Georgia to become America’s first black female governor. “Trump has been a wake-up call for women all across the country who believe, as I believe, that if we want change we have to go out and make it happen ourselves by running for office,” Nixon said.One of the interesting aspects of Nixon’s bid to become New York’s first female governor is her relationship to her own celebrity. She studiously avoids all reference to it – you will hear no mention of SATC in her campaign literature or in her stump speeches.But being a household name is an undeniable advantage in modern politics – not every rookie candidate is given a platform on The Daily Show or endorsed by the Nation – and though she doesn’t labour the point, nor does she run from it. When the  caught up with her at a campaign stop on the New York City subway, where she was berating Cuomo for the diabolical state of mass transit in the metropolis over which he presides, she smiled broadly and shook the hands of passengers who were palpably star-struck in her presence.“I love you!” several riders said, stopping to take selfies with her. But an equal number were complimentary not towards Nixon as Miranda but towards Nixon as would-be governor. “I really like what you’re saying about the subway,” a male passenger said. “I’m a teacher and I’m really appreciative of what you’re trying to do for us,” a woman said.That delicate balance of making the most of her fame without playing to it is more complicated in upstate New York, where voters have a more skeptical approach towards stardom. Though they share the same identity as New Yorkers, the 9 million residents of New York City and the 11 million residents of the rest of the state are in some ways chalk and cheese: voters in economically struggling upstate and western regions of New York state view the city dwellers as “flatlanders” and can scoff at their fashion trends and perceived glamour.“That show, it did a lot to harm family values in this country,” said a man in Buffalo who asked not to be named, referring to Sex and the City.As Nixon builds her campaign ahead of the Democratic primary election against Cuomo in September she is counting on the likelihood that most voters who bother to turn up – whether in the city or in upstate communities like Buffalo – will be committed progressives who will be receptive to her left-leaning pitch. And she believes that her long record of voluntary work, especially as an advocate for public schools, will speak louder than any of Cuomo’s attacks on her for being unqualified or lightweight.“Cynthia is a very down-to-earth, accessible person who really understands people. She connects to people, then links that to policy and what needs to happen,” said Billy Easton, who worked closely with her at the Alliance for Quality Education where he is executive director.In Buffalo she certainly talked the liberal talk as she addressed an art gallery full of activists. During two hours of discussion with about 50 local people she ticked off all the subjects dearest to American progressives’ hearts. As governor she would: address racial and economic inequality and empower people in their communities increase taxes on the super-wealthy to pay for it decriminalize marijuana possession as one of many steps towards emptying out prisons extend rights for undocumented immigrants increase protections for LGBTQ people invest in public education toughen rent laws and combat gentrification fight corruption and end the overweening influence of corporate money in politics.The list may verge on the predictable, but long before she gets to the polling stations it is already having an impact. A discernible pattern has emerged – dubbed the “Cynthia effect” by pundits – whereby she proposes a new leftist policy one day and Cuomo responds with his own version of it the next. You see that with marijuana, where the sitting governor resolutely opposed legalisation until Nixon launched her campaign and then within weeks switched to supporting it. He passively accommodated the bizarre situation whereby seven Democratic state senators side with the Republicans, maintaining a conservative grip on state government, until Nixon declared her run – and then he moved swiftly to reunite the party. He opposed giving the right to vote to 40,000 people with criminal convictions, then did a U-turn once Nixon was in the race.Cuomo’s kneejerk reactions to Nixon’s goading should not be confused with political weakness – the wily and cunning incumbent is very far from conceding defeat. But the responses do suggest signs that we now have game on.And as Nixon stresses, she’s not in this contest just for the “Cynthia effect”. She’s here for one reason alone: “I’m in this to win.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7fc09921ee388e23f8ecd15928a32311a44e0eb/0_251_4147_2488/master/4147.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b0ffe800e0a173eb0aa99df4d706555","title":"fresh free and beautiful the rise of urban gardening","story":"How an urban farms project in Dallas and a fellowship garden in Connecticut are helping their communitiesby  Rachel Obordo and   readersHow an urban farms project in Dallas and a fellowship garden in Connecticut are helping their communitiesby  Rachel Obordo and   readersIn Dallas, Texas, in an area designated as a food desert, meaning access to fresh fruit and vegetables is difficult, Big Tex urban farms have donated 85,000 servings of fruit and vegetables to the community since 2016.Developed for and funded by the annual Texas state fair, the project consists of mobile beds in car parks and a hydroponic greenhouse which allow plants to grow without soil. “The majority of the population in this area relies on small corner stores that do not provide access to quality produce or healthy foods,” said Jason Hays, the fair’s creative director. “Access to modern grocery stores can be inhibited due to pricing, transportation and education. The city tried to lure a large grocer with financial incentives but had no luck. “Access to fresh food options can have a profound effect on the health and wellbeing of iniduals, which can transform communities. I believe everyone should have equal access to healthy options as well as education to improve eating habits.”One recipient, Glenda Cunningham, of the Baylor Scott and White health and wellness centre, praised the project’s work. “The community looks forward to the Big Tex urban farm delivery each week. The food is fresh, free and beautiful,” she said.In Orange, Connecticut, the food production company Watson’s fellowship garden has been running for four years. The company grows produce for food banks and had extra space available, so it decided to expand and has opened its garden to a centre helping children with autism spectrum issues. Christina Cole, 47, a graphic designer at Watson, said: “The plot for Milestones Behavioural Services, which includes a pumpkin and melon patch, gives kids with autism and developmental disabilities the chance to not only have fun and be outside, but also learn life skills and take home what they grow and learn to cook with their families. With the garden season kicking in, we’re getting ready to put in a corn maze.”According to the Connecticut food bank, one in eight people in the state struggle with hunger. “We feel no one should have to think about where their next meal is coming from,” Cole said.The company provides 4,800 plants each year, and those not used are donated to the food bank for use in its gardens. Watson hopes the garden will not only help children but also address food insecurity facing older generations. “Those who are elderly and on a low income used to get vouchers from the state to access fresh fruit and vegetables, but the programme has been cut due to a lack of funding. With our garden we hope to work with the community and help with such issues. Everyone should have access to food, much less something fresh,” Cole said.She said shops were willing to donate food in West Haven but did not have the resources to do so. “I’m in the process of trying to organise the logistics of starting runners to help businesses get food to those who need it most. We’re hoping it will help reduce food waste in the area.” Rose Majestic, the executive director of Wheat, which provides food to people in crisis, said: “The people who comes to us can’t afford fresh produce so Watson’s weekly deliveries go a long way in helping them. We hope other businesses that have yards that can be dug up and used for feeding the hungry in our community start to do the same.”Watson is hosting an event in June to try to get local businesses to start their own community food-growing projects. “In light of the world nowadays, we should all get back to learning to grow our own food. It is the essential basis for survival. It can only further us all to know how to feed ourselves healthily and it’s a great help to have an alternative food source for our neighbours.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

They instead found wads of €50 notes hidden beneath the priest’s chair in the confessional box.Police suspect the money may have been left by a generous benefactor or someone repentant after acquiring the cash through illicit means.“At the moment we are not excluding any hypothesis,” Salvatore Friano, the police officer leading the investigation, told Il Messaggero.“It cannot be ruled out that the money might have been illicitly acquired, maybe as a result of a recent theft or robbery in the city.”The package was found by Father Giovanni Martire Savina. “Until a few years ago every now and then someone would leave substantial monetary offers, even €1,000, but never this much,” he said.“Certainly, such a sum would be useful for the church, but not to the detriment of someone else.”The discovery prompted curious worshippers to flock to the church, with one telling Il Messaggero that “it’s important to go to confession”.Churchgoing has declined in Italy over the last decade or so, as has the number of those seeking absolution, although Catholicism still holds considerable sway over the population."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8e412cbcb14b5f21328b0adc1fd4e9cda2ff025/200_0_2477_1486/master/2477.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9798e493b0940d2bddcfdc336d2a6d71","title":"turkey austria close mosques expel imams","story":"President’s spokesman attacks plan to shut seven mosques and expel up to 60 imamsTurkey’s presidential spokesman has lambasted Austria’s decision to expel up to 60 Turkish-funded imams and shut seven mosques as an “anti-Islam” and “racist” move.“Austria’s decision to close down seven mosques and deport imams with a lame excuse is a reflection of the anti-Islam, racist and discriminatory populist wave in this country,” İbrahim Kalın said after Vienna announced the move in a crackdown on “political Islam”.“It is an attempt to target Muslim communities for the sake of scoring cheap political points,” Kalın tweeted.Austria’s interior minister, Herbert Kickl, said 150 people, including the imams and their families, risked losing their right to residence.The moves come after Austria’s religious affairs authority investigated images published in April of children in a Turkish-backed mosque playing dead and re-enacting the first world war battle of Gallipoli.“Parallel societies, political Islam and radicalisation have no place in our country,” the chancellor, Sebastian Kurz of the ruling centre-right People’s party, said.Kalın, spokesman for Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, suggested the decision was part of efforts to “normalise Islamophobia and racism”, which he said must be rejected.“The Austrian government’s ideologically charged practices are in violation of universal legal principles, social integration policies, minority rights and the ethics of co-existence,” Kalın said.During the Turkish referendum campaign last year on expanding the president’s powers, tensions were high between Vienna and Ankara after Austria said it would not allow campaign-related events.Relations were also strained by Kurz’s staunch opposition to Turkey’s bid to join the EU and the government’s programme that pledged Vienna would not agree to Turkey joining the bloc."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Crime and security editor of The  Conor Lally insists negative briefing \u0026lsquonever happened\u0026rsquoJudge upholds ruling Leonard Nolan was defamed by barman in Grace\u0026rsquos of RathminesFurther blazes expected as sunny weather heats vegetation on the groundLong-time campaigner against Shell Corrib gas project loses High Court caseDefence Forces should have told families of results of investigation into killing and disappearance of soldiers \u0026ndash reportMan took part in film prior to joining the Garda\u0026lsquoWe all want to agree something better.

Photograph: Adrian DennisAFPGetty ImagesBritain will insist a permanent solution to keep the Border open is agreed by October and included in its withdrawal agreement to ensure that a backstop arrangement does not last beyond the end of 2021. Government sources in London said that British negotiators will not agree to a final deal that does not include a permanent, agreed solution for the Border as part of a framework on the future partnership between Britain and the EU that will accompany the withdrawal agreement.Britain’s proposal for the backstop was published on Thursday after prime minister Theresa May defused a cabinet revolt led by Brexit secretary David Davis by including in the document an end date for the backstop of December 2021, one year after the end of the post-Brexit transition period. Under the British proposal, the backstop would see the entire UK remaining part of the EU customs territory.“The UK is clear that the temporary customs arrangement, should it be needed, should be time limited, and that it will be only in place until the future customs arrangement can be introduced. The UK is clear that the future customs arrangement needs to deliver on the commitments made in relation to Northern Ireland. The UK expects the future arrangement to be in place by the end of December 2021 at the latest. There are a range of options for how a time limit could be delivered, which the UK will propose and discuss with the EU,” it says.Brexiteers fear that the arrangement could mean Britain would remain in the customs union indefinitely, with the EU wielding a veto over when it could leave, but the prime minister’s official spokesperson said the UK would not agree to such an arrangement.“We’re not going to sign up to anything which means that the EU can hold us in a temporary backstop when our customs arrangements are ready. At the point when new customs arrangements that meet our commitments on Northern Ireland are ready, the backstop must end. But we will talk to the EU about that as part of the wider negotiation on this proposal,” the spokesperson said.Downing Street insisted that the new proposal was consistent with the commitment Britain made last March that the backstop would remain in place “unless and until” another solution was found for the Border.“The point of the counterproposal is to make sure that if a customs arrangement with the EU is not in place by the end of the implementation period there won’t be a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and that is fully in tune with what we agreed in March,” the spokesperson said.“We are not looking to implement the backstop. We are confident that our system will be agreed and in place.”The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney, who is on a visit to the Middle East, said he would discuss the proposals with the commission negotiating team in the coming days.He stressed that “substantial progress on the backstop” was needed before the EU summit at the end of this month. “Clearly, a great deal of work remains to be done and this needs to be the highest priority for all sides in the weeks ahead,” he said.In Dublin, official sources said that while the British proposals published on Thursday did not constitute sufficient progress in themselves, they provided a basis to engage with the British, which may lead to achieving progress before the summit.Sources conceded, however, that with only two weeks’ negotiating space left before arrangements to finalise the summit are required, the timetable before the summit is extremely tight. The Irish Government has drawn some encouragement from the fact that the British government was now “engaging” with the issues but believes a fundamental breakthrough is still required in June.One senior Irish Government source said while it was obvious that greater detail was needed from the British before the end of June, it was important to “keep the show on the road”.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

Photograph: Robbie ReynoldsThis time last year Leo Varadkar was in the middle of his interregnum. He was Taoiseach-elect but, like a half-finished fitted kitchen, not fully installed. It took a run to the Phoenix Park and the collection of his warrant of appointment to seal the deal, but another run to the Park the day before rather took the gloss off young Leo’s coronation.Remember when Enda Kenny decided his last act as taoiseach would be to assist his outgoing attorney general into a nice job in the Court of Criminal Appeal, via a last-minute dash to Áras an Uachtaráin? It walked the new Taoiseach straight into a monumental row about judicial appointments and him barely a day in office.A year on from those exciting, promise-filled interregnum days, before real life immediately intruded, Leo was back in the Phoenix Park again. The sun was shining, the flowers blooming and the only thing on the Taoiseach’s mind was making sure we all eat enough roughage and go for regular walks with our best pals. “It’s called the buddy concept,” he declared, as Simon Harris simpered gamely beside him. Since the abortion referendum, the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach have been running an awkward three-legged race together – neither, one suspects, that delighted to be shackled to the other. The pair were together again on Thursday morning for the launch of the Healthy Ireland summer campaign, which aims to get people thinking and acting positively about their health. Healthy Ireland – or “Hi” according to the logo – wants us to “walk with friends” and “feel good together” and encourage each other to take the first steps towards a better lifestyle. The launch was in the very lovely Phoenix Cafe in the park’s visitor centre near Ashtown Gate. Or “in my constituency”, as Leo put it. There was a very nice breakfast spread laid on in the courtyard, with not a rasher or sausage in sight and pomegranate seeds sparkling like little rubies on all manner of nutritious treats. We got stuck in to the apricot and coconut energy balls and didn’t feel in the least bit embarrassed when mistaking the gussied-up oats for a bowl of hummus. Little steps, after all, as Minister of State in charge of health promotion, Catherine Byrne, pointed out. “Hi” also wants us to “Share Some Fruit”. So buddies Leo and Simon, along with Catherine, strolled into the Victorian walled garden, where the herbaceous borders are a joy to behold, and prepared for the sharing of the fruit and the taking of the snaps. They were joined by a party of schoolchildren. “Give some fruit to the children!” roared the photographers as the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health posed in front of a stall heavily laden with the most wonderful selection of fruit and veg. “Will yis feed the children!”Simon began handing out cherries. “Here ya go. Have a cherry. Lots of cherries. You can have all the cherries.”Leo gingerly plucked at an apple and held it at a child. We were glad it wasn’t a sharp sort of fruit. The Taoiseach could have taken a child’s eye out with a conference pear. Simon held an apple in one hand and a pear in the other. So Leo held a plum tomato like it was red cricket ball, tossing it the air again and again the way cricketers do.The photographers weren’t happy, but their subjects were. Both men without their suit jackets and their sleeves rolled up – the favourite mode of dress for politicians in the field.“Can we have yis hold up a piece of fruit?” came the latest demand. Leo picked up a strawberry. “Hold up bigger pieces. No. Bigger pieces!” implored the snappers, staring pointedly at a large bunch of bananas. The Taoiseach eyed it up, muttered something to the Minister for Health along the lines of “no bananas” and the two of them laughed and steered well clear. Probably for the best.Then they answered some questions about Brexit and Leo’s visit to Belfast on Friday. He will visit the headquarters of the Orange Order and open the annual Féile an Phobail in west Belfast – a decision that has been criticised in some quarters in the North.“Arlene Foster has spoken at it in the past. I believe the headline act this year is Olly Murs – I don’t think anyone could accuse him of being a diehard republican, so it is very much a community event and I’m very honoured at being asked.” Meanwhile, back at the launch, he gave the audience a potted history of the Phoenix Park and told them they were in a building “which used to be the home of the papal nuncio”. The nunciature is now located nearby on the Navan Road “but is no longer the centre of affairs in the way the Vatican was in the past”.Simon Harris then admitted to being “useless at sport” while the Taoiseach – probably raging his handlers wouldn’t let him wear his running shorts and singlet – smirked beside him. As they left, a number of members of the Dublin Phoenix Nordic Walking Club approached, looking like they were about to attack them with trekking poles. But no, Mary Savage, Patricia Murphy and Freda Kerr were keen to congratulate the two men on the part they played in the recent referendum campaign.“I just wanted to be able to thank them for what they did for women,” said Mary.A nice way for Leo to mark the anniversary of his interregnum.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3523237.1528403868!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a on brexit so what did london propose","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK Brexit secretary David Davis, a hard Brexiteer who threatened resignation if the backstop was not time-limited. Photograph: Will OliverEPASo what is\u0026nbspthis latest thing to have happened in all this Brexit business?After months of awaiting a British response to the EU’s draft proposal around the “backstop” solution – a default plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland post-Brexit – London has suggested its own version of the plan.Wait, what’s the backstop again?To maintain an invisible border, the EU and UK agreed in a political deal last December that if they had not agreed a trade deal post-Brexit or other specific solution for the Border, then there should be a backstop maintaining regulatory alignment North and South to avoid customs checks.Where does the Government stand on this?Dublin is pushing hard for the backstop because, in the absence of a long-term trade deal (which will take years to negotiate) and an alternative solution (several of which have been suggested by the UK and rejected by the EU), this fall-back solution effectively maintains the status quo on the island of Ireland post-Brexit.Did the UK approve of the EU’s suggested backstop?Even though it agreed in principle to a backstop, London said that it could not agree to the EU’s proposed backstop because alignment would only apply to Northern Ireland and in effect establish a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. This caused alarm among the Democratic Unionist Party whose support is keeping Theresa May and her Conservative Party in power in the House of Commons.So what is\u0026nbspMay’s government proposing now?The UK government has formally proposed the idea a “temporary customs arrangement” in a government paper that would apply to the UK as a whole, keeping the entire country in the EU customs union in the event of a failure to reach a deal on customs arrangements with the EU.This backstop would, crucially for ardent Brexit supporters in May’s government and party, be limited in time. It would continue beyond the proposed Brexit transition period, when EU and UK will remain aligned, from the UK’s formal departure in March 2019 until December 2020. This would maintain frictionless trade between the EU and the UK and eliminate tariffs, quotas and customs processes on all EU-UK trade.So how long would this time-limited backstop last?May’s government has said the time-limited backstop will only apply, should it be needed, until a permanent customs arrangement is introduced and that it “expects” this to be in place by the end of 2021.“Expects”? But what if the permanent plan is not in place by then?That is where things get complicated, not just for the upcoming negotiations around whether the two sides can meet somewhere in the middle in time for a summit of EU leaders at the end of this month.This is not a guaranteed cut-off date and the EU would likely reject that because it is temporary in nature, does not protect the EU single market and customs union, and because Brussels had rejected the idea of allowing the backstop to apply to the UK as a whole. But the fudged position keeps the Brexiteers happy because it ensures that the UK will not have indefinite membership of the EU customs union.Why this time-limited backstop?The temporary measure was agreed as a concession by May to quell a cabinet revolt by UK Brexit secretary David Davis, a hard Brexiteer who threatened resignation if it was not time-limited.What does the Irish Government think of the UK proposal?It welcomed the fact the UK has proposed something but it is still assessing it. Prior to the proposal, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar rejected the idea of a time-limited version of the post-Brexit backstop arrangement because, he said, the whole idea of a backstop was that it should apply until there is an alternative in place that maintains a frictionless, invisible border on the island. It should be an “all-weather” backstop, he said.So what next?The formal response of the EU’s Brexit “task force” team of negotiators is awaited.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3523816.1528451149!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"scientists explore deep sea landscape off the west of ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA sponge garden at nearly 2,000 metres below sea level.A deep sea mountain landscape marked by “catastrophic” rock avalanches and giant boulder fields has been mapped by an international team of scientists on the State’s research ship MV Celtic Explorer.Film footage of “sponge gardens” and a skate “nursery” with fish eggs laid at almost 2,000m has also been recorded by the team in an area of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, west of Ireland.The Tosca expedition involved 13 scientists from nine institutions and five different countries including Ireland, Britain, Germany, Canada and Greece returns to Galway on Friday - World Ocean Day.The Marine Institute ship deployed the remotely operated vehicle Holland 1 to explore three mountain ranges on the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture zone during the 3½ week expedition.First investigated in 1966 and named after the US Coast Guard weather station Charlie, the tectonic spreading comprises two parallel fracture zones or “interruptions” of the mid-Atlantic ridge which is estimated to have grown over a 90 million year period.The ridge extends from the Azores and Iceland, with more than 2,000 km of it traced from south-west Ireland, close to the Porcupine Bank canyon, to the north-east of Newfoundland.The team of ocean exploration experts was led by geologist Dr Aggie Georgiopoulou of University College Dublin.“Up to 150 rock and sediment samples amounting to roughly 200kg along with 86 hours of video footage and more than 10,000 sqkm of the zone were also mapped, which is almost the size of Co Galway and Co Mayo together,” Dr Georgiopoulou said.She described the sponge gardens as “spectacular”, and said that the discovery of more than 70 skate eggs was a “first for the deep sea”.Exploring three mountain areas, 500-1000m high scarps were discovered that have been produced by catastrophic rock avalanches, with giant boulder fields spilling into the fractures,” she said.“Although these fracture zones are similar to the San Andreas fault in the western US and the North Anatolian fault in Turkey and Greece, with large earthquakes taking place there regularly, this is the first time there has been a dedicated geological study in the Charlie-Gibbs fracture zone area,”she added.The Marine Institute said the area was first mapped in 2015 on the RV Celtic Explorer as part of the State’s seabed mapping project, Inofomar – and as one of the key projects initiated by the Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance involving Canada, the EU and the US.“The high resolution data produced … in 2015 revealed spectacular landscape with 4,000m high mounds rising from the seabed to 600m below the sea surface, taller than Carrauntoohil, Ireland’s highest mountain, and this has been instrumental in our continued research over the last month,” Dr Georgiopoulou said.“What we have found at the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone surpassed all of our expectations,”she said.Marine Institute chief executive Dr Peter Heffernan congratulated the team, and said deep ocean expeditions “cannot be taken for granted as we need to better understand the features that make up the ocean seabed”.“With the ocean affecting climate change, global population and seafood demand, we need to map our seabed to define favorable habitats for fishing, key sites for conservation, and safe navigation for shipping,”he said.The expedition was co-ordinated by the Marine Institute, with funding from the National Development Plan and the German Science Foundation. The institute says the mapping dataset will be available to the open source Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance “after a moratorium period of a year”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3523838.1528452887!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"austria to close mosques and expel imams in islam crackdown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAustrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz and vice-chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache at a news conference in Vienna on Friday. Photograph:  Leonhard FoegerReutersAustria’s right-wing government plans to shut down seven mosques and expel up to 40 imams in what it said was “just the beginning” of a push against Islamist ideology and foreign funding of religious groups. The coalition government, an alliance of conservatives and the far right, came to power soon after Europe’s migration crisis on promises to prevent another influx and clamp down on benefits for new immigrants and refugees. In a previous job as minister in charge of integration, chancellor Sebastian Kurz oversaw the passing of a tough “law on Islam” in 2015, which banned foreign funding of religious groups and created a duty for Muslim societies to have “a positive fundamental view towards (Austria’s) state and society”. “Political Islam’s parallel societies and radicalising tendencies have no place in our country,” Mr Kurz told a news conference outlining the government’s decisions, which were based on that law. Austria, a country of 8.8 million people, has roughly 600,000 Muslim inhabitants, most of whom are Turkish or have families of Turkish origin. One society that runs a mosque in Vienna and is influenced by the “Grey Wolves”, a Turkish nationalist youth group, would be shut down for operating illegally, the government said in a statement. An Arab Muslim group that runs at least six mosques would also be shut down, it added. “This is just the beginning,” far-right vice-chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache told the news conference held by four cabinet members. Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said the move was the result of an “Islamophobic, racist and discriminatory wave” in Austria and was an attempt to target Muslim communities for political gains. “The Austrian government’s ideologically charged practices are in violation of universal legal principles, social integration policies, minority rights and the ethics of co-existence,” he tweeted. “Efforts to normalise Islamophobia and racism must be rejected under all circumstances.” The ministers said up to 60 imams belonging to ATIB, a Muslim group close to the Turkish government, could be expelled from the country or have visas denied on grounds of receiving foreign funding. A government handout put the number at 40, of whom 11 were under review and two had already received a negative ruling. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3523186.1528400888!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain s remainers are facing a golden opportunity","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Brexit minister David Davis, who threatened to resign this week.

They are run by an organisation called the Arab Religious Community, which the government has also ordered to be shut down.The seventh mosque affected is a separate case. It is to be closed on suspicion of links to the Grey Wolves, a far-Right Turkish nationalist group.The move comes after images emerged earlier this year of children as young as four being made to wear Turkish army uniforms and salute the Turkish flag inside the mosque in Vienna’s Favoriten district.Two imams have received deportation orders, and another 60 are under investigation and could face expulsion along with their family members, Herbert Kickl, the Austrian interior minister, said. They include 40 members of the Union of Turkish-Islamic Cultural Associations in Europe (ATIB), a group close to the Turkish government which is also suspected of links with the Grey Wolves. The Austrian government says it is targeting foreign financing of religious groups as well as what it calls political Islam in the country - but Turkey has reacted angrily, calling the moves discriminatoryTurkey reacted angrily to the move.“Austria’s decision to close seven mosques and expel imams is a reflection of the Islamophobic, racist and discriminatory wave in this country,” a spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.“It is an attempt to target Muslim communities for the sake of scoring cheap political points.”Austria denied that the move targeted Muslims in general and said it was only directed at politicised mosques whose activities were not in line with the country’s constitution.“It is not a contradiction to be a devout Muslim and a proud Austrian,” Gernot Blümel, the culture minister said.Mr Kurz is in coalition with the far-Right Freedom Party (FPÖ) and his government has been accused of fanning populist anti-Muslim sentiment.Six of the mosques to be closed are run by the Arab Religious Community.

On “The Ultracheese” the descending piano chords symbol a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.In a comment piece about the early reactions to the album, culture reporter Jacob Stolworthy also noted how the band were lightyears away from their debut album.The fact is, these four musicians have fully submerged themselves into this venture, into this defined hotel and casino, and are inviting you to check in and do the same, he wrote.Its theatrical production and refined vocal delivery - heavily sprinkled with Turner\u0027s natural musicality and love of Dion, Serge Gainsbourg and The Beach Boys - is the kind that will unlock new doors with each listen.​See more of Aaron Parson\u0027s photography on his website.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

After further study of the field at New York’s Bellevue Hospital, she returned to Columbia as director of its new anaesthesia ision, its first female head of department.Building the unit from the ground up in partnership with her old mentor Dr Allen Whipple\u0026nbsp(who had steered her away from surgery), Dr Apgar\u0026nbspworked tireless as both a practising physician and administrator, no easy task when America’s entry into the Second World War in 1941 created significant staffing shortages.Dr Apgar\u0026nbspdeveloped her five-point score for assessing\u0026nbspnewborn health\u0026nbspin 1952. The test grades babies on scores of zero to two on five key criteria: the colour of their skin, their pulse rate, their reflex ability, their responsiveness to limb flexion and their respiratory rate. The resulting scores are totted up to give a total out of 10 indicating the health or otherwise of the infant in question.The criteria can be remembered by the acronym\u0026nbsp”Apgar”, standing for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration.In 1959, by which point her test had been rolled out across US maternity\u0026nbsphospitals, Dr Apgar\u0026nbspleft the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center to\u0026nbspearn\u0026nbspa Master of Public Health degree from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health and served as vice president for medical affairs at the March of Dimes Foundation to advance the study of birth defects.She was an outspoken advocate for universal vaccinations\u0026nbspto prevent mother-to-child transmission of rubella during the pandemic that struck 12.5m people in the US between 1964-65 and contributed more than 60 articles to newspapers, magazines and academic journals, publishing her book Is My Baby All Right? with Joan Beck\u0026nbspin 1973.Dr Apgar\u0026nbspwas known throughout her career for her warm bedside manner and forthright optimism. In her personal life, she played the violin, enjoyed a range of hobbies from fly-fishing and stamp collecting\u0026nbspand took flying lessons, dreaming of swooping under the George Washington Bridge.Although\u0026nbspshe rarely campaigned against or spoke publicly about gender inequalities, Dr Virginia Apgar\u0026nbspglided past\u0026nbspthe sexism of her period with ease, preferring instead to lead by example and allow her professional excellence and commitment to her work speak for itself.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

While the discovery does not shed light on whether Mars was once home to alien life,\u0026nbspand whether it could still be,\u0026nbspthe findings could be the result of ancient life there.“The chances of being able to find signs of ancient life with future missions, if life ever was present, just went up,” said Curiosity’s project scientist, Ashwin Vasavada of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\u0026nbspExperts say that the findings should propel us to look for conclusive evidence of alien life living on the planet.“With these new findings, Mars is telling us to stay the course and keep searching for evidence of life,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at Nasa\u0026nbspheadquarters\u0026nbspin Washington. “I’m confident that our ongoing and planned missions will unlock even more breathtaking discoveries on the Red Planet.”The new announcement is actually the result of two\u0026nbspnew studies that reveal vast\u0026nbspdetail about how methane exists on the planet, as well as the unexpected organic molecules that are preserved in its soil.And one team has made a significant breakthrough in our attempt to understand the ancient organic matter on Mars, which could help us discover\u0026nbspwhether the world was once habitable and what happened to it in the billions of years since.The surface of Mars is inhospitable today. But in the past, it almost certainly had liquid water, which could have helped fuel life there.The Curiosity rover has headed to an area that was thought to once have been a large lake of that water, inside Gale Crater. It was inside that hole where scientists found the new findings, which suggest the\u0026nbspwater lake had all the necessary ingredients for life – from chemical building blocks\u0026nbspto the energy sources required to sustain life.\u0026nbspThe two studies appear in the journal Science. In a companion article, an outside expert describes the findings as “breakthroughs in astrobiology”.\u0026nbsp“The question of whether life might have originated or existed on Mars is a lot more opportune now that we know that organic molecules were present on its surface at the time,” wrote Utrecht University astrobiologist Inge Loes ten Kate of the Netherlands.\u0026nbspKirsten Siebach, a Rice University geologist who was also not involved in the studies, is equally excited. She said the discoveries break down some of the strongest arguments put forward by life-on-Mars sceptics, herself included.\u0026nbsp“The big takeaway is that we can find evidence. We can find organic matter preserved in mudstones that are more than 3 billion years old,” Ms Siebach said. “And we see releases of gas today that could be related to life in the subsurface, or at the very least are probably related to warm water or environments where Earth life would be happy living.”\u0026nbspThe methane observations provide “one of the most compelling” cases for present-day life, she said.\u0026nbspScientists have long been baffled by the discovery of significant amounts of methane on Mars. On Earth, most methane is produced by biological sources, leading to hopes\u0026nbspthe Red Planet is more alive than we had thought.The new data suggests\u0026nbspthe methane is being stored underneath the surface of the planet. Seasonal changes appear to bring that methane out and onto the surface, where it has been detected by Curiosity,\u0026nbspsuggest the scientists.Another piece of research published simultaneously shows that intriguing organic molecules have been found in ancient rock on Mars. Curiosity took new samples and heated them so that it could analyse the molecules that were released – and the data showed there is certain matter\u0026nbspsimilar to the kind of organic-rich rock found on Earth.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

It really broadens the scope of possibilities.The fossils also provide insights into the evolution of tetrapods from fish during this period.Dr Gess said that the Devonian tetrapods ultimately pioneered the way for our ancestors up out of a dangerous, swampy world into the sunshine and a bright new future.The discovery was made at Waterloo Farm near Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape after the South African National Roads Agency carried out controlled rock-cutting explosions along the N2 highway.This cutting exposed dark grey mudstones of the Witpoort Formation that represent an ancient environment of a brackish, tidal river estuary that contains abundant fossils of animals and plants.The research was supported by the South African DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in Palaeosciences, based at the University of the Witwatersrand and the Millennium Trust.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We now know that every form of Brexit will damage our country and threaten jobs and livelihoods, and even the prime minister is now admitting we are heading for a terrible deal.”Meanwhile, one of Boris Johnson’s ministers provoked fresh controversy when he suggested a second EU referendum on the final Brexit deal would be “possible”.Sir Alan Duncan told an audience in Berlin that voters would not be allowed to reverse the original decision to leave the EU but they would get “the choice would be between the exit deal on offer or having no deal at all”.It comes as MPs gear up for weeks of parliamentary warfare over preparations for leaving the EU, as it was announced that two key Brexit bills will return to the Commons.Cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom revealed that the long-delayed trade and customs bills will both be debated by MPs in mid-July, following speculation the government has kicked the vital legislation into the long grass over fears of conflict with pro-EU rebels.Her announcement came ahead of next week’s Commons showdown over Ms May’s flagship Brexit legislation – the EU (Withdrawal) Bill – where ministers will seek to overturn all 15 Lords defeats during a fraught two-day contest.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Just 0.85 per cent of the public say Brexit has made them less likely to support a united Ireland.Support for the cause is more popular among\u0026nbspthe younger generation than the old, with 49.4 per cent of under-45s backing a break with the UK compared to 37.7 per cent who want to stay in it.\u0026nbspThough Catholics are significantly more likely to support joining the Republic than Protestants, a minority of the latter, 8.5 per cent, say they support leaving the UK. An overall majority (50.2 per cent) in Northern Ireland’s capital, Belfast,\u0026nbspsupport a united Ireland.Northern Ireland has become the focus of Brexit talks because it is set to become the only future land border between the EU and UK. But under the Good Friday Agreement which brought an end to the Troubles, there cannot be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\u0026nbspThough the Government and EU both say they are committed to avoiding a hard border, leaked tapes released on Thursday showed Boris Johnson, the\u0026nbspforeign secretary,\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbspit was “just beyond belief” that the issue was being taken so seriously and that\u0026nbsp focusing on such a “small” item amounted to “allowing the tail to wag the dog”.The YouGov poll also found that 81.3 per cent of the Northern Ireland population do not believe that politicians reflect concerns of the people in the six counties well, while just 17.1 per cent did.Leo Varadkar, the\u0026nbspIrish prime minister,\u0026nbspsaid on Friday morning that a border poll would be “isive” and “a bad idea”.\u0026nbspThe taoiseach, who is visiting Northern Ireland on Friday, told the Good Morning Ulster programme: “We should be respecting the primacy of the Good Friday Agreement and, at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, is power sharing within Northern Ireland, ever-increasing cooperation within the north and south and peace in Britain and Ireland.“While the Good Friday Agreement provides for the possibility of a border poll, and would allow that to pass by a majority of one, I don’t think the time or the conditions are right.“I think the focus should be on getting the institutions up and running again, rather than focusing on a border poll.”His comments came after former first minister Peter Robinson argued that any future border poll could not be conducted on the basis of a simple majority.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I find it particularly interesting that the Israeli tweet uses a meme with women to react to the Ayatollah\u0026nbspKhamenei’s tweet.”Israel’s Mean Girls gif had been retweeted more than 9,000 times and liked more than 27,000 times within a day of being posted.The Twitter exchange came amid growing tensions in the Middle East since Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions on Iran.\u0026nbspOn Tuesday, Benjamin\u0026nbspNetanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, sought to convince European states to abandon the deal, claiming Tehran’s threats to increase uranium enrichment capacity showed it still planned to destroy Israel.Britain, France and Germany are scrambling to\u0026nbspsave the accord, under which Iran\u0026nbsppromised to curb its nuclear programme in return for lifted sanctions.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If he fires at us, we will destroy his forces\u0027​Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to carry out direct military strikes targeting President Bashar al-Assad’s regime unless all Iranian forces are withdrawn from Syria.\u0026nbspThe aggressive ultimatum to Damascus is a significant escalation in the confrontation in Syria between Israel and Iran.The Syrian leader was “no longer immune, his regime is no longer immune. If he fires at us, we will destroy his forces,”\u0026nbspMr Netanyahu declared during a visit to London, speaking at a question and answer session at the Policy Exchange think tank.Israel has carried out a number of air strikes on Iranian bases in Syria and has repeatedly demanded that Iran, which it considers “an existential threat”, must remove its forces and weapons from Syria.But this was the first time that it had been stated that the Assad regime would be punished for the presence of Iranian forces, which have been fighting Isis\u0026nbspand Islamist rebels.Mr Netanyahu said: “I think there is a new calculus that has to take place and Syria has to understand that Israel will not tolerate the Iranian military entrenchment in Syria against Israel.“The consequences are not merely to the Iranian forces there but to the Assad regime as well, I think it’s something that he should consider very seriously.”The Israeli prime minister blamed Assad personally for the presence of Tehran’s forces in Syria as he warned of possible Israeli intervention.“Assad has to consider this: when they waged this horrific civil war, Israel did not intervene. Now the war is nearly over, he invites Iran in to entrench itself?” \u0026nbspThe Syrian leader was accused of facilitating Tehran “to move its army a thousand miles so it can threaten Israel. They want to bring in precision guided rockets with half a ton warheads and submarines to the Mediterranean… Iran does not believe in a master race, it believes in a master faith,” and is bent on conquest, Mr Netanyahu charged.The prime minister is on a tour of Western Europe to try to drum up support for further action against Iran, after US President Donald Trump reneged on an agreement between international powers and Tehran over its nuclear programme.The other signatories to the deal – Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China – as well as the United Nations have all stressed that it was working and the Iranian government was abiding by its commitment.Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Theresa May have told Mr Netanyahu that they are\u0026nbspdetermined not to abandon the agreement, the scrapping of which could lead to nuclear proliferation in the region and beyond, they warned.That, he boasted, had been effectively destroyed by him and Mr Trump.He warned European businesses of the punitive fines they would face under American sanctions if they continued trading with Iran.Mr Netanyahu stated that his aim on the trip, instead, was to “expose” how “Iran is devouring one nation after another” and ask Western European governments to do more “about reversing Iran’s aggression in the region and getting them out of Syria”.The French, German and British leaders have all raised their concerns with Mr Netanyahu about the recent brutal violence at the Gaza border in which dozens of Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli troops.The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, urged the Israeli government to open an independent inquiry into the deaths and injuries suffered during the protests.Asked at the London meeting why non-lethal methods, such as water cannons and rubber bullets, were not used, or even a policy of shooting at legs, rather than shoot to kill, not pursued, Mr Netanyahu insisted: “We have tried all these methods, they don’t work. These were not non-violent protests, quite the contrary.“We are doing everything we can to both minimise casualties and, at the same time, protect Israeli lives.”Referring to Israel’s success in technological innovations, Mr Netanyahu added “given our record, we probably will figure something out, but we haven’t got there yet. The last thing we want is violence or confrontation.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Our research suggests that it was also occasioned by a dislike of its pro-EU stance among some of former\u0026nbspSNP\u0026nbspvoters.Meanwhile, far from simply winning votes as a result of her opposition to a second independence referendum, Ruth Davidson appears to have profited from a swing among Leave voters.\u0026rsquoThe authors said\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbsphad created a \u0026ldquonew line of ision in Scotland\u0027s constitutional debate.Overall some 37 percent of Scots identify as\u0026nbspEurophiles\u0026nbspand 58 percent are\u0026nbspEurosceptics.On independence, the report showed that 45 percent wanted to split from the rest of the UK, the same percentage recorded in the 2014 referendum and a slight fall from the 46 percent experienced in 2016.Forty-six percent said the Scottish Parliament should make all decisions for Scotland, compared with 51 percent in 2015.But there was an increase in those who believed secession would boost the country\u0027s economy.It found that 41 percent of Scots now believe the economy would be improved by independence compared with 26 percent of people in 2014.Support for independence rose among\u0026nbspEurophiles.In 2015 the level of support for independence among\u0026nbspEurophiles\u0026nbspstood at 39 percent, a figure similar to the 41 percent support received by\u0026nbspEurosceptics.Support for independence is now higher among\u0026nbspEurophiles\u0026nbsp(56 percent) than among\u0026nbspEurosceptics\u0026nbsp(40 percent).Ms\u0026nbspSturgeon has said she plans to use the Sustainable Growth Commission report to restart the independence debate, just four years after the country rejected secession.But she has faced a backlash from\u0026nbspLeft-wing\u0026nbspYes supporters for its austerity and proposals to unofficially keep the pound in the short term.A Scottish Conservative source said: Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos\u0026nbspcalculated\u0026nbspthat after\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspvote she could use the result of the referendum to restart her case for independence.It is quite clear this was a serious misjudgment.Far from rallying support for independence she only succeeded in splintering her own grassroots support.But\u0026nbspSNP\u0026nbspBusiness Convener Derek Mackay claimed that independence is the most popular constitutional option.He said: Independence is now the most popular constitutional option, with an overall majority for independence within touching distance.As the Sustainable Growth Commission report has outlined in recent weeks, independence can offer significant benefits to Scotland\u0026rsquos economy, allowing us to improve growth and boost jobs right across the country.Meanwhile, Ian Blackford the SNP\u0027s Westminster leader has tabled amendments to get Theresa May\u0027s key Brexit legislation changed.It comes amid a long-running row between Holyrood and the UK Government over the Prime Minister\u0027s EU Withdrawl Bill.He will today tell the 2,000 delegates that his party will always protect Holyrood\u0027s powers and accuse Tories of wanting to destroy the founding principles of devolution.But Scottish Tory deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said the SNP was meeting as a house ided following spats over its plan for yet another referendum."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/brexit-news-uk-eu-latest-european-union-971097.jpg","title":"Brexit news UK EU House of Lords European Union backstop agreement","story":"Despite being temporarily sidelined from the Brexit debate while the EU Withdrawal Bill is sent back to the House of Commons, peers have asked EU and UK negotiators to identify \u0026ldquoareas of mutual interest.The Lord\u0026rsquos EU Committee has published a report on post-Brexit UK-EU relations as various battles between Brussels and Westminster rumble on over the Northern Ireland backstop.Peers are very keen to stress the importance for the UK \u0026ldquothe greater the benefits sought from the new relationship, the greater the comprises that will be needed as trade negotiations kick off.\u0026ldquoBoth sides of the debate have argued \u0026ldquono free lunch for either the UK or EU can be delivered while Brexit negotiations continue.Brexit news: Theresa May pushed by House of Lords to agree to \u0027lasting\u0027 EU dealLords are debating whether new relationships will come at a cost and require trade offs or political declarations.Lord Boswell, chairman of the House of Lords EU Committee, said: \u0026ldquoTime is running out for a framework to be established for the post-Brexit UK-EU relationship.

and hit a notably different tone than the one she adopted to address her Remain supporting MPs earlier this week.Mrs May said in her letter: To put it frankly, if we are to make good progress in the negotiations and deliver the smooth, orderly and successful Brexit the country wants, we need to agree with the EU the terms of the backstop.We have a choice between the Commission\u0027s proposal, which however hypothetical must be unacceptable in principal to anyone who believes in the Union of the United Kingdom and an alternative that is unpalatable but, at worst, temporary.\u0026lsquoIt doensn\u0027t mean Brexit!\u0027 Portillo BLASTS Brexit backstop \u0027nonsense\u0027Andrew Neil warns UK has been \u0027outmanoeuvred\u0027 over Brexit backstopThat is why we are advancing this proposal.The news comes after she faced down a Cabinet revolt led by Brexit minister David Davis and agreed to a plan that could keep Britain tied to certain parts of the European Union after Brexit in 2019.The backstop proposal, which is at the centre of a devastating Cabinet row, aims to stop Britain entering into certain types of trade deal.The proposal states that if the country and EU cannot negotiate a deal, it would remain in the EU-wide framework of trade deals.Theresa May faced down a revolt led by Brexit Secretary David DavisIt would be able to implement only those parts of new free trade deals not covered by this temporary customs arrangement.This points to the fact that it would be impossible to strike a trade deal involving goods, since the UK would have to maintain EU tariff rates.Aides close to EU Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier claimed that he welcomed the publication of a new proposal.They say he also added that arrangements would have to last as long as was necessary to avoid a hard border in Ireland.Writing for Express on May 31, leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg echoed the notion that the UK needs to fully leave the customs union to honour the Brexit vote.Mr Mogg said: The customs union membership is binary and Leave won.Alas, the Treasury has wasted precious months coming up with complex and unworkable alternative models that prove this essential point.The truth is that leaving the EU\u0026rsquos customs union is necessary to keep faith with the referendum result and reap the benefits of Brexit.If we remain in it we will accept EU laws, collect EU taxes and have ourselves a trade policy where we are without any say \u0026ndash a vassal state."},{"url":null,"title":"weather","story":"A BLAST of roasting air from Africa is about to engulf Britain triggering the start of what is...ALLERGY sufferers are on alert for hay-fever hell this week as warm weather triggers a pollen...MEGA-HAILSTONES bigger than golf-balls had today damaged properties and injured pedestrians in...MASSIVE thunderstorms brought fresh flooding and travel chaos to Britain yesterday -

Italian households have one trillion euros in bank accounts and roughly \u0026euro750billion of that is in overnight deposits.Professor Marcello Minenna, a Target2 expert at Bocconi University, Milan, said the national bank\u0027s liabilities to Target2 are rapidly increasing to \u0026pound525bn (\u0026euro600bn).Mr Minenna said: I fear it is going to become more extreme. The Target2 imbalances show there is something fundamentally wrong with the construction of the euro.It is a measure of pressure, and if you keep adding pressure, the glass will break at some point.But questions are being asked as to how long Germany will tolerate Italy\u0027s soaring debts, with some German economists warned Target2 is morphing into a means of financing capital flight from Europe.Professor Phillip Turner, of the UK\u0027s National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said the politics of the Target2 mechanism are poisonous and had left Germany feeling exposed.Mr Turner said: This is lending on a huge scale that no government has approved.

Instead, Brexit has made both independence and the SNP relatively less popular among those Scots who are not very enthusiastic about the EU, even if they did vote to Remain.“So far this has been a tendency to presume that the fall in SNP support in the 2017 election simply represented a rejection of the party’s plans for a second independence referendum.“Our research suggests that it was also occasioned by a dislike of its pro-EU stance among some of former SNP voters.He added: “Meanwhile, far from simply winning votes as a result of her opposition to a second independence referendum, Ruth Davidson appears to have profited from a swing among Leave voters.“That leaves Ms Davidson with an electorate whose views on Europe are in many cases strikingly different from her own.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Petrie-Harrison and Jackson, of Basingstoke, admitted burglary.They all got suspended prison sentences of between 12 and 16 months.But despite the convictions, the dogs could not be returned to their owner because they did not have microchips.Ms Cowling said: “This is two years later and I am still very anxious.

His first arrest was in 1992 but it took another 23 years before his victims were taken seriously.Aides of Charles said this week that the royal is prepared to send a witness statement to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), answering whatever questions it has. Ball, lauded for his work alongside vulnerable youths, was also close to then Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey.Last year, a report found that Lord Carey, now 82, and other senior Church of England figures “colluded” with Ball to prevent him facing criminal charges and failed to protect his victims.But Ball’s gilded life in the top echelons of the Church of England came crashing down in October 2015, when he was jailed for sexual offences against boys as young as 15, dating from the late Seventies to the early Nineties.His trial heard how he chose young priests to share his bed, forced them to take cold showers while he watched, and got one man to roll naked in the snow before towelling him dry and beating him until he bled.Ball is now a free man living in Somerset, having served half of his 32-month sentence. His rise to power began in 1960 when he established a monastery in Gloucestershire with twin brother Michael, also a bishop.Ball became known for showing “favouritism” to novice monks, and he embraced the opportunity to speak in schools. It later emerged that was where he met five of his victims. As his influence grew within the Church he constructed a powerful social network, regularly dining with Margaret Thatcher at posh London hotel The Savoy, often in his monk’s habit.When he became Bishop of Gloucester in 1992, it was not long before he used his position to get close to Charles, whose Highgrove estate came under his diocese. This friendship was tested that December when Ball was arrested for the first time for gross indecency.One of his trainees, 16-year-old Neil Todd, alleged that Ball had forced him to rehearse “penitential psalms” naked in the middle of the night so he could “feel the cold”.Ball made him take cold showers and expressed a desire to whip Neil so badly his body would “bear the marks”.Another six young victims came forward with similar stories after Neil reported the abuse to the police.As part of Ball’s 2015 trial, the court heard that, backed by “Cabinet ministers, the Royal Family, MPs, JPs and a lord”, he escaped with a caution over the 1992 allegations.He quit as Bishop of Gloucester and settled into retirement in a Duchy of Cornwall property rented to him by Prince Charles in the village of Aller, Somerset. He was still allowed to officiate at services, including more than 20 at schools.According to an independent report commissioned by Archbishop Justin Welby and published last year by Dame Moira Gibb, Ball’s brother, Bishop Michael Ball, wrote at the end of 1992 to Lord Carey, saying his brother was receiving support from prominent figures.It emerged that Lord Carey had lobbied police and prosecutors on Ball’s behalf, while treating the disgraced bishop to a holiday and a £12,500 pay-off.Dame Moira wrote: “Peter Ball abused many boys and men. That is shocking in itself but is compounded by the failure of the Church to respond appropriately to his misconduct.”But it was Ball’s friendship with “confidant” Charles that is seen as most alarming.As well as regularly corresponding, praying together and attending Charles’s 2005 nuptials, he was invited to address mourners at the funeral of Major Bruce Shand, the Duchess of Cornwall’s father, in 2006.Lord Carey retired in 2002 and was succeeded by Rowan Williams, who in 2007 announced the Church would investigate historic sex cases. A 2008 Church review of Ball’s case found seven letters of complaint received by Lambeth Palace in 1992 had been ignored, with revelations of nakedness, masturbation and assault.These were disclosed to police and Operation Dunhill was launched in July 2012. After surviving two previous suicide attempts, victim Neil Todd took his own life, aged 38, after this new investigation began. Ball finally appeared at the Old Bailey in 2015. The trial heard from 18 victims but it is believed there were more than 100.Ball was jailed after admitting to two counts of indecent assault and a charge of misconduct in public office as part of a plea bargain He was released in February last year, and moved back to Aller.It is unclear whether he still lives in the rented Duchy property. A week-long examination of the case will take place next month, held by the IICSA.On Wednesday, counsel to the inquiry Fiona Scolding QC confirmed witness statements had been requested from Prince Charles and his private secretary.Charles’s name is in the clear — but is his conscience?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is what makes it so dangerous.Even half a pill can be a dangerously high dose on its own and the risk is increased if alcohol and other drugs are taken at the same time.He warned some pills contained 300mg of MDMA - three times a strong dose for an adult male.Super-strength ecstasy alone caused the deaths of more than 60 people in England and Wales in 2016.Police across the UK have already shared stark warnings against taking illicit substances, stressing the dangers of taking pills with unknown ingredients.Hampshire Police have launched an investigation into the deaths of Georgia Jones, 18, and Tommy Cowan, 20, after the pair died while attending Mutiny Festival.Festival organisers issued an urgent warning about super-strength drugs circulating the campsite before cancelling the second day of the event, attended by tens of thousands of people.Parklife festival, in Heaton, Manchester, shared a photo from drugs testing NGO The Loop to warn revellers, saying a VERY strong batch of pills were in circulation.The festival’s official Twitter account posted: “No doubt you have seen in the press about two very sad tragedies at a festival over the weekend.“There is a VERY strong batch of pills in circulation, with strength over 330mg.“These tablets, along with others, can result in death. Please act responsibly \u0026amp look after each other.”The Loop is an NGO that campaigns for and provide drug safety testing at music festivals.Blue Punisher ecstasy pills the group tested in Bristol last week were found to contain 300mg of MDMA, more than three times the normal dose in a pill.Other tablets found by The Loop included “Silver” ecstasy which could contain up to four times the regular dose.A third heart shaped pill was said to contain pentylone instead of MDMA which can cause insomnia and paranoia for anywhere between 12 and 48 hours.West Yorkshire Police also issued a warning to the public about the dangers of drugs after officers stopped a group of teens in the town of Castleford in Wakefield on June 5.Two girls were arrested on public order offences before being taken to hospital, and a 13-year-old boy was later arrested in connection with drugs-related offences.It is believed the young girls had taken Snapchat pills.West Yorkshire Police said the two girls had since been released from hospital, with no further action taken after their arrests. The teen boy was also released under investigation.The force tweeted: We want to remind the public about the dangers of drugs. Drugs are often given catchy names to appeal to young people. Other festivals have taken to extraordinary lengths to ensure the safety of music fans.Dorsets Bestival announced it will offer on site drug testing at the festival.A spokesperson said: Bestival strongly advises festival goers to avoid taking any illegal substances.However, harm reduction and customer welfare are our priorities, so we have made the decision to bring The Loop onboard to offer drug safety testing onsite, giving people the opportunity to make informed choices."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Biker1.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"biker lorry run over head back wheels","story":"In the footage, the moped rider falls and becomes trapped in the path of the back wheels of the truck - and although his helmet is crushed, he appears to be unscathed.Filmed earlier this week in Cainta, Philippines, the biker is in a line of traffic when he attempts to pass the lorry on its right side.But as he overtakes, the moped appears to clip the kerb and the bike shudders before toppling to its side - tossing its rider in the path of the lorrys back wheels.Thrown face first to the road, the biker is trapped momentarily by the wheels as it rolls over his head.As traffic slows around them, he then makes several attempts to stand up.Although his helmet is almost flattened, miraculously, the biker appears to be unscathed.The clip, which was filmed by a vehicle travelling behind them, then shows the other moped riders rally around the man and manage to stop the lorry.He removes his green helmet and manages to stand up and - although he appears dazed - he stumbles to the footpath and kneels beside his bike."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000411857885.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"schoolgirl 11 becomes one of uks youngest entrepreneurs by opening a diner","story":"The ambitious schoolgirl designed every part of the restaurant, from the décor to the menu, inspired by her entrepreneur dad Matt Haycox who started his first business at 15.Harlie was influenced by her time spent living in Las Vegas where, at the age of nine, she created her own holiday-themed milkshakes for the family business Sticks and Shakes.She said: “When we were in Las Vegas, we would import English chocolate bars because they were much harder to find and everyone loved them.“My favourite flavour of milkshake is Dime bar, but I also really like Oreo-flavoured desserts.”Harlie’s Diner has a hot pink colour scheme, a menu which features American classics like hot wings, waffles and shakes, and even has fuchsia chopper bikes to make deliveries to the people of Leeds.Harlie enlisted help from her school friends to sample the menu and select the best flavours for the US-inspired meals and shakes.The restaurant is family-friendly but, like the diners she visited in Vegas, it stays open until six a.m. on weekends to cater to the local nightlife.Harlie’s father, Matt, 37, is the co-founder of Harlie’s Diner and primary investor of his daughter’s new venture and is happy to pass on his business know-how.Harlie said: “My dad has taught me a lot about using social media to grow a business, so I’m really getting the hang of it.“I’ve become a bit of an Amazon and eBay expert, finding all sorts of fun, neon signs to put up on the walls of the diner.“I’ve used this and Instagram to help bring the diner to life, encouraging customers to snap pictures and use hashtags.“I’m really pleased with my most recent purchase of two angel wings, that you can stand in between and take pictures of yourself in front of them.”Her dad is proud, but is pleased to let his daughter take the lead with her new business.He said:  “It’s a really exciting opportunity for Harlie and I’m thrilled to see her take the reins and spearhead the business.

The Foreign Secretary has been secretly recorded boasting to right-wing Tory activists about Brexit, Trump and North Korea at a private dinner. Leaked to BuzzFeed News and The Times, the remarks are embarrassing at best. And at worst they\u0027re not only deeply unprofessional - they undermine the entire govenrment. Mr Johnson steamrollered Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan and campaigned hard for his own vision in the address to Conservative Way Forward.  He ridiculed warnings about Brexit as pure millennium bug stuff, dismissed official claims his customs plan will cost \u0026pound20bn a year, and said: I\u0027m not going to hide it from you, there is an argument. A lot of this isn\u0027t surprising - and Tory MP Gerald Howarth today even said the tape serves a valuable purpose for Brexiteers. But some of his comments went much, much further. Here we analyse the most eye-popping bits of what Boris said - and why it could come back to bite him. 1. Donald Trump should do Brexit  What he said: Boris said he is “increasingly admiring of Donald Trump and more and more convinced that there is method in his madness...Trump to negotiate Brexit , what a fantastic idea... Imagine Trump doing Brexit. He’d go in bloody hard. There’d be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he’d gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere. It’s a very, very good thought.” Why it\u0027s a problem: This exposes the way Boris thinks - preferring chaos to his boss\u0027s \u0027strong and stable\u0027 mantra. It inflates the US President\u0027s large ego just as the world is supposed to be taking him down a peg over steel tariffs. And it\u0027s a direct attack on Theresa May, suggesting she\u0027s inferior to another world leader and not getting anywhere with her Brexit talks. 2. Brexit will trigger a meltdown and the EU is the \u0027enemy\u0027  What he said: “I think Theresa is going to go into a phase where we are much more combative with Brussels. You’ve got to face the fact there may now be a meltdown. OK? I don’t want anybody to panic during the meltdown. No panic. Pro bono publico, no bloody panic. It’s going to be all right in the end.... Take the fight to the enemy - absolutely right. We need to and we will. Why it\u0027s a problem: It\u0027s utterly extraordinary that a minister is admitting his own strategy will trigger a \u0027meltdown\u0027 and could cause \u0027panic\u0027. It\u0027s also hugely damaging to Theresa May\u0027s constant efforts to tell Brussels she\u0027s approaching Brexit talks in a co-operative way. Describing the EU as the \u0027enemy\u0027 is a definite no-no from the UK\u0027s top diplomat. 3. The \u0027heart of Remain\u0027 Treasury is a \u0027quivering wreck\u0027  What he said: The Treasury, which is basically the heart of Remain... What they don’t want is friction at the borders. They don’t want any disruption of the economy. So they’re sacrificing all the medium and long-term gains out of fear of short-term disruption. Do you see what I\u0027m saying? The fear of short-term disruption has become so huge in people’s minds that they’ve turned into a quivering wreck. The Project Fear is irreversible! They’re terrified of this nonsense! It’s mumbo jumbo. Why it\u0027s a problem: Again, it is extraordinary for a serving government minister to attack his own government like this. It\u0027s no secret that the Treasury, under Chancellor Philip Hammond, is pro-Remain. But here is Boris attacking civil servants too as terrified and quivering wrecks. It\u0027s certainly not in the spirit of collective responsibility, where each minister is meant to agree publicly with the whole government. And it\u0027s likely to sour relations even more between warring Cabinet ministers. 4. US has asked him to dismantle Kim\u0027s nuclear missile  What he said: Of course we’ve got to help the Americans do this thing…. I just talked to Mike Pompeo, my counterpart in the US State Department. What they want us to do is to use our nuclear expertise to dismantle Kim Jong-Un’s nuclear missile. That’s what he asked me to do today.” Why it\u0027s a problem: North Korea, of course, knows Britain wants it to dismantle nuclear weapons. But usually talks between allies are conducted in private with only brief summaries provided to the media. Civil servants who work on national security go through exhaustive background checks and are given firm instructions not to talk about their work. This kind of highly sensitive detail is an extraordinary thing to be casually revealing to activists at a private dinner. 5.

When the leaders of the world’s richest countries meet today in Canada, Britain will need our Prime Minister to stand up for the country’s workforce. The UK’s steel industry and its 32,000 employees are under threat from President Donald Trump’s reckless decision to jack up tariffs on steel, and Theresa May must take a lead at the summit in calling him out. The Trump tariffs are simply wrong.  They are bad news for British workers and industry. They are also bad news for US workers and industry. It is vital that all the leaders come together to condemn the Trump tariffs. We need to stop the escalation of a tit-for-tat trade war that can only be bad news for all workers and businesses. As I told the GMB trade union conference in Brighton this week, US workers are right to want a government that actively supports them and the real, everyday economy.  But the Trump tariffs don’t do that. And neither does the Trump agenda of giving handouts to the super-rich, while propping up a rigged system that hoards power and wealth for a tiny elite. Whether it’s over Trump’s Muslim ban and his shameless promotion of the far right Britain First group, his dangerous decision to abandon the Paris Climate Accord or his wilful tearing up of the Iran nuclear deal, Theresa May has repeatedly shown she doesn’t have the courage to stand up for what we all know to be right.  The Tories want to appease Trump in the hope of getting a quick trade deal with the US after we leave the European Union. But what their reaction to the Trump tariffs show is that with the timid Tories in government, we’ll end up with worst kind of race-to-the-bottom deal.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, his deputy Tom Watson, and even Tory Brexit minister Suella Braverman joined forces to back our call for recognition of Britain’s nuclear test heroes. They met Shirley Denson, 83, widow of RAF ace Eric who was subjected to radiation experiments, as well as Doug and Sandie Hern whose daughter Gilly died at the age of 13 after her dad was exposed to the fallout from five different bombs.  Corbyn told the Mirror: The UK government put these men in harm’s way by asking them to take part in nuclear tests with little to nothing by way of protection. The veterans have had to live and die with the repercussions ever since. “A medal is the first and least thing we can do to right the wrongs these veterans and families have endured, and I fully support the Mirror\u0027s campaign to give them the recognition they deserve.” It is an historic win for the Mirror’s campaign, as it is the first time any party leader has met a nuclear veteran and agreed to back them. Visit petition.parliament.uk/petitions/220170 to sign the online petition.  The MPs were joined by comedian Al Murray, better known as the Pub Landlord, who has joined the campaign. He said: “My dad and my father-in-law were both National Servicemen so they could have been in these tests. The same could be true for any one of us. “The Military Covenant demands we look after our veterans, but anyone in the forces today would look at what’s been done to these guys and see that for a lie. It’s wonderful to meet them, but absolutely horrifying to hear their stories first-hand.” Government minister Suella Braverman was among the Tory supporters. She said: “It’s really important to hear their stories of decades-long struggle and what their families have had to put up with. I think there would be a lot of support for this campaign and Parliamentary interest if we can get this heard.”  The MPs heard how Ministry of Defence documents showed Eric was exposed to 65 years’ worth of radiation in just 6 minutes while he flew through the mushroom cloud of Britain\u0027s biggest nuclear bomb in 1958. Scientists knowingly maximised his exposure, and were aware of the risk of genetic damage. Eric’s descendants have a 37% rate of birth defects and widow Shirley, 83, from Morden, south London, blames his later suicide on the effects of the radiation. Former navy cook Doug Hern, 81, and wife Sandie, 72 from Spalding, Lincs proudly showed them a photo of their daughter, and told how during two years of treatment for adrenal cancer she was photographed daily, but three hospitals now claim to have lost all records of her treatment. Studies have shown a third of the veterans were dead before 1999. Their wives report three times of the normal number of miscarriages, and their children show 10 times the usual rate of birth defects. Visit petition.parliament.uk/petitions/220170 to sign the online petition. Birmingham MP Jess Philips said: “I can’t think of any word to call it other than premeditated murder. It’s a total dereliction of duty on the part of the MoD and it shouldn’t be the responsibility of the veterans to prove the link. The link’s obvious.” Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry added: “The point is that nuclear veterans are recognised by other countries and it’s shameful that ours does not. The moment has come for them to be given justice. Stoke-on-Trent MP Ruth Smeeth said: “The veterans have had to wait much too long and we now need actions, not words.” Shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne added: “We must recognise the sacrifices they made for our country and right these wrongs. It’s time for the government to act.  Labour MP for Dagenham and Rainham, Jon Cruddas, added: “A lot of people have felt the consequences of our nuclear tests and it’s absolutely brilliant the Mirror is making sure we don’t forget them. With 155,000 descendants of our nuclear veterans, there isn’t a constituency in the country that won’t be affected.” Tory grandee John Hayes, patron of the British Nuclear Test Veterans’ Association, said: “It’s a human tragedy that transcends party politics. Oldham MP Jim McMahon said: “When people step up to do their service for the nation it’s important that service is recognised. It’s a fantastic campaign by the Mirror.” Visit petition.parliament.uk/petitions/220170 to sign the online petition. Shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith vowed to put pressure on opposite number Gavin Williamson, who was conspicuously absent. She said: “It’s high time that our brave nuclear veterans were recognised with a medal. It’s a simple thing that the Defence Secretary can do very easily, without admitting liability. Former Treasury minister Liam Byrne said: “This is a matter of justice and duty and the government’s shameful treatment of some of our bravest veterans who put themselves right in the danger zone has got to be stopped, now.” Burnley’s Julie Cooper said: “I’ve been quite affected hearing about it. It’s such a small thing to do, the MoD can have no excuse for not giving a medal. There was also support from the House of Lords with Labour peers Baroness Alicia Kennedy and Lord Roy Kennedy, and cross-party peer Baroness Bryony Worthington signing the petition. Ealing MP Rupa Huq said: “It’s been eye-opening to learn what happened to these men. The public should hear and the government must listen.  Morden MP Siobhan McDonagh paid tribute to Mrs Denson, saying: “She has been relentless and determined and without thought for her own health. We must honour the nuclear veterans.” Maria Eagle said: “A medal seems to be the least we could do. It’s a scandal that for years the real suffering that’s resulted has not been recognised by the nation. Angela Eagle added: “It’s a really worthwhile campaign and the test veterans deserve recognition for the sacrifices they made. Brentford and Isleworth MP Ruth Cadbury said: “What’s really surprising is so many countries acknowledge responsibility and ours is the only one that doesn’t. The issues are not going away, in fact more children are being born with birth defects every day. Ilford\u0027s Mike Gapes said: “This has been a scandal for decades and the veterans have never had the recognition they deserve. We must rectify it urgently.” Tan Dhesi from Slough added: “I can’t understand why the government is the only one on Earth not to recognise the risks the nuclear veterans ran.  Chesterfield MP Toby Perkins, Sheffield’s Louise Haigh, Khalid Mahmood from Birmingham Perry Barr, Colleen Fletcher from Coventry, shadow health secretaries Paula Sherriff and Barbara Keeley, shadow veterans minister Gerald Jones, deputy speaker Rosie Winterton, Chris Elmore from Ogmore, shadow children’s minister Emma Lewell-Buck and Southampton’s Royston Smith were also joined by Tories Andrew Stephenson from Pendle, Banbury’s Victoria Prentis and Mark Menzies from Fylde. Mr Menzies said: “The least we can do is consider a medal for these veterans but in reality we need to do a hell of a lot more. Also supporting were Andy Slaughter from Hammersmith, Diana Johnson from Kingston upon Hull, shadow culture minister Kevin Brennan, Phil Wilson of Sedgefield and Yvonne Fovargue from Makerfield. Shipley MP Philip Davies pledged his support to the campaign but added: “I won’t deal with the Mirror.” Visit petition.parliament.uk/petitions/220170 to sign the online petition.

Supporters of teams in the top two divisions have been banned from standing at games since Lord Taylor\u0027s report into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster - in which 96 Liverpool fans died. But calls have been growing for restrictions to be eased to boost atmosphere. Critics of the current rules point out many fans simply stand anyway and there are hopes a change could bring down spiralling ticket costs. Labour today unveiled a new policy to let clubs, fans and safety authorities decide. Shadow Sports Minister Rosena Allin-Khan said: “Clubs, fans and local authorities know their stadium far better than anybody in Whitehall - the decision should rest with them.  This is about safety the current system isn\u0027t working, people are standing in unsafe seated areas and accidents can happen.  Labour\u0027s backing comes days after it emerged the government had begun talks with the Premier League and EFL over the possibility.  MPs will debate safe standing on 25 June after more than 100,000 fans called for the move in a petition. Labour\u0027s plan would cap the number of safe standing places at 7,500 per stadium, in line with Football League proposals. Ms Allin-Khan announced the policy after visiting Liverpool and holding private meetings with Hillsborough families, who are still split on whether to bring back standing.

Alexandra Quadrelli sculpted the \u0027ultimate revenge body\u0027 after being called fat by her ex, who she claims cheated on her multiple times. The 29-year-old from Perth, Australia, was paranoid her partner would leave her when she bulged to 15st 6oz - about 98kg - after getting the contraceptive implant. Fearing her current partner would stop finding her attractive and battling depression because she hated her appearance, she started taking 123Diet Drops and a clean eating plan. In under four months the deli assistant, originally from Milan, Italy, shed a whopping five stone - more than 31kg - from sticking to the plan without exercising. Alexandra said: Before I felt bad, frustrated, ugly, unhappy and unhealthy. I constantly had the fear of going out and having a social life because I was scared others would judge me.  My life was constantly hiding my body under large clothing, I hid myself from everyone. I always loved going to the beach but when I was a heavier weight, I was too shy to wear a swimsuit or to go shopping because I was frustrated that there weren\u0027t suitable clothes for me. I was unhealthy, unhappy and I was so scared of losing my actual boyfriend because an ex-boyfriend was so rude to me, always cheated on me and would regularly tell me how fat I was.  So I told myself no, not this time. I started to take better care of myself because my health is more important and secondly, because I wanted my boyfriend look at me in different way. Now, I love my body, feel sexy and better about myself but more important than anything else, I\u0027m healthy. I love myself more and my boyfriend sees me in a whole new way. I will always be grateful to 123Diet.  Now I have a revenge body for all the people who are discriminated against their weight I have a revenge body for my ex-boyfriend who was humiliated because of my appearance and to show myself I can do anything. Alexandra says she never struggled with weight problems in the past, until having a contraceptive implant and the stresses of moving to Australia three years ago. This led her to hit her heaviest weight when she had a BMI of 34.9.

Charlie Bush was trying to impress a group of youths when he carried out the random attacks at a funfair during the Dartmouth Royal Regatta last August. The former Tottenham Hotspur triallist has two previous convictions for offences in which he used knives. He was on bail at the time for using a fake pistol to terrify a passer-by who he terrorised in the street. Bush was 14 at the time of the attacks but has since turned 15.  He had moved to Devon from London where he was involved in gang violence. In 2016 he posted a Youtube video in which he brandished a knife and threatened to stab rival gang members while burning one of their bandanas. The attacks at the regatta happened when he led a group of youths who knew him by his gang name of Charlie Little Man and approached three boys aged 15 to 17. One suffered a serious wound to his forearm as he tried to fend off the stabbing attack.  The others suffered a cut hand and a slashed cheek.  Bush, of Colley End Road, Paignton, admitted two counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, one of wounding, and one of using an imitation firearm to cause fear of violence. He was ordered to be held for four years and six months under a detention and training order with a one year extended licence by Judge David Evans at Exeter Crown Court. He said: These offences were committed to maintain and enhance you fearsome reputation. T That is a thread that runs through your offending history. Your street status is so important to you that you are willing to terrify or stab people. These stabbings were committed at a public festival in front of other people and friends of the victims. You were part of a large group, of which you appeared to be a leading figure.  This terrifying attack has left a legacy of physical wounds and psychological effects. They are worried in their teenaged years about going out and about.  Why should you create that fear and anxiety to other people just because you feel you want to be respected. I don\u0027t think you understand what the word respect truly means. Taking account your active role in gang violence and your proclivity to arm yourself with knives, it is clear you pose a risk of causing serious harm. Mr Nick Lewin, prosecuting, said at the time of the stabbings in Dartmouth, Bush was on bail for the gun offence in which he approached a man who was walking home with two women in Paignton. He followed the victim, pulled out the air pistol, cocked it, and fired it.  The victim had no idea it was not real until air, rather than a bullet, came out. Bush was with a large group of youths at Abbey Gardens in Dartmouth on the last night of the regatta when he attacked each of the victims separately. The first victim, 15, was stabbed on the palm as he tried to escape. He needed four stitches.  The second, also 15, saw the first stabbing and was slashed across the face as he ranaway. The final attack was on a 17-year-old who suffered a 8 centimetre wound which cut through muscle and needed an operation to repair with internal and external stitches. He spent two days in hospital. Mr Lewin said:All three victims have made impact statements saying how they have been affected in their studies and social lives. All three are fearful of the repercussions because of Charlie\u0027s reputation. All three have been left with physical and emotional scars. They were all very frightened.

Scots are claiming it\u0027s the worst year ever so far for the presence of the ravenous flies in the country. Scott Sweeney, from Inveraray, Argyll and Bute, works outdoors as a deer manager says the midges make it difficult to get any work done. The 31-year-old shared a shocking video clip of hundreds of tiny midges clinging to his hands and buzzing around him as he sat on a hill with his dog Leah. The post gathered more than 1,400 likes and was shared at least 1,200 times as Scots warned each other to be prepared when hitting the outdoors.  Scott said: I would say the midges are worse than ever this year. They maybe started later as the winter lingered on a bit, but now they have arrived they have just exploded the last few weeks. He added: They are always bad, but I don\u0027t think I have ever seen this before in my life. They may well calm off, but at this exact moment, they are the worst ever. They may have arrived a little bit later due to an unusually cold start this year, but midges are back with a boom and terrorising Scots. Lucy Fraser, from Rowardennan, Stirling, says she has become a prisoner in her own home and revealed that a contractor was forced to stop laying new decking at her property because the midges were so bad. Dr Alison Blackwell, from the Scottish Midge Forecast, backed the claims and said that despite the slowest start to the midge season in three years - midge spray has been flying off the shelves this week as they reemerge.  Midges typically begin to come out during the end of May, and in June the female biting midges arrive to kick off the season. In 2017 a record number of 68 million midges descended on Scotland - a 40% rise on the year before - but experts have not revealed this years\u0027 estimated figures yet. However, Scots across the country have taken to social media to share their midge misery. Lucy Fraser runs her home as guest house for walkers taking on the West Highland way and has to give them a stern warning not to open the windows - or suffer the consequences. The 57-year-old posted a photograph of midges infiltrating a lamp outside of her home. In the space of last week hundreds of the tiny critters filled up the glass case almost to the halfway point. The hotelier said: I insist the guests don\u0027t open the windows. If they do it\u0027s horrific and believe me some do and regret it. Each year from the end of May to October I become a prisoner and wouldn\u0027t dare go out the door before 10am and after 5pm. This is when the midge is at its worst, the sun keeps them away but the rain attracts them. I\u0027ve been here 22 years and it gets worse every year.  The mum-of-eight added: Trying to get tradesmen to work here between May and October is impossible as no one could work outdoors without being driven insane. I\u0027m trying to have a deck area built and the guys said they have never seen anything as bad and even though I gave them a huge fan they said they had to abort the job. I\u0027ve known these guys many years and they have done lots of work but just couldn\u0027t cope this year. They said it\u0027s first time ever he\u0027s had to leave a job due to midges. Social media users were quick to share their shock at the state of the midges already. Lynn Bindon said: A zombie apocalypse has nothing on Scotland\u0027s midge season. Stay safe people.

Dawn Cranston 45, and Denise Cranston, 70, remained “emotionless” and “calm” as the paramedics administered CPR for 50 minutes, the jury heard. Jordan Burling died on an inflatable mattress, weighing just six stone at his home in Farnley, Leeds. Yesterday Leeds Crown Court heard how Denise, looked blankly on in silence from an armchair as the ambulance team pronounced him dead.  Dawn asked a police officer at the scene, calmly, How much does a funeral cost?, the court heard. Jordan’s mother was in the kitchen and remained “calm” when she was told by the paramedics. The paramedics who were first at the scene yesterday told a court how they arrived at 11.16am just six minutes after Dawn’s 999 call. Describing Jordan’s physical state when they arrived one of the paramedics Bridgett Sheppard said: “He was very, very pale and you could see every bone. “His eyes looked sullen and I noticed he looked to have an adult nappy on. “I asked the mum why Jordan was so thin and she responded saying he hadn’t been eating for a few weeks.  “But I remember thinking he shouldn’t be as thin as he was after just two weeks of not eating. “The mum didn’t seem bothered by what was going on or seem in a state of shock which seemed unusual. “The grandma was just watching us from an armchair at the far side of the room, the TV was on and she didn’t say anything. “Even as we performed CPR she didn’t seem bothered just sat very straight-faced with no emotion.” Paramedic Robert Tiffany who arrived at the scene in an ambulance with Ms Sheppard on June 30, 2016, said: “Jordan was unresponsive, unconscious and after three minutes of us being there his heart stopped.”  Speaking of Dawn and Denise’s “unemotional” reaction he said: “This was an extremely unusual and stayed in my mind.” “It was an unusual house, very cluttered and piled high with boxes and bag.I’ve never seen anything like it before,” he added. The court heard how the paramedics requested the police attended the scene. Prosecutor, Nicholas Lumley QC has told the court that Jordan had not had a healthy or happy life. As a young boy, Jordan went to the local primary school, where he soiled himself and defecated on the floor.  Mr Lumley QC said: “He had head lice and his teeth were in a very poor state. “Jordan went on to Farnley Park High School, but after a couple of terms, his mother wrote to the local authority, telling them that she intended to home school him. “He never attended school or college again, never took any examinations or achieved any qualifications.” Mr Lumley QC told a court that Jordan became increasingly anonymous from the moment he was taken out of school. “Education and social services played little part in his life,” he added.

Harry, who wed Meghan last month, hosted a gala for the On Side Youth Zones charity at Kensington Palace on Thursday night. The 33-year-old wore a black tux to the vent where he laughed and joked with guests. On Side Youth Zones provides spaces for leisure activities to eight to 19-year-olds, particularly those from deprived areas. Funnyman David Walliams was the host for the evening and introduced Harry as a newly married man.  Meghan did not attend the gala but will join the royals on the balcony at Buckingham Palace for the Trooping The Colour ceremony tomorrow. Harry wore a tuxedo at the event where he made a speech and met young people involved with the charity. Later in the evening, guests were entertained by 80s singer Rick Astley.  The exact details of Harry and Meghan\u0027s honeymoon are still unknown but it\u0027s believed they stayed in a luxurious cabin a national park in Canada before jetting to Ireland for a visit to Ashford Castle .  Rumours earlier this week suggested the royal couple had checked into the 13th century castle in Cong, County Mayo on Ireland\u0027s west coast. Rooms cost between \u0026pound600 and \u0026pound4,000 a night and those in the are tweeted that the castle was on lockdown because of the special visitors. Rachel Forde tweeted: The first time I go to Ashford Castle and we couldn\u0027t get into the [actual] castle and around it because the royals are within.

Sally Holmes, 41, put a suitcase, some wall fans and a mini cooler on the pavement outside her house on Thursday afternoon.  Although she admits she didn\u0027t leave a note, she said she was doing it, as she has before, so someone passing by could make use of them rather than just throwing them away, reports the Nottingham Post .  Nottingham City Council, on the other hand, considers this fly-tipping and therefore \u0027illegal\u0027.  A Community Protection officer knocked on her door in the town of Bulwell, near Nottingham on Friday morning to tell her to bring it in and expect a \u0026pound75 fine to arrive in the post, which it now has. Miss Holmes said she is fuming about this and added: As soon as she came to the door I took them in. I disagree with it, once I took the stuff in she should have told me \u0027don\u0027t worry about it, but don\u0027t do it again\u0027. I have not fly-tipped, I have got stuff that is useful so people that have seen it can take it, it is recycling rather than just throwing it away. They are just trying to get money out of people. It\u0027s ridiculous and very stressful. She also argued that the items had been neatly piled outside the house, with the fans and cooler in a bin liner.  She understood that if she had tipped the contents of her green bin on the road it would be a different matter but this was not causing a problem. If she pays in 10 days the fine is reduced to \u0026pound50 but if she does not pay it at all she says she could end up in court and landed with a \u0026pound2,500 fine. However the council is tough on fly-tipping and said that people wanting to leave stuff outside for people passing by to pick up should instead take it to a charity shop or try their neighbours.

One 20-year-old woman said that “Men sending girls pictures of their bits is literally the new ‘hi’.  Victims and academics want a law which could leave the sender at risk of becoming a sex offender, reports ChronicleLive.  Newcastle-born model Rebecca Sayers claims she’s been sent obscene pictures in the past, adding: “It leaves me disgusted.  “If they did this in a public place, it would be a sex offence and they would be arrested. “The law has to change.” Rebecca, 29, is one of several women demanding a standalone law, similar to ‘revenge porn’ legislation, amid fears current laws aren’t a strong enough deterrent. Currently, sending a snap of your genitals to a stranger is not in itself illegal, although culprits can be prosecuted for offences such as harassment. The House of Commons Women and Equalities Committee has launched an inquiry into sexual harassment of women and girls in public places. Giving evidence this week, Clare McGlynn, a Professor of Law at Durham University says current laws and policies “are only catching up with these behaviours”.  And for some women, a change can’t come quick enough. “I don’t know a woman my age who hasn’t been subjected to this,” said one Newcastle 24-year-old, who asked not to be named. She said it was so common, it had become the “norm” for a woman to expect to receive them. “We are all subjected to it yet we suffer in silence,” she added. “Women shouldn’t just be laughing it off though, it is basically cyber-flashing and in my opinion it is criminal and a sex offence.” All but one of the women we spoke to declined to be named due to the nature of the subject. But many had similar experiences, claiming men verbally abused them if they were asked to stop.  Others claimed they were pestered by men who had set up fake accounts after being blocked. And some said the x-rated snaps had almost become the standard chat-up line for some men. “Men sending girls pictures of their bits is literally the new ‘hi’,” added one North East 20-year-old. “Apparently they think we actually like seeing pictures of it - personally it makes me sick. “It’s so common now and it’s become such a normality for girls to get them, girls won’t report every single one they get.” All the women interviewed said they receive the pictures via Snapchat. The app allows people to send snaps which disappear after a few seconds.  A spokesperson for the app declined to comment, but every woman interviewed - including Rebecca - felt the firm could do more. “If the picture goes on a story and you report it time and time again, they finally seem to step in, but I don’t think they do enough,” said Rebecca. “And all the blokes do then is create a new account and start again, so it isn’t stopping anything.” Another woman added: “I’ve blocked someone but they just create new accounts and fake Snapchat names and adding me, before sending more pictures and harassing me. “It is despicable.”  The US-firm insists users can only send snaps to those who have accepted friend requests. It also has a reporting function. One woman admitted deleting “randoms” she’d added as friends, who then sent her rude snaps. But she added: “Accepting a friend request doesn’t give men the right to do what they want.” In the Commons, Prof McGlynn highlighted YouGov research which found that 46% of women aged 18 to 36 said they have been sent an unsolicited photo of a penis. And Newcastle Central MO Chi Onwurah is calling for tech firms to do more.

Pearl Fernandez, 34, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole while her boyfriend Isauro Aguirre, 37, was sentenced to death for the death of her son Gabriel.  The pair bit, whipped and beat little Gabriel Fernandez in catalogue of horrific attacks at their home in Palmdale, California.  In the months leading up to his death, Gabriel was covered with pepper spray, forced to eat his own vomit, regularly gagged to stop him from speaking and locked in a cabinet when he complained, the court heard.  Fernandez and Isauro also burned him with cigarettes, whipped him, shot him with a BB gun, starved him and fed him cat litter. The boy was kept gagged and bound in a cubby until he was found, a Los Angeles County District Attorney\u0027s Office heard. Before reading their sentences, Judge George G. Lomeli said their conduct was horrendous, inhumane and nothing short of evil.  You want to say that the conduct was animalistic, but that would be wrong because even animals know how to take care of their young, some to the extent that they would sacrifice their own lives in caring for their young, Lomeli said as he stared directly toward Fernandez and Aguirre in the court room, reports ABC .  He then told a touching story of a news report he once watched about a mother cat who kept going into burning building to save her kittens.  Judge Lomeli continued: I can only wish...that in the middle of the night you wake up, and you think of the injuries that you subjected on this poor young man, this poor 7-year-old, and that it tortures you. Last December, the jury recommended that Aguirre be sentence to death after he was convicted of first-degree murder and the special circumstance allegation of murder involving torture. In February, Fernandez pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and admitted to the torture special circumstance allegation in order to get life in prison without parole. If the case had gone to trial and she had been convicted as charged, she would have also been facing the death penalty.  At her sentencing hearing, Fernandez read an apology letter out loud, saying she hopes one day her children can forgive her.   I want to say I\u0027m sorry for what happened. I wish Gabriel was alive. Every day I wish that I\u0027d made better choices. I\u0027m sorry to my children, and I want them to know that I love them, she said.   Gabriel\u0027s brother Ezequiel, who was 12 at the time and is now aged 16, and sister Virginia, who was 11 at the time and is now aged 14, gave heartbreaking evidence last year. Ezequiel said Aguirre would punch and kick the boy and pick him up by the neck until he passed out. The court went silent as a cabinet recovered from the home was rolled in. Ezequiel said the couple nicknamed it \u0027the box\u0027 and would handcuff Gabriel inside for hours on end without food or water. He also saw Aguirre beat Gabriel with a buckle and metal hanger while he was naked. He said his mum and Aguirre would often laugh as they beat the boy together, calling him gay.

He has uncovered ties to Dundee and is appealing to anyone who may have known his mother, whose birth certificate he has not found.He believes his mum, Irene Miller or Millar, was born in Canada but grew up and worked in Dundee. Mervyn thinks his maternal grandmother travelled to Canada while pregnant, but returned to Scotland shortly afterwards.He has found a cousin, Freda, and an uncle, Raymond, who live in Dundee, but neither has been able to shed much light on the mystery. Freda’s mum also lived in Dundee and Mervyn suspects she and his mum would have hung about together.He said: “It would be a great satisfaction to know what happened to her. We just can’t find a birth certificate. In a jute mill or other factory, everyone knows everyone so there might be someone in Dundee who knew my mother.”Irene ended up in Liverpool working as a prostitute but that is where the trail goes cold.His father is even more of a mystery, but as Mervyn is mixed-race he believes a man from Pakistan, India or Sri Lanka came to Dundee for the jute industry.Born with spina bifida, Mervyn spent much of his childhood at a children’s centre in Edinburgh.

last season the surface was the envy of most of their second-tier rivals, the board have stumped up five figures to make sure it’s even better next term and beyond.They announced this week the

the Betfred Cup group matches kick off there in as little as six weeks.The work being carried out will also improve drainage – something that has been a problem, particularly in the area near the tunnel at the Eddie Thompson Stand end of Tannadice.And, while most of the budget for the next 12 months is going on putting together a squad capable of winning promotion, chairman Mike Martin is viewing the pitch project as a sound investment.“We are investing in our on and off-field operations in a structured way with every aspect of our work designed to deliver improvement throughout the club,” he said.“In this case, we aim to make sure that Tannadice continues to be one of the best surfaces in the country for playing professional football.”Those Betfred Cup fixtures are expected to

We would fully expect this to be appropriate to the scale and seriousness of the unauthorised works undertaken.”In his report Mike Galloway, executive director of city development, lays out the arguments for and against the three possible options.The report notes that: “The unauthorised demolition of a Listed Building is a significant breach of National Legislation as reinforced through the comments by Historic Environment Scotland. Taking no further action is not considered to be an appropriate response”.Under consideration of serving an Enforcement Notice the report says it would not be an appropriate course of action because the building: “…has now been completely demolished and materials removed from the site”. Any restoration would not be reasonably practicable.When looking at whether to recommend reporting the matter to the Procurator Fiscal Mr Galloway’s report says: “There was frequent correspondence between council officers and the owner’s representatives late in 2017.“The information that was provided by the owner’s representatives, in the opinion of Dundee City Council engineers, clearly confirmed that while defects were present, demolition was not the only option to preserve safety or indeed the building.”It goes on: “Given the nature and the lack of notification or contact with Dundee City Council prior to the commencement of the demolition process, it is considered that this displays a disregard for the statutory process.”The report therefore recommends that Dundee City Council reports the matter to the Procurator Fiscal.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"promising signs as csaba laszlo begins to create new dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe summer of change at Tannadice has only just begun but the new-look Dundee United side is starting to take shape – what kind of shape are they in exactly, though?So far, the Tangerines have decimated last season’s pool with almost a full matchday squad list heading out the door.That left them with a skeleton squad before their business really got started last week.Five faces are in the door with the few players manager Csaba Laszlo wanted to keep given new contracts.More will be coming in during the next few weeks but, right now, how are they shaping up?GoalkeeperDeniz Mehmet looked certain to be the man between the sticks this season but for his knee injury picked up at the end of last season.With Harry Lewis heading back to Southampton after his loan, highly-rated youth keeper Josh Donaldson is the only fit goalie at the club.Verdict: A goalkeeper is certainly on the shopping list.DefenceTwo defenders have been brought in already this summer in Sam Wardrop and Callum Booth.Booth is expected to be first choice at left-back ahead of Jamie Robson while Wardrop will battle it out with Stewart Murdoch on the right.Though Murdoch has slotted in at centre-half, there is a big gap to be filled in that position.William Edjenguele, Tam Scobbie and Lewis Toshney are still around but Csaba and head scout Paul Sturrock are certainly looking for two starting centre-backs.Verdict: Big gap to fill in the middle but full-back positions look solid.MidfieldFit and healthy, Dundee United’s central midfield places are pretty much sewn up.Fraser Fyvie and Sam Stanton are the club’s stand-out talents at the moment and will occupy the middle of the park without doubt when available.In reserve is Scott Allardice after he signed a new one-year deal.Out wide, Fraser Aird has been brought in to play on the left side while Billy King is likely to start on the right.Paul McMullan hasn’t always been Csaba’s cup of tea but showed at the start of last season how effective he can be from the wings while youngster Matty Smith has slotted in out wide at times, though is nominally a striker.Verdict: Centre is strong when fit but numbers needed for a long season.AttackThe biggest capture so far by the Tangerines has been striker Nicky Clark coming from Dunfermline on a free transfer.The former Queen of the South and Rangers man has scored 29 goals in his last 62 matches in the Championship and is tasked with being Csaba’s main goal threat.Also in is former Ross County striker Craig Curran.The battling forward has never been prolific but his job will be to provide ammunition for Clark, while knocking in a few himself.James Keatings, too, is still around at Tannadice after a season beset by injury and personal problems. He’ll seem like a new signing if he can rediscover the form that helped Hamilton, Hearts and Hibs gain promotion to the top flight.Verdict: Looking good up top.Overall: With just 18 first-team players on the books, work is obviously still to be done but initial signs look promising. Adding solid defenders, however, is vital.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b192bd1b6fb8.jpg ","title":"sturgeon pledges 10m more for dundee va

ideas such as the installation of a mezzanine floor and the creation of more open space could be the key to the transformation of Inverness\u0027 Victorian Market.Since taking up the role of market manager six months ago, Jo Murray has been exploring ways in which the historic site\u0027 future viability can be secured as well as meeting traders and other interested groups regularly.Suggestions, which have now been put forward, include extending opening hours, revamping shop fronts and hosting events as well as taking a radical look at the how the market hall section might be remodelled in a bid to attract local residents to shop at the historic landmark.\"The Victorian Market is very much loved by the local community but the local community doesn\u0026rsquot necessarily use it,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We need to encourage local customers to come in and shop.\"Under the action plan, a proposed programme of work is set be carried out in three phases.The first priority is to refurbish the stonework at the market\u0027 Academy Street entrance and replace the glass door.\"It is a really iconic entrance,\" Mrs Murray said.\"But I think it is recognised the smoked glass which has been installed is a bit of a visual barrier to the market. The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential. With the future of the British High Street in decline at the moment, we need to look at as many options to make it viable for all business and attract new brands into the city centre.\"Friday 8 Jun 2018 1:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04109000/04109721.jpg","title":"Casual attitude proves a winner for Fortrose cafe","story":"\u0026nbspA BLACK Isle cafe has been named Scotland\u0027 best choice for casual dining at the third Scottish Hospitality Awards.Fortrose Cafe won the north casual dining title at the awards ceremony at the Crowne Plaza Glasgow Hotel, before going on to beat the three other regional winners to the overall Scottish title.Owner Janet Gray admitted that even when she looked at the official winners photographs from the night, she found it hard to believe they had won both the local and Scottish titles.\"It came as a complete surprise,\" she said.\"The competition was really strong in the north finals.

group stage worth to aberdeen","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen will bid for a Europa League group stage jackpot of more than £3 million next season.That figure could be much larger, even before television and gate revenue.UEFA have confirmed the prize fund for the Europa League and it is 50% up on last season.The Dons begin their quest to reach the lucrative group stages for the first time under boss Derek McInnes when they enter at the second qualifying round on Thursday July 26.Former Dons striker Darren Mackie scored the “£1 million goal” in the 1-1 draw with Dnipro in Ukraine in October 2007 to secure a spot in the then UEFA Cup groups.Reaching that level is worth millions more to the Dons should they achieve their target.McInnes insists having European football can help lure new signings to Pittodrie for the upcoming season.He has already secured midfielder Chris Forrester from Peterborough on a three-year-deal for a fee of £200,000.McInnes said: “When talking to players I always say there is the likelihood of European football with Aberdeen.“Having that confirmed for next season can only help when trying to sign players.”The basic cash reward for qualifying for the 48-team group stages is 2.92m Euros (£2.57m).There are added payments in the lead-up to the groups with prizes of 260,000 Euros (£229,000) for progressing past the second qualifying round and a further 280,000 Euros (£247,000) for moving beyond the third qualifying round.Reaching the group stages brings a basic combined total of £3,046,000.However, the group stages also bring an added coefficient share of 84m Euros divided between the 48 teams depending on each side’s UEFA ranking.The club ranked lowest of the 48 teams will receive 71,430 Euros (£62,890)One share, ie 71,430 Euros, will be added to every rank so that highest-ranked team will receive 48 shares (3.42m Euros).If, for example, Aberdeen were the 38th-ranked team they would pocket 10 times 71,430 – 714,300 Euros (£628,900).Further cash bonuses come through performance in the groups with a payment of 570,000 Euros (£502,000) per win and 190,000 Euros (£167,000) per draw.The Reds will discover their second qualifying round opponents on Tuesday June 19 when the draw is made at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.Aberdeen have exited at the third qualifying round for the last four successive seasons.McInnes’ side have lost out to Apollon Limassol (Cyprus), NK Maribor (Slovenia), Kairat Almaty (Kazakhstan) and Real Sociedad (Spain) at that stage.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/5b1a1bb94cb23-431x564.jpg ","title":"harry potter actor to star in dr dolittle at aberdeens

the leading role is really the icing on the cake.”Mark became a household name with The Fast Show, before starring in all seven Harry Potter films and also as crime-solving priest Father Brown.As well as a successful screen career, he is an acclaimed stage actor including with the Royal Shakespeare Company.He is taking on the role of Dr Dolittle made famous by Rex Harrison in the film version.This new stage production is part of the 50th anniversary celebrations of the original movie.It will feature the same songs, including the Oscar-winning Talk To The Animals.It tells the story of the eccentric doctor who embarks on an extraordinary adventure to find the Giant Pink Sea Snail that holds the secret of life and makes the world a happier place.Helped by his human companions and an

£900 to purchase a Seabin for the town’s harbour.The piece of equipment costs £3,000 and can be submerged to collect waste 24 hours a day using a pump to suck rubbish from the sea surface.The idea came from warrant officer Grant Duthie, who saw the environmentally-friendly piece of equipment advertised online.Officers at the company are delighted with the amount raised so far.Warrant officer in the company section Ryan Clark said: “We wanted to do a fundraiser for something a bit different, hence the choice of the Seabin.“It was originally suggested through our president’s badge boys’ meeting by Grant Duthie, who also volunteers for the local lifeboat crew and it went from there.“It’s now a company section goal to raise the money through various fundraisers, such as coffee mornings, sponsored sports challenges and other events.“Originally, our plan was to raise the money over a couple of years, but with the speed that we’ve raised funds already, we hope to have it done in maybe over a year or so.”Once the Seabin is full it can be emptied and the contents recycled.It can catch everything floating in the water, including plastic bottles, paper and fuel.Fish are not caught because they do not get close enough to the surface to be pulled in.Clean water is then pumped back into the sea, helping to keep pollution levels down.The group, one of three Boys’ Brigade

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament.

He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

The council believes this will make the process faster and easier for people thinking about building their own home.A community information and feedback event will be held on Wednesday June 6 at Lochgilphead Community Centre from 1pm to 6.30pm, with presentations scheduled for 2pm and 5.30pm.Anyone interested in the Simplified Planning Zones is invited to attend and will be able to ask questions, get involved in shaping the design and find out much more about each of the proposed sites. The events are as much about getting input and feedback from the community as they are about offering information on the Simplified Planning Zone sites.David Kinniburgh, the council’s policy lead for planning and regulatory services, said: \u0026#8216The idea behind the Simplified Planning Zones is to remove obstacles for people who want to build custom or self-build homes. There will be a lot of great information available at these events and I would encourage everyone with an interest to attend and find out more about the proposals.\u0026#8217More information is available by email on spz@argyll-bute.gov.uk or by calling 01546 604158.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands of entries set for royal highland show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 01/06/18, 9:40 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe UK\u0026#8217s premier agricultural show will once again showcase the country\u0026#8217s finest livestock, as thousands of animals vie for the honour of being crowned champion.Organisers of the event Royal Highland Show, supported by The Royal Bank of Scotland, are preparing for what will be an exceptional display of livestock, with well over 5,000 entries for all sections of the show.The Highland Hall will again be at maximum capacity, housing almost 1,100 beef and dairy cattle, with commercial cattle recording their highest number for entries in the last decade, standing at 93 animals up from 75 last year, an increase of almost 25 per cent.With 104 entries, the Shorthorns are set to dominate this year, up from 88 entries in 2017. The Simmentals are hot on their heels with 103 entries, a 10-year record  and an increase from 85 in 2017. And the Charolais are also seeing a resurgence, with a jump to 76, from 61 last year.The numbers in the dairy section total 109 entries, with the largest class being the Ayrshire with 38, up from 29 in 2017. Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25. This year\u0026#8217s Queen\u0026#8217s Cup will be in the dairy class.Sheep entries once again command the Royal Highland Show with 2,029 animals making this the second largest number of entries in more than a decade.Leading the way is the Texel section with 182 entries, with the Beltex close behind with 177. Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries. Highland females lead the way with 94, with Shetland females closely behind with 84.In 2009 the show separated the Welsh C and Welsh D classes due to increasing demand, and that has proved to be winning formula with record entries again this year, with 43 and 59 respectively.Royal Highland Show Manager David Jackson, said: \u0026#8216The Highland continues to be the leading event for showcasing the very best the livestock industry has to offer, and it extremely rewarding that the industry continues to recognise its importance as a platform for the sector.\u0026#8216We continue to see very strong entries, with increasing numbers in many sections, especially in the commercial classes, and I know we will see some fierce competition for a winning place.\u0026#8216As an event, we grow year on year and attract new audiences as we widen the appeal for visitors from town and country. Yet we remain true to our roots as an agricultural show and work hard to be truly relevant to all aspects of farming and rural life.\u0026#8216The Grand Parade always proves to be a high point of the show and gives us a chance to celebrate the commitment and dedication of all our cattle and heavy horse exhibitors. I recommend everyone to make time to observe this truly spectacular display.\u0026#8216The team look forward to welcoming all our exhibitors, from the Scottish islands to South West England to Northern Ireland. They are dedicated to their craft, and I am extremely grateful for their continued support and wish them all the best of luck.\u0026#8217Supported by Royal Bank of Scotland, the 178th Royal Highland Show will take place at the Royal Highland Centre, Ingliston, Edinburgh, on June 21-24.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"springwatch spotlight on tarbert","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 07/06/18, 12:17 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert has featured on the popular BBC nature show Springwatch.An underwater segment stirred up a buzz on social media with its inside look at the colourful world just beneath the waves.Diver and cameraman Andy Jackson took to the bottom of Loch Fyne to view what he called ‘an underwater garden’ and the wonderful creatures within.The segment was aired on Tuesday June 5 and is available on BBC iPlayer for a limited period.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr uniteds ian mccall lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United\u0027s Ian McCall and Lawrence Shankland bag Ladbrokes awardsIt comes after Ayr United won the League One title, with an impressive 124 goals in all competitions.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet15:23, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland win the Ladbrokes League 1 Manager and Player of the Year awards (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland have bagged an awards double.

The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

Following a long battle with neuroblastoma, the 17-year-old died peacefully surrounded by dad Chris, mum Connie, and sister Olivia. It was a fight that captured not just the hearts and minds of Ayrshire, but the world beyond. Vanessa, who displayed courage which belied her condition, would rarely be seen without a smile on her face. For almost a decade, her name became synonymous with the fight against the aggressive cancer. Almost \u0026pound1million was raised with the aim of sending Vanessa abroad for life-saving treatment. That dream was realised and in January 2013, the family received the news they longed for – that the cancer was in remission.  Vanessa would return to school and rejoin classmates as a hugely popular figure at Marr College. Life, as normal as it could ever be, was good again for this inspirational girl. But the cancer would return and spread to Vanessa’s brain, with her family receiving the crushing news that her condition was terminal. As ever, Vanessa fought bravely until the last before she passed away just days short of her 18th birthday. Now her family are vowing that her fight will live on in her legacy. Dad Chris told the Post: “We are devastated at our loss.  “Vanessa was a huge inspiration to Connie, Olivia and I and so many more. “She achieved lots during her short but fulfilled life, she did everything she wanted to do and lived life to the full. “She never complained about anything, even though her situation was dire and she knew it. “We are privileged to have had such an inspirational and beautiful daughter.”  Vanessa’s funeral will take place on Friday, June 22 at 11.30am at Dreghorn Crematorium and then on to Troon Town Hall for a Celebration of Life. Chris added: “We’d like to ask that people wear bright colours and for the gents not to wear black ties. “That is what Vanessa would have wanted.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United. The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

The group all started in 1992 and would have all left by 1998. Joint organiser Lynda Hardman said: “We’ve managed to make contact with a lot of them but some are missing. “It’s been 20 years since we left school and I thought a wee reunion would be a good excuse to get together and have a fun night with good food, friends and some old classic 90s tunes.  “We want a night to reconnect and reminisce.” They are also calling on any teachers of the era who could face meeting up with some of their young charges again. They have booked the Marine Hotel on Saturday, July 28 and ex-pupil and DJ Steven James will spin the decks. Lynda added: “Many people have their tickets already, some who live locally like Vicki Cameron, some from a bit further afield, like Ed and Kim Wood (Carmichael) and others are travelling from outside Scotland like Hannah Izod (Green) who now lives in England, Neil Lockie of Florida and John Brisco in Hong Kong.” Tickets costing \u0026pound25 include three-course meal and welcome drink and can be bought at the website marr92 and Lynda and fellow organiser Mhairi Lammie were on the yearbook committee of the time and are seeking photos for a slide show to be sent to atreunion1992@outlook "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12662348.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/lhr_ayp_010618dom.jpg","title":"prestwick tennis superstar learning disability","story":"NewsPrestwick tennis superstar with learning disability climbed Goat Fell for charityDominic Iannotti, who is number one in the world for his tennis category, made it to the top of the 2867ft peak on Arran.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet14:45, 7 JUN 2018NewsDominic Iannotti Prestwick Tennis player (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRising tennis star Dominic Iannotti made a mountain of cash by climbing Goat Fell. The 20-year-old from Prestwick, who is number one in the world for his tennis category, made it to the top of the 2867ft peak on Arran. Dominic was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, which is on the autism spectrum, at a young age and is part of the Great Britain Learning Disability tennis team. After three years in the sport, he is number one in the world for his doubles category and number three in the world for singles. He competes in the mainstream tennis ranks and is in the top 10 for the South/West Scotland overall. He is currently part of an apprenticeship at Prestwick Tennis Fitness Club and is close to achieving his level three coaching badges that would allow him to coach anywhere in the world. Dominic’s dad, Anthony, who runs the Iannotti Bros cash and carry, could not be more proud of him. The 50-year-old, from Prestwick, said: “Dominic was diagnosed at a young age. We tried all kinds of things but nothing seemed to help. “My wife went online and found children’s charity Bibic and we spoke to them. They were a godsend and they guided us and helped Dominic through a lot.    Since then we haven’t looked back and he has became a fantastic kid.  “You would never know he had this syndrome and that’s credit to the hard work done.” Dominic decided to give something back to the charities that have helped him over the years. He climbed Goat Fell with a group of friends and raised \u0026pound810 for Bibic and South Ayrshire Autistic Society. Anthony said: “We are very proud of him. “A lot of people now do fundraising for national charities but the local ones don’t get as much exposure or sponsors. We wanted to help Bibic as they were instrumental in helping the way Dominic is today and SAAS helped Dominic from a very young age.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"thousands pounds pocketed council after","story":"NewsThousands of pounds pocketed by council after secret VAT grabBut they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston14:18, 6 JUN 2018NewsCouncillor Peter Convery brands move on VAT “sleekit”\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of pounds is being pocketed by a council after a secret VAT grab. But they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure. In February HMRC announced there was to be no VAT on council provided leisure activities. And that will include swimming, gym use and bowling at Northfield. But South Ayrshire Council has not let any of its customers know. If effectively means golf charges have soared 24% on last year, rather than the 2.7% the council have boasted about. It means that golfers paying the \u0026pound429 season ticket price would be expecting a \u0026pound71.50 reduction for VAT.  Tory councillor Peter Convery is blasting the move as “sleekit.” And he said: “Surely people are entitled to get some money paid back to them? “This is about principle and this is sleekit. “This is peoples’ money and should never have been included in the original ticket charge. “It is very unfortunate the council cannot see this to any great extent.” In East Ayrshire, where leisure is provided by an arm’s length trust, VAT is necessary on charges. Details of the VAT grab emerged in an email between a golfer and Councillor Brian McGinley.  The golfer, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “I do not think the majority of season ticket holders will be enamoured to discover that a significant element of their season ticket fee is actually related to a cost that SAC no longer have to bear.” Ayr East councillor McGinley said in the email: “I have ascertained that VAT has been included within the price of a season ticket up until February 18 this year. “Following a court ruling against HMRC whereby sports services provided by local authorities are now classed as exempt for VAT purposes, VAT is no longer remitted to HMRC when income is received for season tickets etc.” A council spokesman would not explain why they had not revealed the VAT windfall, if players can expect a refund or whether is was just being used to mask a huge leap in prices.  He would only say: “We work hard to ensure our golf and leisure provision continues to offer great value for local people and visitors and this is reflected in our current charging structure. “The funding from entry fees and season tickets only makes a partial contribution to our overall operating costs – with the remainder coming directly from Council subsidy – and the 2.7% price increase on last year’s fees reflects the Consumer Price Index. “Reducing inequalities within our communities is a key commitment for the Council and we have extended the concessions available under the Access to Leisure card scheme – which includes a 15% discount for all South Ayrshire residents. The change in VAT application for Council leisure services contributes towards the costs of that important scheme, which will help improve health and wellbeing across South Ayrshire, as well as helping reduce the net deficit cost of running Council leisure services, which was almost \u0026pound11 million in 2016/17.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church help build new","story":"NewsTroon church to help build new school for hurricane victimsThe Troon church has raised £170,000 to help transform people’s lives in Haiti.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:28, 7 JUN 2018NewsPastor Richard Woods with Minister Rolex visiting Muirhead Primary (Image: Copyright unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Building a school for hurricane victims was once a dream for Seagate Church.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"flags fly as putting green opens","story":"There are 18 holes on the seaside green next to the children\u0026#8217s play park and staff also have three play tents, mats for younger children and a small selection of safe toys.South Kintyre Development Trust (SKDT) which manages the attraction has putters to suit all heights and a scorecard is provided.At the end of May SKDT was awarded £75,000 from the Big Lottery Fund (BLF).A BLF press release stated: \u0026#8216This funding will enable the organisation to not only continue but develop their activities at Campbeltown village hall.\u0026#8217At the opening were South Kintyre Development Trust\u0026#8217s Shaun Brown,  putting green staff Tina Chestnut and Peter Lusher with Morag McMillan. 25_c23puttinggreen01Baby Julia Skibinska, 11 months, was happy to play by the putting green. 25_c23puttinggreen02Cate McMillan, 11 months, chewed on some plastic ice cream. 25_c23puttinggreen03\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

Momentum has since picked-up.Last year 30 newcomers were trained to sail dinghies and a new stand-up paddle-boarding (SUP) group was formed local volunteers are now completing their training as SUP instructors.A first ever community regatta is planned for August 4 to open up participation in a range of marine sports.Two community organisations and three local sports clubs \u0026#8211 sailing, kayaking and diving \u0026#8211 have joined the SCIO as corporate members, with the approval of their national governing bodies.Others are likely to follow.\u0026#8216We didn’t start out to break new ground,\u0026#8217 added Mr Fox, \u0026#8216But the feedback we are getting suggests that our approach is both unusual and attractive to funders, because we have combined community- and sports groups in a single, inclusive organisation.\u0026#8216But we still have to make the case, and objective cost/benefit analysis of the options is essential. \u0026#8216The options appraisal will look at potential locations for the proposed new building, taking account of community interest as well as planning and technical issues.Jennifer Nicoll, Argyll and the Islands area manager for HIE, said: \u0026#8216Kintyre Seasports is an ambitious project involving a large scale redevelopment and therefore requires a full options appraisal of possible sites.\u0026#8216I am pleased we are able to support this early stage of the project and look forward to the findings of the appraisal.\u0026#8217Kintyre Seasports Project member and the Kintyre Canoe Club coach, Sid Gallagher, ran an well supported introduction to canoeing session last Saturday.Young canoeists trying out the sport are from left: Riley Suddes, 10, Sean West, 10, Flint-Phoenix Barrett, 10, Bradley Suddes, 12 and coach Sid Gallagher. 25_c23canoeing03Morag McLean and her grand-daughter Hollie McLean, 5, try canoeing. 25_c23canoeing02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"makeover resurrects st kierans hall","story":"The sale of Campbeltown\u0026#8217s Red Cross hall has spurred the refurbishment of St Kieran\u0026#8217s own premises next door.In common with many town charities, St Kieran\u0026#8217s had held its own church coffee mornings in the Red Cross hall which the national charity is attempting to sell.St Kieran\u0026#8217s hall, which has upstairs and downstairs rooms and a serviceable kitchen, was once the town\u0026#8217s Roman Catholic primary school but since closing had fallen into a state of disrepair.Pensioner Archie Wilson, who helped in the six week refurbishment, said: \u0026#8216I remember the classrooms  from those odd occasions when I went to school.\u0026#8217The church\u0026#8217s priest, Father Tony Wood said: \u0026#8216I am very grateful for all the work that has been done and how it has been completed.\u0026#8216The plaster was falling off the walls and the windows were black.

The minimum owners\u0026#8217 contribution for each unit was £5,000. After a lengthy period he sold all of his flats.\u0026#8216Council officers, due to their breadth of experience of historic building repair, have gone way beyond their nominal roles to help the association and stop the project falling to pieces.\u0026#8217HES approved the council’s CARS bid in January 2015.  During the next three years, the association came up with £101,000 between them.The association was awarded a CARS grant of £383,000, which included £306,000 from HES and a private sector housing grant £141,000 making a total project value of £625,000.A council spokesperson said: \u0026#8216CARS money was ring-fenced for the scheme but had to be committed by March 2018.\u0026#8217Shortly after the cash was guaranteed,  the association appointed  a firm of Glasgow conservation architects, ZM Architecture Ltd., to lead a consultation team to scope, survey and cost the scheme.The repair project has three parts: high level repairs including roofing, leadwork and rainwater goods, extensive stone repairs and the replacement of the rear walkways and failing amenity deck.A council spokesperson added: \u0026#8216Although the building is not covered by statutory listing it is considered of historical importance and occupies a key location in the town centre.\u0026#8217After 12 months of development work the works were put out to tender and five quotes were obtained.Glasgow conservation specialists John Fulton  (Plumbers) Ltd was appointed. The firm is expected to use a number of Kintyre sub-contractors.An incident in July 2015, when a teenager narrowly escaped death, illustrated the urgent need for repairs.The 12-year-old boy fell, about 20 feet into the shop below through the rotten decking skylight, while taking part in the latest craze \u0026#8211 free running \u0026#8211 popularised in films such as Casino Royale.For more on the regeneration of Campbeltown see an Argyll and Bute Council feature on pages 14 and 15.George McMillan looks into the hole in his roof in 2015. 25_c30roof01The timber rooflight structure, on the leaky deck, after the 2015 incident.  25_c30roof03Scaffolding is erected at 22 to 30 Main Street.  NO_c23cars10_scaffold_erectionLast week scaffolding was erected through the deck area.  NO_c23cars11_scaffold_through_deckThe full deck area.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

Rockers Altered Sky are fulfilling their ambition of playing at Download Festival, Britain\u0026rsquos premier hard rock and heavy metal festival, on Thursday, June 7, with plans for a UK summer tour also set to be announced in the coming weeks.  The band, which includes Haddington\u0026rsquos Ana Nowosielska and Amy Blair, will be the main support in the Doghouse Tent, with the gig taking place the day before the main festival gets under way.  Ana, the band\u0026rsquos lead singer, was excited \u0026ldquobeyond words ahead of the festival, which is celebrating its 16th year.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is up there with a childhood dream.  \u0026ldquoYou would go to Download and see Slipknot and Metallica and we are going to be playing there as well.  \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely amazing.  The band is looking at hiring a van and staying for the four-day festival at Donington Park, which this year is headlined by Avenged Sevenfold, Guns N\u0026rsquo Roses and Ozzy Osbourne.  Ana added: \u0026ldquoDownload is definitely one of our goals.  \u0026ldquoIt is one of the biggest music festivals in the UK, especially for our type of music.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much suited to where we want to be.  Currently the band\u0026rsquos attention is focused on creating their second album, the follow-up to Without Wonderland.  The five-piece will soon head down to Wales to record the album, with a view to it being released in the New Year.  Ana, 28, said: \u0026ldquoEverything has been a lot easier this time.  \u0026ldquoWe were joking the other day and saying we had a good five years to write the first album and now we have had six months to write the second album.  \u0026ldquoThe difference is we are definitely going to see that the album is going to stand by itself.  The band are then hoping to get back on the open road, with a UK tour being organised and the band keen to venture further afield again.  Last autumn, the band enjoyed a 19-date tour which saw them performing in the Philippines and Japan.  Ana told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously talking about going back to Asia again. We met so many good people and made so many wonderful relationships.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to tour Europe \u0026ndash hit up Germany and we had an Italian tour in the works a year ago which fell through.  \u0026ldquoThen, of course, we would like to get over to the USA.  Ana grew up on Haddington\u0026rsquos Alderston Meadow and met drummer Amy, who lived on the town\u0026rsquos Long Cram and attended Knox Academy, during a night out in the town\u0026rsquos Mercat Hotel.  The band is completed by Ross Archibald, Ryan Zdrojewski and Tara Behran.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":null,"title":"LOOKING BACK  Remembering the first ever Haddington Festival","story":"              HADDINGTON Festival is celebrating its golden anniversary at the moment, with the event having put a smile on thousands of faces since 1968.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.  His colleague Martin Whitfield MP said it was \u0026ldquoyet more evidence of the detrimental impact Universal Credit was having on vulnerable local families.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.

John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.

On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.

Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Caroline Brown, acting depute headteacher at the Grammar, said that the relationship between the school and the VisitScotland five-star racecourse was proving fruitful for both pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis kind of real-life insight into the world of work and the wider hospitality and tourism sector is extremely helpful in giving students the experience and information which will help them decide on a career path they could potentially follow on leaving school.  \u0026ldquoAccess to the racecourse facilities and to experienced industry professionals who can share valuable insights is a real bonus and we are delighted that Musselburgh Racecourse was willing to work with us in supporting our young students as they prepare to transition from education to the working world."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7896063.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Israelis and Palestinians gear up for fresh confrontation","story":"              Israelis and Palestinians are gearing up for another mass demonstration along the fence with Gaza.

Andrew Yorkston parked his vehicle in a lay-by near to Drummohr Holiday Park and left the two youngsters in the back seat of the locked car for about 30 minutes on a hot summer\u0027s day.  The six-year-old girl and two-year-old boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl banging on the car windows and screaming: \u0026ldquoHelp, save us.  The worried passers-by contacted the police and waited by the car to calm the kids before Yorkston eventually appeared, claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been [away] five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 27-year-old then drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  On Tuesday, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Yorkston was in charge of the children when he was taking them to a nearby McDonald\u0027s and stopped off unexpectedly at the lay-by near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane told the court that the two-year-old boy and the six-year-old girl were spotted locked in the car at about 5.30pm.  Mr Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who were very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe six-year-old was shouting: \u0026lsquoHelp, save us.\u0026rsquo  The girl pointed to an opening in the trees and told the passers-by that the man looking after her was down there, the court heard.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, said that Yorkston, of North Grange Avenue, had stopped for a toilet break and his wife had been left \u0026ldquosuitably unimpressed by his actions.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  The solicitor added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0027s and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme.  \u0026ldquoFortunately there was no harm down to the children.  Sheriff Adrian Cottam deferred sentence to next month.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7806713.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"WHO admits mistaking Prestonpans for Preston on official pollution figures","story":"              THE World Health Organisation (WHO) has removed Prestonpans from its list of most polluted communities. . . after confirming that it had confused the East Lothian town with the English city of Preston!  There was widespread concern when the global monitor named Prestonpans as Scotland\u0026rsquos most polluted town in its latest breakdown of pollution figures earlier this month.  The annual list used readings taken from 2013 and named Prestonpans as the worst offender in Scotland.  WHO released a similar report two years ago which also named and shamed Prestonpans \u0026ndash yet it was thought then that the reported high pollution levels in the town related to the former Cockenzie Power Station, which had been operational until March 2013.  However, East Lothian Council told the Courier earlier this month that it believed the reading was actually down to a geographical error by WHO, claiming that the organisation had confused Prestonpans with Preston in Lancashire, nearly 200 miles away.  And this week, the WHO confirmed that this was indeed the case.  In an email to senior environmental health officials at the local authority, representatives of WHO confirmed that they had confused the two communities due to a computer mapping error.  They said: \u0026ldquoIt is true that there was a mislabel in the datum for Prestonpans, which should have been labelled as Preston.  \u0026ldquoThis error originated in the previous database release when reverse geocoding the coordinates from the EEA (European Economic Area).

Offering golfers the chance to improve their\u0026nbsphandicap whilst taking in the wonderful scenery, you\u0027re\u0026nbspspoiled for choice when choosing where to play. Taking out some of the hard work, here we bring five fantastic golf courses to try out this summer.  Balmore Golf Club  Balmore Golf Club, set in the secluded rolling countryside of East Dunbartonshire\u0026nbspbetween Milngavie and Bishopbriggs, is probably the finest inland Scottish golf course you have yet to play. Central Scotland is blessed with many great courses, but they don\u0027t come any better than Balmore. A bold claim, but the club\u0026nbspare confident that once you play the perfectly manicured 18 holes designed by six-time British Open Champion Harry Vardon, you will agree\u0026nbsp- and be happy to tell others the same.    Founded in 1907, Balmore Golf Club has a proud history, but it has an even brighter future. Significant investments in facilities for the whole family such as a 6-hole Par 3 course with complimentary child membership and an extensive practice facility for keen golfers eager to perfect their game has uniquely positioned the club. It\u0027s a safe, family-friendly environment successfully attracting a new generation of members such as former Celtic and Scotland football star Kris Commons who joined during April\u0027s new member intake:  \"I\u0026rsquove played a lot of great golf courses in Scotland over the years,\" said Kris. \"But I decided to join Balmore Golf Club for two main reasons: the quality of the course itself, plus the stand-out practice facilities which are set up to cater to families. The real clincher was the massive practice area which has two full size greens with bunkers, a six-hole par 3 course, putting green and driving range. My two boys are really keen on golf, so having such an impressive practice facility that they can use to learn and enjoy the game is important. If you haven\u0026rsquot played Balmore yet, then I strongly recommend you give it a try \u0026ndash you won\u0026rsquot be disappointed.    Visit soon to judge for yourself!

The club are proud to be one of the best rated golf courses in the West of Scotland.

The historic ruins of Buchanan Castle overlook the course and there are many references to the Graham family within the well-appointed clubhouse.  Rob Roy McGregor walked the estate in the past so visitors and members are truly walking in the footsteps of legends.

It\u0027s a joy to play and most of the time very quiet, allowing the visitor to relish the ups and downs of the fairways and the tussle with undulating greens. The arresting views across to the islands of Islay, Jura and Gigha provide a delightful backdrop on an idyllic summer\u0027s day with the firm Machrihanish turf underfoot, the majesty of the dunes and wheeling seabirds providing the musical sound track.  To provide a varied test for the competent golfer, the layout is not just a predictable nine out and nine back. The classic links holes, apart from the 1st, are the 5th, another par four with its fairway like an elephant\u0027s graveyard, the 10th, a clever dogleg par five and the 15th, a \"one shotter\" with real difficulty if the elusive green is missed from the tee. Members can also enjoy complimentary use of the practise and putting areas.    The course ranks highly on a global scale. Golf Digest rated Machrihanish among the top 100 courses in the world in 2018, climbing 30 places to now rank 61st in the world. The club is also rated fourth best value for money within the UK.

A poll of deputy heads and principal teachers found nearly two thirds either \u0026ldquodisagreed or \u0026ldquostrongly disagreed when asked whether they wanted to become a headteacher - up from some 50 per cent last year.  The Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland (AHDS), which conducted the survey, said the findings highlighted a \u0026ldquosignificant leaning towards uncertainty about seeking headship roles.  The same survey went on to highlight the main concerns of headteachers as being workload, bureaucracy and lack of teaching and support staff.  On average headteachers said they were working more than 55 hours a week - twenty more hours than they are contracted for.  Read more: Schools struggle to recruit headteachers  Members of the union who submitted written responses identified a range of concerns with one stating: \u0026ldquoI have the headship qualification, but do not want the stress of headship.  Another said: \u0026ldquoI cannot see how I could become a headteacher without it being detrimental to my own family life.  One headteacher who had been in the post for a decade said they had stepped down due to family circumstances citing a lack of work life balance.  The survey comes as the Scottish Government prepares to give more powers to headteachers under a new Education Bill.  Read more: Rushing Headteachers\u0027 Charter could be \u0027disastrous\u0027  The legislation will usher in a new Headteachers\u0026rsquo Charter which will enable heads to shape the curriculum, decide on how funding is allocated and select staff.  The rationale is a concern that decision-making by councils can be divorced from what is required at school level.  However, critics argue the proposals will increase school bureaucracy and make headteachers a lightening rod for any criticisms and concerns about standards making the job even more stressful.  Greg Dempster, general secretary of the AHDS, said international research proved how important high quality school leadership was.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat our survey tells us very clearly is that, due to a lack of resources or an excess of expectations, our school leaders are finding themselves diverted into front line roles or back-room bureaucracy.  \u0026ldquoThat prevents them from getting to the core of the leadership role of engaging with pupils, parents and staff in pursuit of school improvement.  \u0026ldquoThe current situation is putting many high quality candidates off headship, so the already poor recruitment position continues to worsen.  Mr Dempster said there were obvious implications for the introduction of the Headteachers\u0026rsquo Charter.  He added: \u0026ldquoSchool leaders are clearly struggling to deliver in their current roles and the government must take that reality seriously when considering how to progress and resource changes to the roles and responsibilities of school leaders.  Read more: Why Headteachers\u0027 Charter must be piloted first  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent body Connect, said members were increasingly highlighting concerns over the recruitment of heads.  She said: \u0026ldquoParent councils tell us they have been part of selection panels over two or more rounds of recruitment, with posts being re-advertised even in city schools where the pool of candidates should be bigger.  \u0026ldquoThe advent of the Headteacher\u0026rsquos Charter and the expectations this will place on headteachers is another factor.  \u0026ldquoWithout doubt school leaders are being expected to step up to a very demanding role which is critical in setting the right ethos and values in a school, for the good of children and their future."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/4157495.jpg?type=article-full","title":"First Minister has  no plans  to meet DUP leader during Scots Orange Order visit","story":"              First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she does not plan to meet Arlene Foster when the DUP leader attends an Orange Order parade in Fife later this month.

After weeks of internal negotiations and even suggestions of a threatened resignation from David Davis, Theresa May finally got agreement with her Cabinet\u0026rsquos leading Brexiteers.  This followed three separate early morning meetings in her Commons office with Mr Davis and his colleagues Boris Johnson and Liam Fox, which were described as \u0026ldquoconstructive. No 10 made clear none of them had threatened to resign.  Asked if the Prime Minister was confident Brussels would accept the \u0026ldquofudged back-stop plan, her deputy spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoI wouldn\u0026rsquot recognise that word but it\u0026rsquos important to say the EU put forward their proposal and we were clear\u0026hellipthat was unacceptable this is our counter-proposal. We look forward to discussing it further with the EU.  As the so-called Brexit War Cabinet later met in Downing Street, before Mrs May jetted off for the G7 summit in Canada, the Government published its technical note on its back-stop plan.  This is the time-limit, which Mr Davis had wanted inserted its omission in the draft had angered the Secretary of State, raising speculation he might quit.  A source close to the Secretary of State explained: \"The back-stop paper has been amended and now expresses, in much more detail, the time-limited nature of our proposal something the PM and David Davis have always been committed to.\"  However, political opponents seized on the key lines in the document, pointing out how it was not a guaranteed back-stop at all and it referred only to how the UK Government \u0026ldquoexpects the preferred customs option to be in place by December 2021 33 months from the start of Brexit in March 2019.  The Government believes it will never need the back-stop plan - the legal guarantee to maintain frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic \u0026ndash as it is confident of coming up with its preferred customs option post-Brexit.  The European Commission says both options are unworkable.  No 10 was unable to give any clear indication as to how the internal consideration of the two options was going or whether or not Mrs May and her colleagues were any nearer to choosing one or the other.  At Westminster, Labour\u0026rsquos Chris Leslie was dismissive, saying: \"After weeks of the Government negotiating with itself, the fudged document they have produced doesn\u0027t engage with any of the key Brexit dilemmas and is highly unlikely to lead to anything but more gridlock in the ongoing talks with the EU.\"  His party colleague Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, said Mrs May had \"signed up to a flawed proposal, which is inconsistent with her earlier commitments\".  He added: \u0026ldquoThe PM should urgently rethink her decision and back Labour\u0026rsquos call for a new comprehensive customs union and new deal with the single market after Brexit.  In Brussels, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u0027s Brexit co-ordinator, was downbeat.  Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, also took to social media to welcome the Government\u0026rsquos back-stop plan but said there were three questions: \u0026ldquoIs it a workable solution to avoid a hard border?

The rivalry has historically also made it onto record.  Andy Cameron\u0027s Ally\u0027s Tartan Army World Cup song in 1978 contained the famous line: \"We\u0027re representing Britain we\u0027ve got to do or die, for England cannae dae it \u0027cause they didnae qualify.\"  England won their final World Cup warm up game, beating Costa Rica 2-0 in Leeds      #anyonebutengland Well played The Commercial Wishaw \u0026#128513\u0026#128077\u0026#127995 pic.twitter/U12zd6p8v6      It\u0027s the Commercial in Wishaw.

But now it appears that House of Fraser\u0026rsquos best days are behind it following an announcement that it is to close more than half of its stores, including its Edinburgh shop on Princes Street and its Oxford Street store in London, with the loss of 6,000 jobs UK-wide.  The chain said the planned closures are vital to secure the future of the brand, which began life in Glasgow in 1849.  And while House of Fraser has endured turbulent times in the past, experts say the threat of administration is still looming if the rescue plan does not succeed.  The chain is one of a number of former giants of the high street which have struggled to cope with changing consumer habits, the rise of the internet and the high cost of running \u0026ldquobricks and mortar stores.  The decision to shut stores comes as part of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) \u0026ndash a controversial insolvency procedure in vogue among struggling retailers. If the CVA is approved by landlords, it will affect up to 2,000 House of Fraser staff and a further 4,000 across brands and concessions.  The group said it also has plans to relocate its Baker Street head office and the Granite House office in Glasgow to help slash costs and \u0026ldquosecure House of Fraser\u0026rsquos future, although its flagship Buchanan Street shop will stay open.  Frank Slevin, chairman of House of Fraser, said: \u0026ldquoOur legacy store estate has created an unsustainable cost base, which without restructuring, presents an existential threat to the business.  \u0026ldquoSo whilst closing stores is a very difficult decision, especially given the length of relationship House of Fraser has with all its locations, there should be no doubt that it is absolutely necessary if we are to continue to trade and be competitive.  House of Fraser is one of the oldest chains in the UK, with a history stretching back almost 200 years to a single shop in Glasgow.  It began life when James Arthur and Hugh Fraser opened a drapery and haberdashery business on the corner of Buchanan Street which would eventually move into the lavish building which occupies the site today.  But it was under Hugh Fraser\u0026rsquos grandson, Hugh Fraser III, that the chain really took off. Inheriting the business at the age of 21, Hugh, later Lord Fraser of Allander, began expanding by buying regional store groups Arnott \u0026amp Co and Robert Simpson \u0026amp Sons.  On his death in 1966, his son, also called Hugh, continued growing the business beyond its humble roots, buying out more than 50 companies.  However, his time in charge came to an end in the 1970s when he was engulfed by an insider trading scandal, said to have been fuelled by his gambling addiction.  House of Fraser then passed through several hands, and now Hamleys owner, the Chinese firm C.banner, is being lined up to buy a 51 per cent stake in House of Fraser and invest \u0026pound70 million into what remains of the business.  But its cash injection is pledged only on the condition the retailer can agree the CVA restructuring.  Will Wright, a restructuring partner at KPMG, which is handling the CVA, warned of dire consequences if that does not go ahead.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business has been impacted by the mounting pressures facing the UK high street, with the declining profitability of certain stores exacerbated by costly legacy leases which were originally negotiated many years ago. With trading conditions unlikely to materially improve in the short term, the future of House of Fraser is at significant risk unless steps to restructure the business both financially and operationally are taken.  Leigh Sparks, Deputy Principal and Professor of Retail Studies at the Institute for Retail Studies, University of Stirling, said that House of Fraser was one of a number of chains struggling to stay relevant in the modern age.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere are other department stores which have gone by the wayside and it is a format which is not as popular with customers as it used to be.  \u0026ldquoMany of the products department stores sell can now be found in other shops on the high street for online for cheaper, and they are just not the draw they used to be.  \u0026ldquoThere are flagship department stores, such as Harrods and Selfridges, where the footfall is still enough to sustain them but House of Fraser is not in that bracket.  David Lonsdale, Director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, added: \u0026ldquoThis is further evidence of how the retail industry is going through a period of profound transformation driven by changes in shopping habits, weak growth in wages, and rising public policy induced costs. This is upending many retail business models, and that can be painful for the firms involved and for their staff.  \u0026ldquoThe industry is in the midst of a hugely challenging period and retailers are adapting and trying to reinvent themselves. What is clear is that the retail industry will look very different in the future. This will have implications for public policy, particularly for employment prospects in communities more reliant on retail jobs, for our town centres and for future revenues from taxes on property."},{"url":null,"title":"Happy birthday for Mackintosh with first glimpse of tea rooms restoration","story":"              FROM the moment you walk through the door, the touch of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest architect, designer and artist is everywhere.  Every high-backed chair is precisely lacquered, each window handle and umbrella stand a work of art in itself. On the tables, cucumber sandwiches, crisp white napkins and Willow-patterned cups and saucers hark back to a more elegant age. Welcome to afternoon tea Charles Rennie Mackintosh style.  Yesterday was the Glasgow-born artist\u0026rsquos 150th birthday and it marked a double celebration as guests including the city\u0026rsquos Lord Provost Eva Bolander were given a sneak preview of the stunning restoration and recreation of one of his greatest works.  Four years after an ambitious plan was created to bring the original Willow Tea Rooms Building in Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, back to its former glory, the scale and success of the project was revealed. Hundreds of craftspeople from as far afield as Chicago, Hong Kong, Cumbria and Kirkcaldy have worked to meticulously restore and recreate Mackintosh\u0026rsquos original vision. And it is magnificent.  Mackintosh at the Willow as it will be known (the Willow Tea Rooms name is owned by Anne Mulhern, who runs another cafe just yards away) won\u0026rsquot open to the public till 02 July. But it is worth the wait.  As well as a 200-seat tearoom and restaurant, a place to discover and rediscover the work of Mackintosh, there will be a visitor\u0026rsquos centre as well as exhibition, retail, conference and education space, creating a cultural and community hub. Elements of the site will open throughout the summer.  The Willow Tea Room Trust, which conceived and co-ordinated the \u0026pound10m renovation, hopes to welcome at least 360,000 visitors a year, providing a boost to tourism in a part of the city centre that has declined in recent years, not least after the recent fire on Sauchiehall Street.  Conceived as a a social enterprise, it already provides training and work for 40 staff, many of them young people involved in the Princes Trust charity. The Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society will also have a base at the site.  The original Willow Tea Rooms, opened in October 1903, was one of a series commissioned by Glasgow entrepreneur Miss Catherine Cranston, and the only one created by Mackintosh \u0026ndash her partner in design - in its entirety, from the architecture of the building to the furniture and cutlery. It also featured stunning panels by Mackintosh\u0026rsquos wife, the designer Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh and is recognised as one of the finest complete Art Nouveau schemes in the world.  The expert team behind the renovation project worked mainly from black and white photographs contained in an art periodical to get every aspect of the interior detail right. And the woman behind the transformation is delighted with the result.  \u0026ldquoThis is such a happy day, said Celia Sinclair, chair of the Trust. \u0026ldquoThis is a landmark heritage restoration and re-creation that is all about engaging the next generation of artists, designers and entrepreneurs. It\u0026rsquos also about instilling civic pride in Glasgow folk.  \u0026ldquoI hope Mackintosh and Miss Cranston would be pleased by what we have done, and I rather suspect they would love what we are trying to achieve.  \u0026ldquoMackintosh was neglected by his fellow Scots during his own time and I was amazed by the lack of interest when I originally approached various organisations over this project. But four years on this is an exciting new beginning. Toshie, your day has come.  Pamela Robertson, Professor Emerita of Mackintosh Studies at the University of Glasgow, a member of the expert panel who oversaw the renovation, described the day as a \u0026ldquomilestone in the history of the building.  She added: \u0026ldquoThis was a journey of discovery for all of us. The Willow was undoubtedly Mackintosh\u0026rsquos finest commission for Miss Cranston and has been extremely challenging for us to reinstate. But the analysis of the photographs has allowed us to re-engage with the textures and forms of this stunning design, to really see what Mackintosh envisioned."},{"url":null,"title":"SNP support on increase  poll finds","story":"              Support for the SNP has increased to 40% and could see the party pick up another eight seats at Westminster, according to a new poll.  The YouGov survey for The Times Scotland found the Scottish Conservatives have retaken second place on 27% - up 4% from the last poll - while Labour have dropped 5% to 23% in Westminster voting intentions.  Despite the SNP and Tories both growing in support by 4% since January, a seat projection from the poll gave the SNP 43 MPs - up from the current 35 - but saw the Tories drop two seats to 11.  Labour would lose six seats and be left with just one MP, according to the poll of more than 1,000 Scots carried out at the start of June.  However, a similar seat projection on the proportional system Scottish Parliament would see the SNP lose nine seats despite an increase in voting intentions for the party.  The projection would see the Greens pick up three seats and Labour, Lib Dems and Tories pick up two each.  Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: \"This is an extraordinary endorsement of our record in government, with people continuing to put their trust in the SNP to deliver for Scotland.  \"But it also shows that we\u0027re winning the argument over Scotland\u0027s future - how best we keep driving our country forward, delivering the best public services anywhere in the UK and building a fairer country.  \"Our vision to create a successful economy and flourishing, inclusive society could not be further at odds with despair and chaos of Brexit from the Tories.  \"But these figures will make dismal reading for Labour. They\u0027ve got no credibility on the serious issues we face as a country, Richard Leonard is a struggling leader and that\u0027s why they\u0027re plummeting in the polls.\"  The poll found Mr Leonard\u0027s approval rating was -20 while UK party leader Jeremy Corbyn has an overall -30 rating among Scottish voters surveyed.  Ruth Davidson was the only senior politician with a postive rating at 11. Theresa May scored lowest at -44 with Nicola Sturgeon on -2.  The poll recorded no change in support for independence from the 45% in the 2014 referendum.  Support for a referendum in the next five years stood at 40%, with 52% against and 8% unsure."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7896810.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Storm in a teacake  Mystery   235 000 Rolls-Royce Tory donor revealed as Tunnock s tycoon","story":"              SNP-run Glasgow City Council accepted a \u0026pound235,000 Rolls Royce Ghost from a Tory donor who supported the No campaign in 2014, it has emerged.  Boyd Tunnock, whose family firm makes some of Scotland\u0026rsquos most famous biscuits, gifted the car to the city for the use of Lord Provost Eva Bolander.  When the council announced receipt of the car earlier this week it caused an outcry, after the authrority refused to name the donor, saying he wished to remain anonymous.    The Labour party also said it was \u0026ldquoDickensian for the civic head of a council making public service cuts to be chauffeured around the city in a luxury car.  The identity of Mr Tunnock is also awkward for the SNP administration.  In 2014, he was a prominent opponent of independence, posing with Tory leader Ruth Davidson at his Uddingston plant with dozens of teacakes spelling out the word No.  \u0026ldquoPersonally, I think the best choice in every respect is to say No, he was quoted saying in a Scottish Conservative press release.  Electoral Commission records also show he gave \u0026pound10,000 to the UK Conservatives in 2016 and a further \u0026pound20,000 in 2017.  Despite Labour criticism of the gift, it is understood the car donation was facilitated by a Labour councillor, John Kane.  A source confirmed Mr Tunnock, 85, was the donor.

Palestinian protesters have burnt tyres near the border as Israeli soldiers took position.  Israeli firefighters are on stand-by to battle fires caused by kites rigged with burning rags launched by Palestinians which have damaged forests and crops in past protests.  More than 115 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire during near-weekly demonstrations that began on March 30.  Protests led by the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza are fuelled by frustration over a decade-old Israel-Egyptian blockade, imposed after Hamas seized control there.  Israel is bracing for a large turnout as the protest coincides with \u0026ldquoJerusalem Day, which its arch-enemy Iran established to coincide with the last Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan to express support for the Palestinians.  Meanwhile, in the Syrian capital Damascus, scores of Syrians and Palestinians commemorated Jerusalem Day by marching through the streets and chanting anti-Israel slogans.  The men and women marched from the Hamidyeh market in the old city of Damascus to the Umayyad Mosque and waved the Syrian and Palestinian flags.  Hamid Hassan, 73, a Palestinian, said that the Jerusalem Day \u0026ldquomeans a lot for us. Jerusalem is an Arab land and it\u0026rsquos the land of all religions.
