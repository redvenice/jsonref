They are bodies you don’t often see in magazines or on social media’Several years ago, when I was back home in Lithuania, I went to the beach for the first time in years. I grabbed my longboard, gathered a group of friends and family, and headed for one of the most popular spots on the Baltic coast.On this beach, there is a bridge that overlooks the shore. As I walked across it, I could see all of the bathers lying beneath me on the sand. I had a perfect bird’s eye view. I had never seen the beach from that angle, and it was fascinating. That evening, I began the research for this series, Comfort Zone. I looked through reams of beach photography, but pretty much none of the images had captured the scene from above. I found nothing documenting it from this angle in this clean, simple, almost clinical way.I wanted to create a typology of beach culture – a kind of study of the phenomenon as if I were investigating a different species. I was thinking about what it would be like to come to Earth as an alien and witness this: what sense would you make of it?As well as my camera, I used equipment to help me to shoot from above while I was moving around at beach level: a four-metre-long pole with an attachment for my camera, and a radio trigger for when I was ready to shoot.It was important that the photos were perfectly candid, so I didn’t tell anyone I was shooting them. But people were looking at me. I realised that the people who weren’t looking at me must be sleeping, so I knew which ones I wanted to photograph.I tried to avoid any conversations or arouse suspicion. I wasn’t doing anything against the law, but the beach is a place where people sometimes don’t feel comfortable being shot. Some people did approach me though – you can imagine seeing the same person every day walking with this strange thing on his shoulders, so they asked me what I was doing. I said I was just taking photos of nature, and if they were persistent with their questions, I would show them images I had taken of the sea or the forest.When those images started to be published, there were some concerns, and people questioned my practice. My view is that I’ve never focused on someone’s personal life: my work is about society, community, humanity – it’s not about one particular person.I took this shot on the first day I started to work on the series. It was nerve-racking: I had no idea how the pictures were going to look and I didn’t know how people would respond to me. That evening at home, I looked through the day’s work. Nothing was right apart from this shot. This image convinced me that the whole project was worth pursuing. For that reason alone, it’s special to me.The image tells a story: you can see the very shade of the woman’s lipstick, you can see the veins in her legs, but despite the specificity of the shot, it’s also oddly surreal. There’s a kind of dissonance in it that appeals to me.As in the rest of the series, the bodies you see are real. They are bodies you don’t often see in magazines, online or on social media. Every day we are bombarded with images of people eating perfectly healthy food and being perfectly in shape, and so many people feel excluded by that. The reality we are so often presented with is utterly distorted and represents the minority of us.I don’t consider the beach as a utopian escape from the city, but it does illustrate how our behaviour is conditioned by social norms beyond our control. Why is it acceptable to be half naked on a beach, but not in a library? Why does our environment dictate what we can and cannot wear? It’s because our behaviour is always being shaped by people around us.In the age of social media, we are obsessed with the concept of iniduality and the idea that we must all be different all of the time. These images show that, on some level, we just do what everyone else does. The inidual is much less important than the collective or the whole.I travelled to other beaches across the world, thinking it would be interesting to document how beach culture differs. What I found is that it doesn’t. We buy the same things, we often read the same things translated into whatever language we speak and we use the same brands a lot of the time. You can see globalisation in action on the beach, and how consumerism shapes all of our lives. But you can also see a kind of commonality, the similarities between us, no matter where in the world we are.Studied: MA in Architecture at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University.Influences: “Everything I have seen and experienced has impacted me.

While a used Volvo FL6 box truck might cost a buyer somewhere in the low thousands of pounds, this one is estimated at between £1m-1.5m.Ralph Taylor, Bonhams head of postwar and contemporary art, said he was thrilled to have the work in the sale.“Banksy is arguably the most important artist to have emerged since the millennium and this, his largest commercial work, represents a new high watermark of quality for works of his to appear at auction,” Taylor said.“The composition bears all the hallmarks of this peerless agent provocateur.”The artist was at an open-air party in Spain to celebrate the millennium when he was presented with the truck by Mojo, the co-founder of Turbozone International Circus.He started on the truck during the party and continued to work on it for a fortnight. It was then used, for years, as the company’s transport around Europe and as far away as South America.The truck is called Turbo Zone Truck (Laugh Now But One Day We’ll Be in Charge). It is funny and anarchic and has flying monkeys, soldiers running away from a cannon and a man about to smash a TV screen with a hammer.Bonhams said the over-riding message of the piece was anarchy – “it’s us against them and we’re going to win.”.It will be sold by the auction house on the Goodwood estate in West Sussex, the ancestral home of the Duke of Richmond, founder of the Goodwood Festival of Speed and the Goodwood Revival.One of the more traditional highlights of the 14 September sale is an ultra-rare 935 Bugatti Type 57 Atalante Faux Cabriolet. It also has an estimate of £1m-1.5m.Three years ago Bonhams sold a Banksy Swat van which he created for his break out Barely Legal show in Los Angeles.

For me, it is a kind of fundamentalism: a drawing should be colourless.But Lisboa has never a city in aquatint.There is something dazzling in her light that requires brighter media. The wide estuary in the south, multiple buildings dressed in azulejos (bright ceramic tiles), and dazzling white stone pavements that mirror an intense extra light, illuminating even the darker shadows.But over the past 10 years, this bright, beautiful city has attracted worldwide interest – and tourism has increased exponentially. In 2018, 29 million people passed through Lisbon airport alone Lisboa city has a population of just 500,000.Nowadays, the tourism trend is to pretend to live in a place as locals. Visitors rent apartments neatly furnished, conveniently placed in upper floors showing oblique stunning views of rooftops and a triangle of blue river, close to a small supermarket and a “neighbourhood” restaurant – everything one needs to feel at home.I welcome these tourists pushing their strollers, spoon stirring their €0.65 bica (espresso coffee) or supermarket shopping as though they are staying for a month. I wish they would stay: we need inhabitants more than we need transient tenants.Today, despite being surrounded by quite a number of Airbnb apartments, Jardim das Amoreiras is still a quiet, almost unknown Eden on the fringes of the old 19th century town. The tourists who stay here, like the silk, combs, and ceramics once produced in the buildings around the square, descend every morning to the city centre, waiting to be shipped back to their original places.On one of the square’s sides, a giant aqueduct built in the 1740s ends in the first great reservoir of the water distribution system. Mãe de Água (Mother of Water) provided reliable water for all the factories’ needs.Most of the apartment buildings in the area were built in the 1930s as part of the modern urban transformation when the industrial centres had already moved to the eastern part of the city and the south river bank. Twenty years ago it was possible for a middle class family to buy an apartment here. Since then, the prices have more than quadrupled in the area (the most rapid price increase has happened in the past five years). Short term rental companies buy apartments or entice owners to let theirs out. More and more homes are passing out of the normal long term renting market.Early each morning I pass by Mãe de Água. Its purpose was to contain water but, for some glorious reason, they decided to give it architectural significance. From the outside, it looks very plain (itself a miracle during those rococo years) but inside it is breathtaking. I teach at a design school, which since 1996 has been based in a building built on the site of the old Santos dock. So every day, I roll down São Bento street just like a crate of combs did in 1780.Between Amoreiras and Santos, near Amália Rodrigues Museum, is the 100-year-old swimming club, Clube Nacional de Natação, where I swim daily. The club used to have an open air swimming pool, which was the only place to swim in the old city centre from 1930s to the 2000s, but it is now covered by padel courts (a strange imprisoned tennis that apparently only Spaniards and Portuguese play). The prime minister’s official residence is nearby, and legend has it that Salazar, Portugal’s dictator between 1936 and 1968, was often annoyed by the joyful screams of children playing in the water.The school where I teach was originally in a palace in Chiado, very close to Largo de Camões. The palace has had several tenants, the most famous of whom was General Junot, who conquered Portugal on behalf of Napoleon in the first French invasion. From the main balcony in the palace he could see the Cais do Sodré docks, from where the royal family fled to Brazil escorted by British warships. Junot stayed only until August 1808 when his army was defeated. Later, bored in Paris, Madame Junot complained in her writings that she missed Lisbon’s light and delicious fruit.We used to hold life drawing classes in a room called “Sala Romana” where the battles between the Romans and the Sabines are frescoed on the walls. The frescoes were finished in 1822, and the artist depicted himself at the age of 25. In 1878 he restored his own paintings and, despite having the option to update his image, chose to keep it as it was 56 years earlier.The school left the building in 2013. These days, the rooms where once Madame Junot rejoiced in the taste of a succulent peach and so many generations of students struggled with art history and human anatomy are a gourmet restaurant.The school’s new building is in the buzzing Santos area – a former industrial area that until the school moved in was run down and seedy. In 1979, the building where the school now functions was built, designed by a famous preposterous-modernist architect Tomás Taveira, emulating the steel language of cranes and port facilities. For almost 20 years, it stayed empty and unsellable. When it was acquired in 1996, little by little the surroundings changed, pushed by nearly 1,800 students and 200 faculty staff who come and go daily every academic year. Now it is a trendy area also populated by other art and design schools, the headquarters of a major power company, plus stylish law-firms and tech companies.This is now a place of “food projects”, regional or political, from France to Mexico to Thailand. One of my favourites is a pizzeria owned by a young Italian couple who, like many, coasted here because of surf and a sort of Californian flair. These restaurants thrive on the hesitations of tourists regarding polvo à lagareiro, alheiras, bacalhau à gomes de sá, bitoques and other enigmatic Portuguese menu items, offering the reassurance of universal pizza, French cuisine and burgers.Our life drawing classes also take us out and about in the city. For perspective and landscape, we work in Centro Cultural de Belém – CCB. It is a place with an intense cultural program, auditoriums, several conference rooms, art galleries and lots of fancy commerce. Museum Berardo, also lodged here, holds a remarkable collection of modern art. The building is a compound with streets and squares dominated by a strict modularity and orthogonal organisation making it perfect for understanding perspective.Inside the CCB compound is the appealing Jardim das Oliveiras, a platform garden terrace facing the river. From there we work on capturing landscape, painfully creating a 360-degree panorama composed of eight drawings.Further to the west, close to the final stop of the speedy tram number 15 that swallows and regurgitates crowds of tourists, we find Aquário Vasco da Gama, which has stood there since 1898. It holds the King Carlos I oceanographic collection of specimens, gathered and preserved in pristine flasks, as well as models of bigger marine beasts. On the lower floor we are poltergeisted by several small tanks with remarkable live fish, which the students use for movement studies. The star, however, is a giant squid, resting in a vitrine coffin.Another place we usually visit for drawing sessions is the Museu Geológico in Rua da Academia das Ciências. The museum is housed in the same building that hosts the Academy. This is probably one of the loveliest street in Lisbon. On one side the gardens of almost Edwardian houses jut over garages, and on the other side stands the unassuming Academy façade and restrained working-class houses. The street ends in a narrow passageway to Rua do Século (also a candidate for loveliest street) crowned by a photogenic arch.Back in the IADE school building, I work in the professors’ room, so busy that sometimes I find myself totally alienated from the delightful urban landscape outside my window. Some days I notice the horizontal sunset light bathing the western side of the Bairro Alto hill only while packing my laptop, which I squeeze into the backpack along with my chlorine-smelling swimming gear.From the front side windows we used to see cruise ships docking at a shabby multipurpose terminal. Back then, only the boldest tourists would risk stepping down from these luxury vessels, imagining they were in Ceuta of the 17th century. Now they roam the city in tuk-tuks like Kafka’s king’s messengers, shaken until lunch blends totally with an afternoon drink, intoxicated by the drivers’ (often wrong) shouted explanations about the history of neighbourhoods and landmark buildings. The contribution of such groups to the city economy is questionable, since the ships pollute like hell and usually the tourists don’t even eat ashore thanks to the ships’ all-inclusive packages.By the end of the afternoon I’m back in Jardim das Amoreiras. French soccer moms pack in next to youthful groups and middle age locals around a kiosk that serves drinks and snacks. A playground attracts kindergarten toddlers and their exhausted parents. A television screen sometimes shows a football game. The tourists staying in the surrounding hotels and Airbnb apartments are absent, lingering still near the old centre or in the Belém attractions.Ullisabona, Olisipo, Lisboa: mythologically founded by Ulysses, she has seen Vasco da Gama depart and Columbus arrive, astonished Voltaire and seduced Madame Junot. Admired by Hans Christian Andersen, she was spied on by Ian Fleming, saddened by Amalia and suffocated by Salazar, energised by Eusebio and is today inhabited by Madonna. In her tenacity and reinvention she is like an old vampire woman lingering in her eternity, enjoying this renewed drug of tourism. She will be cruel to unfit people, will sarcastically destroy flipflop users’ feet and bachelorettes’ high heels, resent loud drinkers, and despise those who pretend to own her.

This must be our call to actionAccording to research published last week by US scientists, hajj is set to become a danger zone. As soon as next year, they say, summer days in Mecca could exceed the “extreme danger” heat-stress threshold. The news comes just weeks after over 2 million people completed their journey of a lifetime. The environmental threat to the holy pilgrimage is a panic button for British Muslims like me, signaling that the climate crisis is endangering an age-old sacred rite.Environmental stewardship may well be advocated by my faith – the Quran states that humans are appointed as “caretakers of the Earth” and the prophet Muhammad organised the planting of trees and created conservation areas called hima – but it hasn’t mobilised Muslims on a mass scale for what the world needs now: a global eco-jihad.Fazlun Khalid, founder of Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Sciences and author of Signs on the Earth: Islam, Modernity and the Climate Crisis, has been on a green mission for over 35 years, but his biggest challenge has been to motivate Muslims. “Islam is inherently environmental, but modernity has induced all of us to distance ourselves from nature. The reason I don’t give up is my grandchildren – what kind of planet will they inherit? How can they perform hajj under those conditions?”Khalid previously gathered a team of scholars and academics who drafted the Islamic declaration on climate change adopted at the International Islamic climate change symposium in Istanbul in 2015 (an event co-sponsored by Islamic Relief, a global charity that is again calling on Muslims to take action now if they want to safeguard the pilgrimage for future generations). Maria Zafar of Islamic Relief UK said: “Hajj has physically demanding outdoor rituals which can become hazardous to humans. It isn’t only Mecca, other sacred sites will be at risk too, like the religious sites in Jerusalem, the Golden Temple in India – it will affect what we hold dear to our hearts. We think that climate change is distant from us, but there is no area of life that it won’t touch.”If we are truly to tackle a catastrophe as huge as the climate crisis, we have to make it personal. Without a personal stake, it remains an abstract and we unite in perpetuating it. So if money is the only form of emotional investment for some, and if economics wields more power than the will to save our planet, we must use it. Next year Saudi Arabia is hosting the G20 summit, so let’s pressure the country to consider the financial threat due to a loss of religious tourism. Hajj is lucrative: economic experts have said revenues from hajj and umrah (a lesser pilgrimage undertaken any time of year) are set to exceed $150bn by 2022.“For the Saudis, hajj is more precious than oil,” says Dr Husna Ahmad, CEO of Global One, who’s been campaigning for a greener hajj for years. Ahmad created a green guide to hajj in 2011, and is now working on a green hajj app, which she plans to launch next year if funding is secured.With approximately 100m plastic bottles left behind each year after the pilgrimage ends, it’s clear that action is desperately needed. Slowly, Saudi authorities are beginning to implement a more environmentally friendly hajj by installing recycling points around the holy sites, and they aim to cut waste volumes by two-thirds by 2030. Pushing for change has been a struggle in the kingdom, but apathy is a wider problem. It’s bound up in socio-economic deprivation, and too often “saving the planet” is seen as something for the rich, a kind of green elitism.“Right now in the UK it feels like middle-class white women – and Sadiq Khan – are the only ones taking up the baton,” says Ahmad. “We know that climate change started with the European industrial revolution and poverty is inextricably linked to that.“People are trying to survive, you can’t blame them if climate change is not their priority. This is why achieving the UN sustainable development goals are high on my agenda.”The climate crisis does not exist in and cannot be tackled in isolation. While the big dogs must green-up their institutions and businesses, grassroots activists need better relations with governing bodies, more Muslims need to get involved with the broader debate and we all need to rethink our lifestyles – cut down on meat consumption, use less packaging and step back from throwaway consumerism.We all have a part to play – institutionally, socially, morally, economically and religiously. Whether it’s through the lens of our conscience, faith or finance, it’s imperative to find our own catalyst for action. If the threat to hajj can motivate Muslims, then that’s all for the good.• Remona Aly is a journalist and commentator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e21223fce40f64e49f33a2acb8352d2730b396fa/0_144_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd8e70356a836734a929623b3d6036b","title":"imaginary friends creative mind children","story":"When I was three, I had a very good friend named Gemma. She was fearless where I was fretful, rebellious where I was conservative and dextrous where I was clumsy. She was also entirely imaginary. With Gemma’s help and support, I almost made it to the top shelf of the bookcase before my parents found me – and “Gemma said it was OK!” did not save me from a telling off. Gemma was also very fond of Discos crisps and Bourbon biscuits, and I became very good at smuggling them into my bedroom for her.Some novelists have compared their relationships with their characters to a connection with imaginary friends. They may create and invent a personality, but these fictitious people often begin to behave in a way that wasn’t planned, sometimes disrupting the plot of a book entirely. In Aspects of the Novel, EM Forster wrote, “The characters arrive when evoked, but full of the spirit of mutiny … They ‘run away’, they ‘get out of hand’.” My friend the novelist Rosie Blake tells me, “I always wondered about authors who told me that their characters took on a life of their own. I used to think they sounded a bit pretentious, but then I found out it’s true. I’ll find that a minor character suddenly begins to appear where she wasn’t plotted to be, clamouring for more attention and a meatier part in the narrative. I used to try to block her out, but now I let her in and see where she takes me.”If you’ve enjoyed an imaginary friendship, I’d guess that you did not consciously sit down to create a perfect pal – they probably arrived unbidden, as a manifestation of thoughts and ideas you never knew you had. Our imaginary friends prompt us to explore and honour our curiosity. It is very hard to make the time and the space to do this as an adult. In order to be a good companion to an imaginary friend, you need to be able to make “what if?” into an exciting proposition. When we grow up, we’re too quick to finish the sentence with, “what if it goes wrong?”We know it’s important for adults to make time to play and yet few of us do so. We might not still need imaginary friends, but maybe we need to be reminded that a little bit of boredom is good for us, and that our brains can conjure up the best ideas when they are left to their own devices. If there are fewer imaginary friends populating the worlds that our children live in, that might lead to a future with fewer artists, writers and problem-solvers, which is a real cause for concern.We could respond to this news by panicking, restricting screen time and forcing under-10s to embark on creative play programmes. Or we could start by looking at our own lives and making sure that we’re giving ourselves time to get bored, and to stumble upon the thoughts and ideas that excite and ignite us. If we’re open to our own boredom, we’ll be less desperate to optimise and control the schedules of the people we love – and that could lead to greater insight, greater empathy and the discovery of exciting, surprising talent.As an adult, I think of impetuous, fearless Gemma whenever I have to do something that scares me – usually public speaking, rather than scaling a bookcase. But whenever I exceed my own expectations and meet myself in a place I didn’t think I could quite reach, I can hear my subconscious whispering, “Gemma made me do it”.• Daisy Buchanan is author of The Sisterhood – A Love Letter to the Women Who Shaped Me"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/892ec026e03bcada89521a0737a1b63271c99d80/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a8ab55246475cac77909c764fe7a3e8","title":"science museum workers england strike pay","story":"Staff at Science Museum sites across England have begun a 24-hour strike in protest over low pay.On Friday, hundreds of workers picketed outside museums in London, Manchester, Bradford, York and Wiltshire. Laurel Mackie, 42, an explainer who helps to put on shows and demonstrations at the Science Museum in south Kensington, joined the protest with her son Albert, seven.She said she earned less than the London living wage and found the cost of childcare a “struggle”. “Travel is expensive too,” she said. “I have to think about what time of day I travel which can be a bit of a rush when you’re with a child.”Mackie said she loved her job but wanted the Science Museum to pay staff a real living wage, similar to the nearby Natural History and Victoria and Albert museums in south-west London.She said the museums were important. “In this age, where truth is crucial, it’s important to know what is fact and what isn’t. Critical thinking really is critical,” she said. “Bringing children and adolescents here can introduce them to that.”Carlos Alvares, 54, an explainer who has worked at the London museum for 20 years, suggested public institutions should be held to higher standards over fair pay. “We are here to entertain and educate as well as facilitate the understanding of science to the public,” he said.Alvares added that he was “barely making enough to break even” and struggling to pay for travel from his home near Heathrow.The strike meant that some activities were not running at the Science Museum in South Kensington, the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford, the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, the National Railway Museum in York and the National Collections Centre in Wroughton.Outside the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester, striking staff waved signs punning on the museum’s exhibits. “Fair pay – it’s not rocket science” read one, a reference to Stephenson’s Rocket, built to run on the Liverpool and Manchester railway, the world’s first intercity passenger line. Front-of-house staff at the museum earned £8.70 an hour, 30p less than the real national living wage, the strikers said.Steve Roberts, a negotiations officer at Prospect, said SMG had made a surplus of £4m and could afford to pay staff more. He said members of the public were “surprised that dedicated staff are not getting a decent standard of pay”.Victor Durban, who was visiting the museum with his wife, Marian, and four-year-old grandson, Joseph, said he supported the strike. “What’s disgusting is the salary the director is getting and the yearly bonuses too. You don’t think about these things. The biggest problem is that they can’t charge entry.”However, museum staff said they wanted entry to remain free. “We want everybody to be able to come in and enjoy the museum,” Hamilton said.Prospect’s general secretary, Mike Clancy, said: “The Science Museum Group has some of the highest-profile museums in the country. As beacons of human progress it is ludicrous that they don’t pay all their workers enough to live on.“Our members in SMG love their jobs but they cannot carry on with year after year of real terms pay cuts and that is why they felt they had no option but to strike.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5408cd0b3ca8b88ff00d3de7f4a018f2bb969acb/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82a79484ada0c2aa6065d9479bf217d5","title":"richard ayoade webchat","story":"The director, actor, author, presenter and overachiever is joining us for a webchat on 5 September at 12pm BSTIs there another actor who could deliver the line, “I came here to drink milk and kick ass, and I’ve just finished my milk” with as much deadpan aplomb as Richard Ayoade?Before he became a flipping household name as the painfully geeky Maurice Moss in The IT Crowd, the world has owed the actor, writer, director and flaneur a great debt.

Cooking has become simpler, and we have eaten a lot of corn: perfect, self-packaged, hot-weather food. In a fix, it needs nothing more than butter and salt.Corn and risotto are not an obvious pairing, but after making this I wondered: why not? The sweetness of the corn and the creamy parmesan rice really show each other off. This risotto is perfect to cook when supplies are low, as the ingredient list is quite short and it requires just one pan and a hob.We’ve also eaten cob after cob whole, with everything from grated cheese and chilli to Indian green chutney on top. This, though, was the winner – all the green herbs with butter, honey and lots of salt.Use a mixture of any soft herbs you have to hand. This is a great way to use up any odds and ends of bunches you might have left over. Dill, mint, coriander, fennel tops, tarragon, chervil, parsley, basil and even thyme would work.4 corn on the cobFlaky sea salt100g butter2 tbsp honey1 large bunch mixed soft herbs (I used chives, dill, parsley and coriander), chopped1 tsp hot chilli powderIf your corn is still in the husks, peel open and tie them back with a little string they’ll help you hold your corn when you’re eating it (don’t worry if they don’t have husks).Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil with plenty of salt. Once boiling, drop your corn into the water with the husks hanging out, if your corn has them, taking care to keep them away from the cooking flame if you’re cooking over gas. Cook for five minutes for juicy, crunchy kernels.Carefully remove the corn from the boiling water and put them on a serving platter. While the cobs are still hot, dot them with butter and honey and turn in the buttery honey until coated. Sprinkle over the herbs and finish with a pinch of chilli powder and a good sprinkling of salt.I love stirring a risotto – there’s nothing more comforting to cook or eat. I blitz some of the corn to a puree here to add creaminess without having to add quite so much butter and cheese.3 corn on the cob800g vegetable stockExtra-virgin olive oil1 stick celery, finely chopped1 white onion, peeled and finely chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely choppedSalt and black pepper200g risotto rice (I use carnaroli)250ml (a large glass) white wine60g parmesan or vegetarian parmesan-style cheese, plus extra to serve1 large knob butter1 green chilli, deseeded and very finely choppedFirst, cut the corn kernels from the cobs into a bowl, then chop the shaved cobs into three.Pour the vegetable stock into a deep pan, add the chopped cobs and bring to a simmer, then keep warm on a low heat while you make the risotto, as you’ll want it to be hot when adding it to the rice.In a food processor, blitz a quarter of the kernels with a tablespoon of stock, until smooth and creamy set aside to add later.Meanwhile, heat a little olive oil in a large pan, add the celery, onion and garlic with a pinch of salt and cook on low for 10-15 minutes, until everything is soft and sweet, but not browned. Turn up the heat, add the rice and stir for a couple of minutes to seal the grains, then add the wine and let it evaporate.Once all the wine has evaporated, turn the heat down to medium-low and start adding the stock a ladleful at a time, allowing each ladleful to evaporate as you stir it in. When half the stock has been added, stir in the remaining corn, then continue adding the stock until the rice is cooked but still has a little bite to it, and the corn is tender. This will take about 30 minutes in total.Remove the risotto from the heat and stir in the cheese, blitzed corn, the butter and some salt and pepper. Pop a lid on top and leave to rest for a minute or two, then serve immediately, topped with a little extra grated parmesan and the chopped chilli."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9262dfac29628d4da1798bed736cc746c1969183/0_582_9447_5669/master/9447.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d87a32ba8af2885255f68f98b07a7979","title":"from quinoa bars to salmon skin chips whats behind the snacking revolution","story":"Forget breakfast, lunch and dinner. In the space of a generation, Brits have tripled their consumption of snacks – and the options are endlessBritain has undergone many food revolutions over the last generation olive oil has moved from pharmacist’s shelf to store-cupboard staple we’ve seen a boom in gin, and an even bigger one in veganism. But there is one that has gone less remarked – what Praveen Vijh calls “the snackification of Britain”.Vijh is 52 and grew up in Solihull during the era of Monster Munch and Wagon Wheels, both launched in the late 1970s. “There was very little snacking,” he says. “You might have half a Twix. Snacking was a big treat.” Official figures bear this out. In 1977, the year Monster Munch was launched, the average adult in Britain consumed 29g of crisps, nuts, seeds, popcorn or savoury snacks each week, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) figures. That’s less than a bag of crisps. Fast-forward to 2015, the most recent year for which we have such detailed data, and the figure is 89g, the equivalent of very nearly three bags of crisps. In the space of a generation, we have tripled our consumption of snacks – if not more: Defra’s figures do not include the myriad of other products now sold in the snack aisles, from cashew quinoa bars at Aldi to Itsu crispy seaweed thins at Waitrose.When did snacking become not only part of our everyday diet, but a fiercely fought battleground for supermarkets and food brands desperate to persuade us that their product can do us good? Even Cathedral City, Britain’s biggest cheese brand, has started packaging its product in 100-calorie “snack bars”. In reality, this is no more than a small slice of cheese, but one that the company describes on the pack as “high in protein, an ideal snack for on-the-go”, sold in Shell petrol stations alongside fizzy drinks.At Eat Natural, Vijh argues that one thing above all others is driving this trend: we are working longer and harder than ever before. That means many consumers, such as Malone, are missing meals, especially breakfast. “Consumers are leaving home earlier in the morning. This is not only in London, this is also in Nottingham, this is also in Birmingham – everywhere that we can see it’s absolutely on the increase,” he says, explaining that he receives data from every WHSmith, supermarket and railway station shop detailing the time of day people buy an Eat Natural bar. He says a decade ago the peak time was 11am. “It is now from seven or even 6.30 in the morning. That’s the biggest trend I’ve seen over the last 10 years.”The slow demise of the nuclear family has also played a part. “Living in inidual, smaller-person households has meant we’re not sitting down to eat as a family as much,” Vijh says. Malone shares a house with four other people and says that though they may not all sit down to share a meal together, they do snack together. “In the evening when I come home from work, my flatmates and I will often sit and watch TV with a large pack of tortilla chips or popcorn.” While her snacking at work is strictly healthy, in the evening it’s not. “If we don’t have any snacks in the house, it’s a crisis and someone has to go out and buy some.” Malone and her flatmates are precisely the people the big brands are trying to attract: health-conscious, but willing to indulge.It’s not only Unilever, with its purchase of Graze, that wants a slice of this. The past two years have seen a spike in snacking acquisitions: Kellogg’s bought the American protein bar company RXBar for $600m (£483m) PepsiCo, the parent company of Walkers, spent $200m buying Bare Snacks, which specialises in banana chips, as part of its mission to “make more nutritious products” and Mars, the confectionery giant, took a large stake in Kind, the cereal bar company, valuing the latter at $4bn. Mars said the Kind acquisition would help anchor “a newly formed global health and wellness platform”.And this is only the food giants there are tons of smaller startups trying to muscle in on the market. According to Nielsen, the market research company, an eye-popping 1,780 different snacking products were launched on to Britain’s shop shelves last year – everything from sweet chilli black-eyed pea puffs to oven-baked spelt bites and salted caramel beans.One supermarket, in particular, has encouraged this snack explosion: Sainsbury’s. Like all of the “big four” supermarkets, it is under intense pressure from the two German discount chains, Aldi and Lidl, which have chipped away at its market share. Its failed attempt to merge with Asda has left it scrabbling around for a convincing approach. One answer is snacking – specifically, offering customers a large number of unusual treats. “Our strategy is to give more reasons for customers to choose us,” explains Rachel Eyre, head of Future Brands at Sainsbury’s. “And one of the ways we want to do that is by offering innovative, exciting brands that you can’t find in other supermarkets.” In return for putting these small, start-up labels on a prominent “Taste of the Future” shelf, these brands commit to supplying only Sainsbury’s for an agreed period of time.Eyre is interested in everything from kombucha to craft gin, but focused on snacks. “Adult snacking in particular is very competitive. That’s because it sits at the intersection of this spaghetti junction of consumer trends, which means there is a huge amount of entrepreneurial heat,” Eyre says. The roads meeting in her junction metaphor are: our “busier on-the-go” lifestyles, and the joint rise of an interest in health and “premiumisation”, the phenomenon whereby consumers are occasionally willing to splash out on upmarket products. She adds: “I think of it as credits and debits: consumers are looking to make healthier and more considered choices. That means when they do indulge, they want to do so properly.”A prominent protein count written on the front, combined with a message about the company either transforming you – or the world – into something better, has become a key strategy in the healthy snack market. And it works, according to Eyre. In a bid to understand its customers’ emotional reaction to marketing or packaging, Sainsbury’s has recruited volunteers and rigged them up with heart scanners, sweat detection monitors and even eye-tracking headsets, observing them as they wander through the aisles. “We know where they are engaged around the stores, and that they are drawn to these stories,” she says. “These messages definitely resonate and, crucially, they go on to put those items in their basket.”One such brand is Yaar, which calls itself a “Nordic quark bar”, though it is made in Estonia by a Ukrainian who went to boarding school in England and then became a pharmaceutical entrepreneur in Singapore. Andrei Garbuz, 37, says the business of selling painkillers and selling snacks is very similar. “I saw a huge trend: the convergence of healthcare and food businesses. So I decided that if I was to start a new business, it would be a food business with a tilt into health. It’s a huge opportunity. Humanity is going back to Ayurveda – eating better for your health.”Quark is a fermented high-protein dairy product similar to yoghurt or cream cheese. The problem is that it is nearly always eaten out of a pot – so Garbuz has coated his quark in chocolate to make it an “on-the-go, no-spooning snack format”, available from the chiller cabinet. I found them a bit sickly, like a rich mini-cheesecake, but I can see that for those with a very sweet tooth they might be a treat that, at 140 cals, doesn’t blow the daily calorie count. Garbuz argues that “no-spooning is a radical concept”, delivering nutrients “in a permissible dosage”.His use of medical terminology is not an accident. Increasingly, snacks have become meal replacements and consumers do not want to have to scan the nutrient smallprint on the back they want just a simple message on the front. And where once it was calories, it is protein that has become the most appealing shorthand for healthy. According to Anthony Fletcher, chief executive of Graze: “Consumers are willing to pay far more for high-protein snacks. It started in the fitness community, people who went to the gym and were interested in building muscle. But now it’s far more about feeling full. Protein, in the consumer’s mind, helps fill you up, so you can eat a high- protein snack and it satiates. That’s important if there’s a missed lunch.”The protein fad helps explain the surprising rise of meat snacks while they may be high in salt or fat, they are very high in protein and so, according to Rosie While, product developer at Marks \u0026amp Spencer, represent “positive snacking”. While developed a new range of serrano ham, chorizo and salami crisps for this summer – not potato crisps, but actual slices of meat, air-dried and crunchy. While says the trend for air-drying has been particularly embraced by millennials, in contrast to their parents’ generation, who were more keen on calorie-counting. “It’s all about good ingredients, rather than bad ingredients that are being controlled by a certain calorie limit.” Still, she admits that the serrano ham crisp (99 calories a pack) is significantly outselling the chorizo and salami (130 calories). While points to 100 calories as the magic number many people still look for. “We do know that anything under 100 calories is something a customer will aim for if they are trying to be healthy.”Now that protein has gone mainstream, the next big trend is fibre. Vijh at Eat Natural argues that consumers are increasingly interested in gut health, as well as the growing number of studies that have associated diets high in fibre with a lower incidence of heart disease. “Fibre isn’t very sexy, but we know that people aren’t consuming enough of it,” he says. “It’s nothing new – my parents used to give us prunes for breakfast.” Graze now has a large number of snack boxes flagged as high in fibre, while even Walkers has launched a premium range of snacks (dried vegetable and nut mixes, pea and bean sticks) called Off The Eaten Path, some of which highlight fibre content.Vijh first experimented with a fibre bar a couple of years ago, and got it wrong. “We called the bar Better Inside, and did it a bit artificially using chicory root fibre,” a tasteless substance that Vijh admits had the texture of talcum powder. “That made the product taste a little bit weird, to be quite honest – just dry and powdery.” This summer he tried again, with a dark chocolate and sea salt bar called Fibre Packed, using figs as the main source of fibre. Is it still weird? “No, it’s delicious,” he says. “People have an aversion to highly processed ingredients. They want ingredients they recognise.”We finish our tour of the factory and head up to Vijh’s office, where his desk is surrounded by boxes of cereal bars and jars of ingredients that his developers are experimenting with (tomato powder and rice syrup, hinting at the Willy Wonka-ish possibility of a savoury cereal bar). I ask Vijh if he’s excited by the “snackification” of Britain, expecting an enthusiastic response. But he answers rather wistfully: “Actually, I would love to go back to the days where we used to all sit down together and eat meals as a family. I hope we don’t become a nation where we eat nothing but snacks.”But as the market intensifies, a return to the era of three square meals looks unlikely. I ask Malone if she could cope without her hit of Graze protein bites at work, or popcorn in the evening? “Good god! I am such a snacker. It’s something I do every day.” She laughs. “What would I do with my hands?”2004After decades of rectangular flapjacks and cereal bars, Bounce introduces the world to the spherical protein hit.2008Graham Bosher, a former executive at DVD subscription service LoveFilm, launches Graze, sending parcels of fresh fruit through the post.

But a very posh, expensive one. You still queue, order, ship your own drinks and sit open-plan, but it’s £14 for a small ham sandwich. The credit card machine asks you for a tip immediately before every transaction.” Too far, one may think. But no, the Arcade Food Theatre has arrived, boasting a name like a My Bloody Valentine spin-off project and a London location so central it’s literally underneath Centrepoint, within footfall of the hungry hordes who ransack Oxford Street Primark. It should not be a difficult place to sell food. The nearby branch of Chopstix is serving boxed noodles and hot spring rolls (15 for £2.50), hand over fist, from 10am-10pm every day. Yet most things are difficult in this food court – apologies, this “collection of independent kitchens and incubation-focused mezzanine space showcasing emerging culinary concepts”.The lineup is beyond doubt impressive, with the likes of delightful, growingly cultish bakery Pophams and Caso De Frango, who do posh piri piri chicken incredibly well in Borough. Oklava, Lina Stores and Pastorcito all have incredible pedigrees, bringing their Turkish, Italian and Mexican specialities to the mix. Arcade Food Theatre is a billion miles removed from loading a tray with Spud-U-Like and Taco Bell at Manchester Arndale Centre Food Court, or eating a streetfood burger at a picnic table under a railway arch. This place is luxuriously built and exhaustingly modern, like a “funky”, “hip” hotel one books for a European minibreak, which, within minutes, makes you weep for the dependable functionality of a Premier Inn.The concept, as far as I see it – and it’s heavily open for debate – is that one orders food at the inidual counters, and they make it from scratch, in anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes. There is seating near the counters. No signage anywhere informs the newbie where or how one should sit, pay, or collect food. There is nothing as gauche or functional as a buzzer to inform you the food is ready. There are no drinks available at many of the food stands. One is required to queue again at the cocktail bar area, where a small glass of Coca-Cola is £2.50 plus an immediate hustle for a tip.Arcade Food Theatre does not do takeaway. In an age when Deliveroo is king and restaurants are bending over backwards to ship food out to offices and commuters in any way possible, they do not have boxes and look genuinely shocked you’d want one. “We cannot maintain the standard,” I’m told at Tou, the upstairs “incubation kitchen”, which according to the internet opens at 8am, but when I went for breakfast on a Saturday at 11am, I was told they open, maybe, at 1pm. I gave up on food that time and went straight to the bar for a pretty good bloody mary. Tou specialises in the “sando”, which is a Japanese word for “we are sticking a deep-fried breaded pork cutlet between two slices of brioche while playing Mr Wendell by Arrested Development semi-ironically – give me £14 plus tip”.On my second jaunt to Arcade Food Theatre, I whipped through around £33 in about half an hour. London’s best almond croissant, from Pophams, costs £3.80 and a latte another £3. At Oklava, I chose a freshly baked, cheese and butter, Black Sea pide, which makes Turkish people sigh when it is compared to pizza, but alas, it’s hard to avoid. At about six inches, with egg yolk, black garlic and za’atar, it was delightful, definitely decadent and punchily priced at £12. Returning to Tou, I chose the tofu sando: chopped boiled egg laced with wasabi mayonnaise, spring onion and fresh coriander with two pockets of breaded, deep-fried silken tofu between brioche-like Japanese milk bread, for £10.50. This feisty blend is clearly someone, somewhere’s idea of a delicious sandwich, and I thoroughly respect that.This sando has graced dozens of Instagram feeds, where diners who were given it for free at the opening parties said they had an amazing, thoroughly seamless experience at this brilliant, clever new food-hall concept and that this was the greatest sandwich ever. Frankly, I don’t believe them.Arcade Food Theatre, 103-105 New Oxford Street, London, WC1A, 020-7519 1202. arcade-london. Open Mon-Sat 8am–12am, Sunday 10am-10.30pm.

Email feast@theI’ve never got the hang of fried eggs. Mine either end up raw, burned or with a texture akin to Haribo.Stephen, StockportWe shouldn’t be afraid to go back to basics, Stephen. Take comfort in the words of Spanish chef and restaurateur José Pizarro: “Eggs can be the easiest thing in the world to make, but also the most difficult.” So consider this eggs 2.0.“It sounds like your pan is way too hot,” says Miles Kirby, chef director of London’s Caravan group and master of all things brunch. Starting with a good, nonstick pan, he says, will relieve some of the need to have the temperature just right. Size also matters: “Make sure you’re not overcrowding the pan: fried eggs only take a few minutes to cook, so it doesn’t matter if you’re cooking them one at a time.” Few weekends are ruined by waiting an extra few minutes for brekkie.Kirby follows in his mother’s footsteps and fries in oil, usually vegetable – sometimes rapeseed, but never olive – as favoured by the likes of Jamie Oliver. “Olive oil has a flavour I don’t particularly care for with my fried eggs.” However, it’s this flavour (and lower acidity) that makes olive oil a winner in Pizarro’s book: “I always, always use it: just a little, heated until smoking” (note: cold whites hitting a not-hot-enough pan are going to stick).Whichever way you go, oil, Kirby advises, is the key to getting that crisp, brown base, whereas butter “tends to steam the eggs a little because of the water content”. Unsurprisingly, Michel Roux Jr, chef patron at Le Gavroche and a Frenchman, hangs his hat on butter, heating “until frothy” before cracking in the egg. Feast’s perfectionist Felicity Cloake is also Team Butter, instead adding the egg once it has melted “but not begun to foam”. Cloake and Pizarro adopt a similar approach by basting the whites with the fat after a couple of minutes, avoiding even a mere splash on the yolk. Secret fat option number three comes from Delia Smith: bacon. However, as you’re unlikely to be putting away enough rashers to have sufficient supplies of fat, we’ll park this one here.As ever, if you keep your eggs in the fridge, let them come up to room temperature before cracking – starting with a cold egg, Cloake says, means you’re more likely to overcook the yolk trying to get the white to set. Fresh eggs are best for frying as they’re less likely to spread in the pan (the stronger the proteins in the white, the neater the shape) – but, Cloake suggests, if you’re struggling to perfect those whites, a slightly older egg that spreads and therefore gives a thinner white could work to your frying advantage. Pizarro breaks his eggs into a bowl or cup first, before sliding into a hot pan where, on landing, it should sizzle and spit a little.A lid, just smaller than the pan, is also a trusted ally: “When the bottom of the egg is cooked to your liking, put a lid on top, take it off the heat and the residual heat will cook the egg,” says Kirby. Roux waits for the white to “frizzle” before covering and turning off the heat and leaving for a minute, while Cloake covers and leaves on a low heat for three and a half minutes. Seasoning should then be done at the last minute.Some suggest crispy whites and soak-up-with-toast yolk success can be found in separating the eggs: frying the whites and adding the yolk in the last few minutes of cooking. This seems like a lot of faff, especially when there are much simpler ways to crack (sorry) this.Have you got a culinary dilemma?

Winemaking and viticulture in the region has also improved over the years. There’s less leafiness as the wines age, resulting in vintages that are ripe without being jammy, classically European though more generous in their fruit, and beautifully poised and polished.Names to bear in mind are some of the oldest on the South African wine scene – such as Kanonkop, Meerlust, Rustenberg and Vergelegen. Unlike most of the cheap and cheerful South African reds you’ll come across in the supermarket, good cabernet sauvignon doesn’t come cheap. You won’t find much under £10 (Chile’s a better hunting ground at this price point to be honest) but they compare favourably with Bordeaux and California as the price creeps up.Among Joe’s selection, Rustenberg’s top of the range 2009 Peter Barlow is still available for the comparatively reasonable sum of £26.99 from York Wines, though their more widely available John X Merriman, which is on offer in Waitrose (see today’s picks), is the one most of us would be happy to settle for.From neighbouring Franschhoek rather than Stellenbosch, but as smooth and polished as a Stellenbosch.The baby brother of Rustenberg’s Peter Barlow (above).

For a year they were held in captivity, and were raped. They managed to escape their captors, and find their way across the desert to a camp in Madinatu, in Borno state.Though they had made it to relative safety, life in the camp was hard for the traumatised teenagers. They had had no contact with their family since their abductions, and there was little to eat. They had to fend off unwelcome advances by local community law enforcers, including members of the Civilian Joint Task Force, who, they say, offered food in exchange for sex.“It was so frustrating having to beg for food, and coming into contact with people who only wanted to exploit us,” says Aisha. “We were ready to do anything to leave Madinatu.”One morning as the girls went in search of firewood outside the camp, a group of women stopped them, asking them if they would be interested in work as hairdressers in Italy.“They told us we would be well paid, and that we’d be given a place to stay,” says Halima. “We were so happy we were going to leave all our troubles in Madinatu and make money abroad.”The women were traffickers. Aisha and Halima were taken to central Nigerien city of Agadez, to a “connection house”, where they were instructed to wait until the smugglers were ready to continue their journey through north Africa for the Mediterranean crossing. Their arrival had coincided with a government crackdown on smugglers, and they found themselves moved from one house to another to escape arrest. When finally they were driven from the city towards the southern Libyan town of Sebha, their trafficker spotted a police convoy patrolling the route through the desert. Worried he would be apprehended, he ordered the girls to get out of the car and drove away.Abandoned in the desert, the girls feared for their lives. “We almost died of heat, and had to drink our pee to stay alive,” says Halima. They were rescued after about two hours by a passing car, who took them back to Agadez. There, a Nigerian woman took pity on them, giving them cash to pay their fare back to the Nigeria.Aisha and Halima’s story is all too common. Unofficial reports based on survivors’ testimony and local data suggest there have been at least 17 cases of trafficking out of Madinatu camp in the last two years. The majority of the victims were girls aged under 18.The situation is reflected across the region. The 2019 US State Department Trafficking in Persons report revealed that “sexual exploitation, including sex trafficking, of IDPs in camps, settlements, and host communities around Maiduguri remained a pervasive problem”. It noted that security personnel are also involved in this criminal activity.When they finally returned to the Madinatu camp, Aisha and Halima made it their mission to warn other girls against the dangers of trafficking. They became involved with the Caprecon Development and Peace Initiative, which educates girls in refugee camps on how traffickers make their approaches, and the huge risks involved. Aisha and Halima are now part of the organisation’s advocacy, and campaign against trafficking in Madinatu.“These people are criminals, who have no jobs to offer anybody,” Aisha recently told a group of women at the Madinatu camp. “When you fall into their trap, they sell you into slavery.”Another girl at Madinatu, Sarah, is also involved with the campaign, after surviving a similar fate to Aisha and Halima. When she was 15 years old, Boko Haram attacked the camp where she lived, killing her mother, and abducting and raping Sarah.She escaped to Madinatu, but desperate over the lack of food at the camp, she turned to prostitution on the streets of Maiduguri. There she met a woman who offered the chance of work in a hairdressing salon in Italy – but like Aisha and Halima, she only made it as far as Agadez. After some months of waiting in a connection house, she was told she needed to go into sex work to pay her rent. She escaped.“I came back feeling so devastated and worried about my future,” Sarah says. “It felt like I had lost everything, including my soul, to the trafficker.”With support from Caprecon, the three girls have formed their own group to keep watch over the camp. Working with them are fellow trafficking survivor Nana Abdullahi, who was taken to Niger in 2015, and Hajja Alooma, who was approached by a trafficker in 2018.“We thought that just talking to women and children about trafficking would not be enough to stop traffickers from targeting them,” says Halima.Every morning, the girls note which children leave the camp, and where they are going, and then search for them if they have not returned three hours after their departure.“We want to be sure that they are not going to meet someone who could turn out to be a trafficker,” says 16-year-old Hajja, who rejected an offer to work as a salesgirl in Niger from a man she met in Maiduguri because she felt he wasn’t genuine. “If we are not very watchful, more children will fall into the hands of human traffickers.”When strangers come to the camp, the girls welcome them politely and ask them the reason for their visit.“If we are not satisfied … we invite the vigilantes working near the camp to interrogate the person,” says Nana Abdullahi, whose male trafficker met her on the streets of Maiduguri, where she sold fruit to earn money. He had promised to help get her a job outside the city. “If there is reason to hand over suspected traffickers to the police, the vigilantes will do so.”One afternoon, the girls spotted a young woman who had walked into the camp and was speaking to some children there. They confronted her, and when she couldn’t explain the reason for her visit, they summoned local community law enforcers.“She couldn’t escape because many girls had surrounded her,” says Nana, who escaped from her trafficker at the age of 15. “We then handed her over to the vigilantes, who set her free after warning her never to set foot in the camp again.”It is when girls leave the camp in search of water, firewood and food that they are particularly at risk, explains Jibrin Bukkar, Caprecon’s project coordinator. “Traffickers always keep a close eye on the movement of women and girls.”Caprecon is not the only organisation working to protect Madinatu’s most vulnerable from being exploited. “We are encouraging women and girls to stand up against trafficking and report to us any incident of abuse and exploitation, by anyone, including security officials,” says Yusuf Mohammed, who oversees the Madinatu unit of the Borno Community Coalition, a group of local leaders and humanitarian workers assisting survivors of the Boko Haram insurgency in Borno state. “Our role is to protect women and children from being exploited by selfish iniduals and groups.”The girls in the group supported by Caprecon are under no illusions about the importance of their work. “We want to make sure traffickers stay away completely from IDP camps,” says Halima."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2c1704341058ee29ed23a851f6c8a1f61d34047/0_116_5138_3082/master/5138.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12a7deb546f1da58f2f396b3be98e495","title":"i spend so much time eating i must be expert","story":"Surely by now I should be on Saturday Kitchen, cooking eggs at speed and flirting with Matt Tebbutt about his holiday-in-Provence tanI have eaten food for well over double the 10,000 hours required, according to the popular theory, to make me an expert.

Just when I think I’m into my groove, an article tells me that my plates are incorrectly portioned, or the pace of my chews is not mindful enough. I have made some progress, though. I’ve learned that all recipe writers are involved in a conspiracy to lie about “prep” time.

(Give me an unnecessary food descriptor – not just cheddar, but cave-aged cheddar – and I will beg you to, please, just take my money.)I may not have mastered eating, but I’m having a lot of fun trying. Recently, my very, very English boyfriend joined my family at a special sprawling Indian buffet for Eid. As we passed each other in the aisles we’d point out where we’d seen each other’s favourites – lamb chops over there, biryani that way.“There are some chips over there,” I said to my beloved as he passed. “You’re the third person to say that to me,” he said, chuckling. “Everyone seems very keen to tell the one Englishman where the chips are.”A buffet is an art all of its own plate up wrong and you create a Frankenstein meal, a collision of foods that were never meant to be. And so, after too many monstrous mouthfuls, we gave up, retreating to the summer kerbside with bowls of chips, laughing at how we could get a meal so wrong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff452d9fac3b22b42701f5c903f2643f01c0e6d9/37_733_2630_1578/master/2630.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=298a7197158b5bf617c2c43073a4772d","title":"tracks of the week reviewed thom yorke the 1975 bat for lashes","story":"The Radiohead man drops a dancefloor banger (not really), Matty Healy gets shouty, and Natasha Khan goes 80sSturgill Simpson, yeah?

Asked to clarify her position on proroguing parliament given her previous opposition, she said: “I’m a member of the cabinet, I fully support the prime minister.”Pressed again on whether she still harboured doubts about the plan as the  struggled to keep pace with her along Parliament Street, she repeated firmly: “I support the prime minister.”When asked to respond to critics’ suggestion that proroguing parliament represented an affront to democracy, she said nothing and walked away.Prorogation would mean the end of the Conservative party” – 6 JuneMorning, how are you? Sorry. How are you?” – ThursdayThe letter, dated 6 June, added: “A policy on Brexit to prorogue parliament would mean the end of the Conservative party as a serious party of government.”Giving a speech during the campaign four days later, Hancock referenced war veterans saying that proroguing parliament would go against “everything that those men who waded onto those beaches fought and died for”. He added: “And I will not have it.”Now, apparently, he will. Asked by the  to clarify whether his position had changed, his spokesman failed to comment.

How are you?”It would not be true to the best traditions of British democracy” – 9 JuneParliamentarians will have plenty of time to debate Brexit” – WednesdayLeave-supporting Michael Gove has also spoken out against suspending parliament. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show in early June: “Proroguing parliament in order to try and get no deal through, I think would be wrong.”Gove, appointed chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster by Johnson last month, added: “I think it would be wrong for many reasons. I think it would not be true to the best traditions of British democracy.” found a gaggle of remain protesters gathered outside the Cabinet Office at lunchtime, where Michael Gove was meeting union leaders from Unite and GMB to discuss their concerns about the “catastrophic” impact of a no-deal Brexit on Britain’s manufacturing industry.He did not do much to allay their fears, it seems. Jude Brimble, the national secretary of the GMB Union’s manufacturing section, labelled the government’s approach “lastminute”.Unite’s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, condemned proroguing parliament, calling it an outrage and a silencing mechanism.Asked to clarify his position, Gove’s spokesman pointed the  to an interview he conducted with the BBC on Wednesday. Pressed on whether proroguing parliament was a political attempt to stop debate on Brexit and block MPs from preventing the country leaving the EU without a deal, Gove replied: “It’s certainly not. The prime minister is clear that he wants to use a new parliamentary session in order to ensure that the people’s priorities are met. It’s also the case that parliamentarians will have plenty of time when we come back next week to debate Brexit.”Nobody should consider involving the Queen” – 16 JuneI’m here on a visit to work out what’s going on in my department” – ThursdayDid she still think approaching the Queen would be an outrage when Jacob Rees-Mogg went to see her on Wednesday? Such questions did not seem to please her during a visit to Belfast. Still, at least she retained a laser-like focus on her day job.Asked about proroguing parliament, she replied: “I’m here on a visit to work out what’s going on in my department, how people are helping people into work. And what I’ve seen today has been really reassuring.” Asked again about the suspension of parliament as she got into a waiting car, she said: “I’m going to continue doing my job as secretary of state for work and pensions.” Her spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.You don’t deliver on democracy by trashing democracy” – 16 JuneThe chancellor, Sajid Javid, was also staunchly opposed to shutting down parliament during the Tory leadership campaign. “You don’t deliver on democracy by trashing democracy ... we are not selecting a dictator of our country,” he said. As the  surveilled the Treasury, Javid was nowhere to be seen to explain his position. Nor did his spokeswoman answer its questions. he also seemed to be absent from the airwaves.On the proroguing of parliament, a government spokesperson said: “We are currently in the longest parliamentary session in almost 400 years and it’s crucial that we put a bold and ambitious domestic programme to MPs so that we can deliver on people’s priorities across the country. To do this we need a Queen’s speech. This is about providing parliament with a new legislative programme that will help the NHS, fight crime, invest in infrastructure and cut the cost of living.“As we have said previously, prorogation to suspend parliament, to block MPs further consideration of Brexit is not something we support. MPs will sit next week, the week after, the week before EU council, and two weeks after. Not only that, but the government will put its entire domestic agenda, and inevitably its approach to Brexit, to the vote as part of the Queen’s speech, with major votes on 21 and 22 October.”Back outside the Cabinet Office, Brimble was furious about ministers’ change of tack. “They’re playing politics with people’s lives, they’re playing politics with people’s livelihoods,” she said. “They’re playing politics with the future of this country to appease the Brexiters in the Tory party.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f224e4e590dbe02406b7af7798da0861b50cc0b/0_58_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d43183bbd83730689393ad4e775c6883","title":"labour has support for legisation to block no deal says chakrabarti","story":"Tory MP denies coordinating plans with Commons Speaker, John BercowOne of the leading Conservative architects behind plans to stop no deal has said MPs do have time to pass legislation on it, but denied plans were being coordinated with the House of Commons Speaker.However, MPs from different parties are believed to be still at odds over the details of what any legislation to halt no deal should be, how to stop Boris Johnson from circumventing any new law, and crucially what the aim of any extension to article 50 should be, whether extra time for negotiations, a second referendum or a general election.Sir Oliver Letwin, who led efforts to stop no deal earlier this year by passing a bill with the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, said “there probably is time” to get a measure to block a no-deal Brexit through parliament.A number of prominent Conservatives, including the former cabinet ministers Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Rory Stewart, have indicated they will back the efforts next week but Letwin said he was not complacent about numbers.“It’s a foolhardy person who predicts the number of MPs who will vote either way on an issue of this kind and we will just have to see whether we can acquire a majority of the required kind,” he said on Friday.“I know that there are a number of my colleagues who feel as I do, that a disorderly no-deal exit is a very bad idea, and they have in the past been willing to come and support efforts to prevent that happening and I very much hope that will happen again.”A senior MP close to the rebels’ discussions said all efforts would be on passing a bill forcing the government to request an extension, but there were still question marks over how long an extension should be and for what purpose.“If the legislation is vague, as it was in the Cooper bill in April – where the extension length was unspecified – Boris could simply ask for another six hours’ extension and satisfy the legal requirement.”Letwin denied reports that the House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, had broken off his family holiday to discuss “cooking up plans” with him to stop parliament being prorogued.“There’s no question of any MP cooking up any deal with the Speaker. You cannot do that. The Speaker has to follow the rules,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today programme.“It’s perfectly true that over many months I have been speaking to the clerks and the Speaker to establish what the procedures are. I have talked to the Speaker and the clerks on many occasions and will continue to do so.”Letwin said his focus would be on stopping no deal, rather than challenging prorogation of parliament. “It’s not my business to stop the prorogation. That is going on through the courts,” he said. “There are several court actions under way. I would like to see the prorogation not happen. Whether it is lawful or not, the courts will decide. That is not for MPs to decide.”Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, said she believed “this abusive early shutdown of parliament has strengthened those potential numbers” prepared to back action against no deal.“You can never be absolutely certain until the moment you expect people to put up,” she told Today. “My own soundings and those of colleagues over the last couple of days since the constitutional outrage give me greater comfort that minds are now focused, particularly on the Conservative side.”She added she was confident of any new law being passed through the House of Lords, and said MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit would sit in parliament over the weekend if necessary. “I believe there are means of preventing any sort of public school dirty tricks working even in the House of Lords,” she said.Opposition peers expect Tories in the Lords to attempt to filibuster the legislation, which will need to have passed through all its parliamentary stages and received royal assent before parliament is suspended or it will fall.The Liberal Democrats’ leader in the Lords, Dick Newby, said the government could be defeated. “The government’s tactic to stop the bill in the Lords could be to pack it with hostile amendments and then attempt to filibuster the bill.“On our side we can interrupt and put the amendments to a vote and, depending on how many there are, we could even sit all night every day through Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We have the troops and we have the camp beds. People will be queuing up to stay.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8434c79bc926944336173dd0dad90e320ae4ac1/411_210_1853_1112/master/1853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06e5cf59c56cc8ba89969dd31999ae26","title":"sajid javid was not told in advance of advisers sacking by cummings","story":"Sonia Khan was accused of misleading PM’s strategist over contact with ex-Hammond aideThe chancellor, Sajid Javid, was not informed in advance about the sacking of one of his senior advisers by Boris Johnson’s strategist Dominic Cummings, it has emerged.Sonia Khan, Javid’s media adviser, was escorted from No 10 by a police officer after being accused of misleading Cummings over her contact with iniduals close to the former chancellor Philip Hammond, who has been trying to block a no-deal Brexit.Downing Street rebuffed speculation that she had leaked the government’s no-deal planning report, Operation Yellowhammer, to the press.Khan was the second adviser working for Javid to be sacked by No 10, leading to suggestions that Javid is becoming increasingly isolated from the core of the Johnson regime.One former Whitehall colleague of Khan’s said: “Let’s hope Saj makes a stand and sticks up for her. I won’t hold my breath though.”This week, Javid’s first major speech on the economy was cancelled 24 hours before he had been due to deliver it in Birmingham. Downing Street, rather than the Treasury, announced a proposed cut to fuel duty that had ben briefed to the papers over the weekend.A No 10 spokesman said: “We don’t comment on inidual staffing and personnel matters.”A fiery exchange between Cummings and Khan is understood to have revolved around whether she had had contact with a former Hammond staff member. It is understood Khan was asked to hand over her work phone, and also presented her personal phone to Cummings. Downing Street made clear that Khan was not being blamed for the leak of the Yellowhammer documents on no-deal planning. A senior government source said: “Sonia Khan was not responsible for the Yellowhammer leak.”Whitehall sources confirmed that the reason Khan was dismissed on the spot was because she had been in contact with people from a group of Conservative politicians working against Johnson by trying to work out ways to avoid a no-deal Brexit, and that she had lied about her contact with them.Three other women in senior advisory, policy and organisational roles in the Conservative party have also left since Johnson became prime minister.Sources close to the government have described an emerging pattern in the way they have been dismissed, which they have described as “opaque and shocking” and not always involving a clear explanation of what they have done wrong.One Tory insider said the way some former staffers had been treated by No 10 was “horrific”.Special advisers, known as Spads, are said to be deeply concerned about the sudden departure of Khan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24f27af7ff0547de85e10aa0903c065d71a9db7f/339_73_757_454/master/757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eed6cf00ced05bddf258814d200f335","title":"shetland byelection liberal democrats retain scottish parliament seat","story":"Beatrice Wishart elected as Lib Dems’ new MSP, beating high-profile SNP campaignShetland has elected its first female parliamentarian, as the Liberal Democrats held on to the Holyrood constituency.The hard-fought byelection included a high-profile campaign from the Scottish National party,during which the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, visited the islands three times in a month.The byelection was prompted by the resignation of Tavish Scott, a former leader of the Scottish Lib Dems, who had held the seat since the creation of the Scottish parliament in 1999. He announced that he was leaving politics in July to take up a post with Scottish Rugby.Sturgeon visited Shetland three times during the contest, attracting criticism from opposition candidates that she had never visited the islands as first minister outside an election campaign.Wishart said she was honoured to “to make a little bit of history by becoming the first female parliamentarian in Shetland” after what she described as a rollercoaster campaign. She said: “Shetland has once again rejected Scottish nationalism and shown that it has not been taken in by the bullying tactics.”Wills said that the SNP had taken Shetland from being Scotland’s safest seat to one of the SNP’s top targets in 2021. “We’ve achieved our best ever result in Shetland and the increase in our vote is hugely encouraging. After 12 years in government, we have given the Lib Dems a run for their money in what was the safest seat in Scotland.”Polling expert John Curtice said that beating the Lib Dems in their Shetland stronghold “was always going to be a tall order” for the nationalists.He told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme: “The high turnout shows this was a fiercely local context.

Writing in the journal Science, an international team of researchers report how they drew on existing genetic databases to conduct the largest study yet into genetics and same-sex sexual behaviour.Dr Brendan Zietsch, co-author of the research from the University of Queensland in Australia, said that does not mean the rest is due to upbringing or culture. “For example, it is thought that non-genetic factors before birth, such as the hormonal environment in the womb, also play an important role,” he told the .The team then looked at which genetic variants might be behind the link, using data from more than 400,000 participants in the UK Biobank project and more than 68,000 iniduals whose data was collected by the company 23andMe.Researchers found five genetic variants – tiny differences in DNA – that showed a clear link to same-sex sexual behaviour, two in both men and women, two found only in men and one found only in women. The team believe one, found only in men, might be involved in sex hormone regulation, not least because it is linked to male-pattern balding.Neale stressed that the scale of the influence of non-genetic factors, complexities of sexual behaviour, and difficulties in precisely measuring the size of any variant’s effects, means it is not possible to use genetic information to predict whether an inidual will have same-sex partners.The study provides a number of insights, including that there is overlap between genetic predisposition to same-sex sexual behaviour and traits such as openness to experience, as well as predisposition to mental health problems.“One possibility is that stigma associated with same-sex sexual behaviour causes or exacerbates mental health issues. This could create a genetic correlation,” said Zeitsch.The authors also say their findings call into question the idea that sexuality exists on a single scale.However, the study has limitations including that it is based mainly on people of European ancestry, while the age range of participants does not fully reflect that of the wider population. It also relied on self-reported behaviour.The idea that genetics might play a role in same-sex attraction was propelled into the spotlight in 1993 when Dean Hamer, a scientist at the US National Cancer Institute, and his team found links between DNA markers on the X chromosome and male sexual orientation.The findings caused considerable controversy, with the media dubbing the discovery the “gay gene”.Subsequent research has thrown up mixed results, although recent studies have supported the theory that genetics plays a role in sexual orientation.Hamer said he was delighted by the latest research. “This provides yet another strand of evidence, another approach, showing that there is a strong and significant genetic contribution to people’s sexual behaviour,” he said. However, unlike Hamer’s work, the latest study does not show any special importance of the X chromosome. The researchers say that is not surprising, adding the previous findings would not meet today’s bar for importance, and were based on a small sample size.Hamer said he was not surprised either – although he put it down to the latest study looking at same-sex behaviour rather than sexual orientation. Qazi Rahman, a leading authority on sexual orientation research from King’s College London, welcomed the study but said that the databases involved only captured information from a small percentage of people who were invited to participate. That, he said, means that the genetic variants found in the latest research might reflect another trait particular to those who chose to respond.Rahman added he was not surprised that the genetic variants identified only have small inidual effects, pointing out that since same-sex behaviour is linked to having to fewer offspring, evolution is likely to hide such variants in effect.A website set up by the researchers to explain the study gives a clear message: “This study provides further evidence that erse sexual behaviour is a natural part of overall human variation.”Rahman agreed, stressing that the findings do not change the fact that everyone should be treated with respect. “The causes of a trait shouldn’t influence how we see it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b12097b1ad70750ec96a176bef07c13c8c6124f/0_149_4513_2707/master/4513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92bf59a98d6f8af2d823a7131fa373ef","title":"compasses to point true north for first time in 360 years","story":"Over the past few hundred years in the UK all compass needles have pointed west of true northAt some point over the next two weeks, compasses at Greenwich will point true north for the first time in about 360 years.And for some parts of the UK, this may not happen for another 20 years. Either way, it is a once-in-a-lifetime event.The angle a compass needle makes between true north and magnetic north is called declination. As the magnetic field changes all the time, so does declination at any given location.Over the past few hundred years in the UK, declination has been negative, meaning that all compass needles have pointed west of true north.The line of zero declination, called the agonic, is moving westward at a rate of around 12 miles (20km) a year, experts say.By next month, the compass needle will point directly to true north at Greenwich in London, before slowly turning eastwards.The Royal Observatory Greenwich was established in 1676 and, from 1839, hosted the specialised magnetic observatory that made continuous measurements from 1840 onwards. In 1926, the instruments were moved to Abinger in Surrey, as electrified railway lines had made it impossible to measure the magnetic field.Dr Ciaran Beggan, a geomagnetism scientist at the British Geological Survey’s Lyell Centre in Edinburgh, said: “At some point in September, the agonic will meet zero longitude at Greenwich. This marks the first time since the observatory’s creation that the geographic and geomagnetic coordinate systems have coincided at this location.“The agonic will continue to pass across the UK over the next 15 to 20 years. By 2040, all compasses will probably point eastwards of true north.“It is, at present, impossible to predict how the magnetic field will change over decades to centuries, so the compass may well point east of true north for another 360 years in the UK.”However, the experts have stressed that zero inclination will have no impact on daily life.Beggan added: “Compasses and GPS will work as usual – there’s no need for anyone to worry about any disturbance to daily life.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

A red rivulet drips down her face from a cut above her left eye but she gives a thumbs up and smiles for the camera, blinking the salty spray and the blood out of her eyes.It seems like a lucky escape.“I saw her a couple of minutes ago, she’s real happy,” a commentator reports during a television highlights show. “She has a little tiny scar up there, they didn’t have to put stitches in, she got some glue and she’s back out here enjoying the fun.”Maidana started vomiting that night. She was diagnosed with a mild concussion after a scan at an emergency room and told to rest. She returned home to Hawaii with a black eye. A few days later her mind and her body began to fail.At the time of the competition in March 2014 at Nelscott Reef, a two-hour drive from Portland, Maidana was one of the best big-wave surfers in the world. Since taking up the sport in her early twenties she had worked tirelessly, obsessively, spending hours each day developing her skills in the wild waves on Maui’s famous North Shore and hours on land building up her fitness.Yet within weeks of her board smashing into her forehead she could barely get off the couch or hold a conversation. Her tongue was leaden. She was too weary to walk her dog. Even sending a text message was exhausting. She was dizzy, confused, anxious, depressed and paranoid. Three months after the accident she got orced.“My world just crumbled. I lost my husband, my dog, my house, my sponsorship, I had a coaching business, I couldn’t do it any more. I lost everything,” she recalls. “The cut, the cut in your eyebrow! We were all concerned about the blood, instead of what’s happening underneath.”While concussions in major contact sports, notably American football, attract most of the research and media attention, traumatic head injuries in surfing are the shadow amid the sunshine – rarely discussed and poorly understood despite their potentially devastating effects.Studies suggest a significant minority of surfers suffer head injuries that carry a risk of cognitive decline in addition to the immediate danger of drowning.An analysis of surfing-related concussions on the west coast of Canada by Nikolaus Dean at the University of British Columbia in 2018 found that the sport’s culture “encouraged risk-taking behaviors and the denial and downplaying of the injury”. There is a reluctance to wear protective headgear, limited medical help and established protocols compared to major team sports and peer pressure to return to the waves without adequate recovery time.“The lifestyle is all happy, we’re at the beach, and the sponsors show that image,” Maidana says. “Nobody talks about concussions in surfing and nobody ever wants to talk about mental illness.”Another elite big-wave surfer, Shawn Dollar, set a world record in 2012 by paddling into a 61ft wave. He also competed at Nelscott Reef in 2014. The following year he smashed into a boulder while surfing in a remote location off the central Californian coast, breaking his neck in four places and suffering a concussion. He had to walk with assistance for a mile to reach his car and be driven to hospital.Bones healed but his brain is still a work in progress. “It looked like I’d played the equivalent of high school, college and professional football,” he says. “I’ve had a full recovery but I still am improving, honestly, I still have to take care of myself every day. I’m doing really, really well but it’s taken, like, three years and a lot of work.”He felt less mentally sharp after the blow. “I was kind of paying attention to what was going on in the news with the NFL and stuff like that but I was a little bit in denial about it, it just seemed crazy that I could be experiencing those type of things just from surfing. And there wasn’t any data out there but I was noticing that I was getting more foggy-headed and slower over time, it was affecting my well-being,” he says.Maidana returned to the water but eventually realized that she was “causing concussions over my concussions. Like a boxer’s brain, basically.” In dire need of money, with her medical care not covered by insurance, she tried delivering pizza and cleaning houses but was too unwell.To force herself away from the ocean she moved to Austin, Texas, and took a job in a cafe. “A doctor told me when I got to Austin, ‘you are an inch from a stroke’, if I kept surfing,” she says. “I removed myself from the island to heal to save my life.”At one point, when she did not maintain a strict healthy diet, she had suicidal thoughts. “It was like - just end it, just end it, just end it. A lot of it was the nostalgia of what I lost. ‘Life without big-wave surfing is nothing, look what your life was before, living at the beach, you were in Hawaii, now you’re in Austin, you’re a waitress, life sucks’, basically. And it was so scary.”“It was like a horror movie, so much time underwater, it was just so violent what was happening, the beating in my body and the lack of oxygen. I truly was one inch from dying. I really felt: OK, the next moment I’m going to be on the other side. It was OK, I was peaceful about it. In a way I wanted it to end because I was feeling really bad, I just wanted the peacefulness.”But she did not seek treatment: “I didn’t get hit, I’m breathing, that’s all I need,” she thought. Then the waves in Nelscott were higher than she expected.“That’s when the terror started to creep in, I was very nervous, very uncomfortable in the water. A 35ft wave, nowhere to go, that’s the moment where you have to ditch your board and e as much as you can, go under the wave. I freaked out, that’s when I think the PTSD came, I froze, I saw the wave and I just didn’t do anything and it just took me,“ she says.“It hits me underwater with the lip of the wave - imagine a 35ft wave bringing a 10ft board that’s like a table, into my forehead. I got hit, I felt a quick in-and-out, black stars, pulled my inflatable vest. When I went black, I was like, come back – because if you don’t come back right now, you go.”Daniel Amen, a doctor in California who has treated numerous surfers, including Maidana and Dollar, often finds they have frontal lobe brain injuries which affect judgment and impulse control.“The surfer of a 30ft wave has to be incredibly coordinated and make split-second decisions well, now they’re not quite so good and it means they’re more likely to get another concussion because in their heads they’re going ‘I can do this’ but their processor isn’t reacting as it should,” he says.Maidana hopes her experience will raise awareness of the perils of big-wave surfing. Dollar suspects a culture shift will be hard to achieve. “I don’t think helmets are going to make a difference, I think it’s about surfers being aware that when they take off on a giant close-out wave just for, like, a photo, they could suffer brain damage from that wipeout,” he says.“When I talk to the younger guys they’re aware of what I went through and they’re asking questions like how can they prevent it themselves, how can they take care of themselves, what have they got to do. At the end of the day they’re still all charging really hard and getting hurt constantly. There’s an awareness out there but there isn’t really a change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7692a93c3c94af11f2c813678cffa5d0016a32a/0_130_4194_2516/master/4194.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2fcb7a48c66a5bcd9215c35655787f8","title":"nick kyrgios comes out firing before easing past antoine hoang at us open","story":"Nick Kyrgios courted more controversy at the US Open before his second-round match against Antoine Hoang had begun.The Australian, already in hot water this week for calling the ATP ‘pretty corrupt’, was told to fold his collar down because the motto written underneath it, “Just Do You”, apparently contravened the rules.Kyrgios called the match supervisor and asked what the rule was. “I’m not going to play until you show me the rule,” he told the supervisor. “I want to know the rule. I want to see the rule. I’ve seen shirts worse.”He also had another of his familiar tantrums in the third set after the umpire allowed a Hoang challenge having previously called game.The 24-year-old demanded the supervisor came back onto the court to explain that rule as well.The 24-year-old was later told he could display the logo in future matches at Flushing Meadows.He defeated French wildcard 6-4, 6-2, 6-4, and will next meet Andrey Rublev of Russia.

Moments earlier his arms had been spread wide on the back of a sofa so I could see the Olympic rings and the words Beijing 2008 and London 2012 tattooed into his skin in honour of the two gold medals he won as an amateur. They are a reminder that Lomachenko has one of the greatest records in the history of amateur boxing – having won 396 fights and lost just one.He is now regarded widely as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the professional game. Last year, in only his 12th pro contest, he won his third world title at a different weight. No other fighter in boxing history had become a three-ision champion so quickly. His long list of achievements are matched by the superlatives which follow almost every Lomachenko fight. His dazzling footwork and technique, combined with the exquisite geometry of his ringcraft and the venom in his fists, mean that Lomachenko is unlike any other fighter in boxing today.But even the 31-year-old Ukrainian is not immune to boxing’s deadly realities. Steeling himself for his WBC, WBA and WBO world lightweight fight against Luke Campbell on Saturday at the O2 Arena , Lomachenko’s relaxed mood becomes serious.He lowers his elbows on to the table and rests his chin on his fists as he remembers his friend, Maxim Dadashev, who died last month after a world title eliminator in Maryland.Dadashev was not some no-hoper or washed-up journeyman. Rather, he was an unbeaten prospect who stepped into the ring against Subriel Matias, a Puerto Rican light-welterweight. Dadashev and Matias mirrored each other with their perfect 13-0 records.But the fight soon tilted in favour of Matias and Dadashev suffered a systematic beating. Buddy McGirt, the experienced American trainer in Dadashev’s corner, had already decided at the end of the 11th round that he was going to stop the bout. But, out of respect for his fighter, he asked Dadashev for permission to throw in the towel.“You’re getting hit too much, Max,” McGirt urged. “Please let me do this, please?”Dadashev did not agree but, just before the bell for the last round, McGirt waved the fight over.After he fell ill in his dressing room, Dadashev was rushed to hospital. Emergency surgery attempted to relieve the pressure caused by a subdural hematoma on his brain and Dadashev was placed in a medically-induced coma. He died four days later, on 23 July.“For me it was a big shock,” Lomachenko says as, sitting next to Egil Klimas, his manager, he becomes more reflective. “Max was doing very well as a boxer. So when he finished the fight I called Egil and asked: ‘How is Max?’ It was then I heard Max went to the hospital. We were all very worried and over the next few days I was in touch all the time. But afterwards I was very shocked.”Did the distressing news make Lomachenko think more deeply about the consequences of boxing and the possibility of not fighting again?Lomachenko is about to answer when Klimas asks, softly: “Can we change the subject?”I can see how upset Klimas looks, because he also managed Dadashev, and so it seems right to switch tack. But it is striking that, when I ask Lomachenko if he feels fear before a fight, he offers a layered answer. “No. I always stay in focus and go in the ring very calm. But before a fight I am nervous. I don’t show you this. But of course I’m nervous. Every athlete has this feeling…”Lomachenko talks to Klimas in Ukrainian as they try to find the right words.“You don’t feel comfortable,” Klimas says in English as he describes the unsettling emotions Lomachenko and Campbell will experience as they wait for the lonely hours to pass before they walk to the ring.It explains why Lomachenko insists he will not underestimate the British fighter who also won Olympic gold at London 2012. Asked if the fact that Campbell is bigger and taller, with a longer reach, will present his most obvious difficulties, Lomachenko reacts calmly. “We’ll see. But I prepare for this. I prepare with a guy who is twice as big as Luke Campbell. But nobody knows for sure until the fight starts.”In his last bout, against another English boxer in Anthony Crolla, Lomachenko was imperious and ruthless. Crolla looked like he was bent on survival until, in the fourth round, he finally tried to engage with Lomachenko. The Mancunian said later that it was the worst thing he could have done – because he was immediately dropped and stopped.Campbell will be more ambitious but the bookmakers and most boxing insiders regard Lomachenko as the runaway favourite. A few voices disagree. George Groves, the former world champion super-middleweight, says that Lomachenko is the best fighter he has ever seen live – and yet he suggests that Campbell will shock everyone and win. Campbell is trained by Shane McGuigan, who also used to be in Groves’s corner. Yet, even when friendship is set aside, Campbell is a very good boxer.Jorge Linares, their one common opponent, said this week that, if he uses his long reach, “Campbell has a great chance of winning, and don’t be shocked if he puts Lomachenko down like I did”.Boxing News, the British trade publication, described Campbell’s challenge in more pessimistic language: “Facing the Impossible.”Even Lomachenko is not invincible. He grins sheepishly when asked how it felt, 15 months ago, after Linares dropped him in the sixth – before Lomachenko forced a 10th round TKO. “I was surprised. Because before I go down I think: ‘Oh, a couple more minutes and I finish this fight.’ I saw the win already and that’s when he got me. But I got up and I start from the beginning. Then I finished it.”Despite Lomachenko’s impressive amateur record, I am more intrigued by his lone defeat in 397 fights. At the world championships in Chicago, in 2007, he lost a close decision to Russia’s Albert Selimov. “It was painful because I was undefeated. I don’t know how many fights I’d had by then. Two hundred? It was a lot and I won them all. I was young and had a very big ambition. But this loss gave me a big push. After it was over I thought: ‘Hey, one more year to the Olympics. You need to be very serious.’ So it was almost good for me to lose.’In the opening round at the Beijing Olympics, Lomachenko faced Selimov again. The result was a formality. Lomachenko avenged his lone defeat and went on to win his first gold medal. Another Olympic title in 2012 set him up for a lucrative career in the US and, a year later in his second pro fight, he fought for the world featherweight title. He faced Orlando Salido, a tough champion who had fought 55 times previously as a professional. Salido could not make weight and came in over the featherweight limit. He also landed numerous low blows while winning a split decision over Lomachenko.I liked the fact that Lomachenko did not make any excuses. Since then he has become a world champion at featherweight, super-feather and lightweight and so he can look back at his loss against Salido philosophically. “That fight was my problem. It wasn’t the judge’s problem, my camp, my manager, my promoter. It was just my problem. He was the champion but people who understand boxing will understand the small nuance.”The Ukrainian acknowledges boxing’s capacity for surprises and the fact that all fighters are vulnerable. So he was not shocked when Anthony Joshua was beaten by Andy Ruiz Jr this summer. “No, because I know Ruiz’s style. He has good experience and he is a very smart boxer with fast hands. I was definitely not surprised.”It sounds as if Lomachenko might have picked Ruiz, who is also based in California, even before Joshua imploded in one of the biggest upsets in recent years? “No. I thought Joshua would win. But I knew Ruiz would give him a very hard fight.”Who will win the rematch in December? “Nobody knows because it all depends how they are preparing.” Lomachenko is much more certain when asked if Oleksandr Usyk, his close friend and fellow Ukrainian, can become a world heavyweight champion. “Absolutely,” Lomachenko exclaims of Usyk, a former undisputed cruiserweight world champion and 2018’s Fighter of the Year, who makes his heavyweight debut in October. At London 2012, Usyk won the heavyweight gold medal while Joshua was the super-heavyweight Olympic champion.“We had a very good party in London,” Lomachenko says of Usyk, “and good memories.”As the years slip away, and even a boxer as great as Lomachenko contemplates the end, he savours a return to the scene of his greatest Olympic triumph. “I love London. It’s a very beautiful city. Very interesting and unusual buildings. Look at the architecture.”The master boxer gestures to the London skyline gleaming in the late summer sunshine near the O2. Lomachenko then leans forward intently. “I am so happy to be here because I know that people from the UK understand boxing. They are very special fans and will make an incredible atmosphere on Saturday. In the first part they will be cheering Campbell and maybe booing me.”Lomachenko smiles again and all the hurt of remembering his lost friend, Maxim Dadashev, slips back into the shadows. “I think in the second part of the fight they are going to stop booing and will start cheering me. This is what makes them special. They love boxing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/025523d0fb1556b643f8ff89a10354607f4d1f84/909_479_1548_929/master/1548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8897a7d5df0790539144295e1213cf41","title":"when chase is on his computer he feels like any other nine year old","story":"Nikki Hunter-Pike explains how accessibility technology has opened up the online world to her son, who has cerebral palsyIt’s Saturday morning at Nikki Hunter-Pike’s home. While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Computer software is essential to her dual career, writes  Sue George“Teaching yoga, hosting yoga brunch events and doing a full-time finance contract is pretty tiring,” says Jemma Ralston, “but it is so exciting because I am in control. All these things I am choosing to do. Yoga is my passion.”Ralston teaches ashtanga vinyasa yoga in classes across London and – alongside her new yoga business – she also works as an accountant.Ralston has a condition called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) that leads to problems with blood clotting, causing easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence. These things are here to help everyone.“I can accept my body as not perfect – but no one’s is,” she continues. “We all have our limitations and have things we can excel at. It’s about appreciating what you can do.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

These 10 examples have become part of everyone’s lives Much has been said about building inclusivity into technology, processes and all aspects of life. But what you might not realise is that helping people with disabilities drove development of some of our most impressive technology, now mainstream and widely used. As Esther McVey, the then-secretary of state for work and pensions, argued at Microsoft Future Decoded 2018: “When technology is designed to be assistive, it can become technology for everyone.”From Segways to wearables, here are 10 examples of accessibility tech that has gone on to change everyone’s lives.CeefaxIt has been seven years since the BBC switched off Ceefax. The teletext service was adored by millions and became the port of call for checking football scores on Saturday afternoons. But Ceefax actually came about 38 years earlier by complete accident.In 1974, engineers at the BBC were exploring ways to provide deaf people with subtitles and discovered that the unused part of the 625-line television signal could be used to send messages and information – and thus Ceefax, or “see facts”, was born.Gesture recognitionPinch-to-zoom and three-finger swipes to the right and left are just a couple of the trackpad gestures Windows 10 laptop users will be familiar with.The company arguably responsible for bringing gesture recognition devices to the mass market was Fingerworks. One of its lead engineers, Wayne Westerman, was inspired by a temporary disability – a bout of tendonitis. He found that using touch-sensitive technology helped to relieve his symptoms and believed it would do the same for others.Speech-to-textThanks to the proliferation of smartphone technology, dictation and speech-to-text capabilities have seen a broad uptake in use.But before speech-to-text became universally popular for dictation purposes, it was helping people who are quadriplegic or those with conditions such as multiple sclerosis to carry out tasks on their computers using voice commands. Helping a large set of users take advantage of the technology has been made possible because of companies such as Microsoft. The tech giant has been focused on bringing the software to a broad audience for years, having released its first speech API in 1995. Now its speech-recognition software, Dictation, will interpret users’ spoken words in eight languages, including English, Spanish and Japanese, and is widely available across the Office suite.Text-to-speechFinding your way around an unfamiliar city in a vehicle and receiving real-time traffic updates while on the road wouldn’t be possible if it weren’t for voice-guided navigation – or, more specifically, speech synthesis.Screen readers are a rudimentary form of speech synthesis technology and Windows-Eyes has been a software of choice for people who are blind or visually impaired since the mid-1990s. It enables computer users to access the various programs of a Windows operating system by converting text into speech. The technology is advancing to such a degree AI is now helping visually impaired people identify everything from friends and family to menu items. Microsoft’s Seeing AI app analyses pictures as well as text and describes them out loud. So it’s not just tech to stop you from taking a wrong turn.Keyboard usabilityThe layout of the qwerty keyboard is so familiar, you can probably type without looking – that’s no coincidence.Keyboard usability can be traced back to the early 19th century, when Italian inventor Pellegrino Turri created a mechanical typing machine and what’s thought to be the first typewriter. According to history books, a close friend of his was losing their sight and he wanted to find a way to keep in contact without having to dictate to a scribe. In order to use the machine, they had to rely on their sense of touch.SegwaysThese two-wheeled electric vehicles are a preferred mode of transport for many enthusiastic tourists looking to see the most Instagrammable sites across a host of European cities. They’ve been so popular with tourists that they’ve actually had to be banned in parts of Barcelona and Prague.The earliest incarnation of the Segway wasn’t intended for the helmet-wearing hordes, however. After witnessing a wheelchair user struggling to mount a kerb, Dean Kamen came up with iBot – a self-balancing mobility system that uses gyroscopic techniques to negotiate steps and uneven surfaces.Self-driving vehiclesOwning a driverless car may once have been like a storyline from The Jetsons, but rapid advances in technology have made it a tangible reality.In 2012, Steve Mahan, who is legally blind, became the first person to be taken for a ride in a driverless vehicle on a public road. This highlights how people with disabilities are likely to be key beneficiaries of driverless vehicles, even if the technology wasn’t explicitly designed for them.Eye-gazingThe ability to track the gaze of your eyes is becoming popular among gamers, who in some instances are now able to integrate this into their favourite game-play scenarios. It is allowing greater and easier interaction with the gaming environment, for example changing the direction of the camera so users can “peer around a corner” without their character moving.But eye-gazing has nobler origins it was initially used by people with conditions such as cerebral palsy and locked-in syndrome to communicate. By simply looking at a screen, users were able to select words and construct sentences. Former NFL player Steve Gleason was the inspiration for Microsoft’s eye-control tech in 2014, when he challenged the company to develop a solution for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It went so well that three years later built-in eye-tracking support was added to Windows 10.WearablesWearable technology is changing how you can interact with the world around you, and it is even augmenting reality.Approximately 15 years before smart glasses went on sale to the public, neuroscientist Paul Bach-y-Rita developed a device to enable those who are blind to “see” with their tongue. Today, the technology is sold as BrainPort: a pair of glasses with a small camera attached. A wire transmits visual input from the camera to a piece that users place on their tongue – light is converted into electrical impulses that then stimulate the tongue instead of the retina, creating a tactile image that the person wearing the device can use to navigate their surroundings.Brain recordingSome of the latest wearable technology on the market offers to measure your brain activity and alert you when your concentration drops.Back in 2006, brain-recording devices were being developed for home use for people unable to move or speak. A cap wired with electrodes recording signals from the brain enabled the person wearing it to select choices on a screen simply by thinking about them.Clearly when technology is built with accessibility in mind, it ends up being beneficial to all. The powerful message that these 10 pieces of tech, and countless others that you will be using every day, convey is that accessibility shouldn’t be an afterthought. In fact disability is often a lens for innovation. This is Microsoft’s view, which – along with resell partner John Lewis \u0026amp Partners – is operating with a vision to empower everyone with its accessibility updates on Office 365 and Windows 10.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Donald Trump issued a video Thursday warning that the storm “could be an absolute monster”.The National Weather Service said Dorian, which was building strength east of the Bahamas, would become a major hurricane on Friday afternoon. The winds from the storm were expected to arrive on the Florida coast on Sunday morning, in the middle of the Labor Day holiday weekend.If Dorian lands as a Category 4 storm, it could be the most powerful hurricane to affect the east coast of Florida since Hurricane Andrew roared ashore in 1992, causing devastating damage and killing 65 people.In 2004, Hurricane Frances arrived in Florida as a Category 2 hurricane, killed 37 in Florida and wreaked damage costing billions.Trump has canceled his forthcoming trip this weekend to Poland as the storm approaches. Millions of Floridians on Friday were stockpiling water, food, fuel and materials such as plywood to board up properties. They have been advised to track the storm closely.Florida has called 2,500 National Guard troops into action and put a further 1,500 on stand-by as the hurricane spins off the south-western shore, roaring north-west towards the Bahamas and strengthening overnight into Friday, with winds of 105mph and gusts up to 125mph.On Friday morning it was a category 2 hurricane out in the ocean and is fully expected to be category 4 when it makes landfall, indicating winds over 130mph.It was announced on Thursday that the vice-president, Mike Pence, will travel to Poland in the president’s stead. Meanwhile, Puerto Rico’s citizens breathed a sigh of relief this week at having avoided major damage from Hurricane Dorian, after it had been on a path this week to hit the US island territory directly.DeSantis urged residents to take precautionary measures including stockpiling water, canned food and other emergency supplies.“Dorian could be a major hurricane,” DeSantis tweeted. “All Floridians on the east coast should have seven days of supplies, prepare their homes and follow the track closely.”Georgia, another state potentially in the storm’s path, also declared a state of emergency for 12 counties nearest the state’s coastline.Governor Brian Kemp said the storm “has the potential to produce catastrophic impacts to citizens” throughout the south-east coastal region of the United States.One predicted track has the storm on course to hit Palm Beach county in southern Florida, the location of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. According to the Tampa Bay Times the president’s ocean-front property, often referred to as “the winter White House”, lies within the so called “cone of uncertainty”– the potential range of paths the hurricane could take.There were lines at many gas stations in south Florida as people began filling gas cans and topping off their gas tanks. Some residents using community Facebook groups gave updates on new shipments of water to restock the nearly empty shelves at local grocery stores.Meanwhile the state’s largest power company, Florida Power and Light, said it had activated an emergency response plan in anticipation of the storm’s impact, securing around 13,000 employees and additional personnel to respond to damaged powerlines and equipment.DeSantis said he had spoken on the phone with Trump, who pledged support.The hurricane center advised that heavy rains from the storm were expected to occur over portions of the Bahamas, Florida, and elsewhere in the south-eastern US “later this week and into early next week”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c61133ea7a1efac79a542f381729132a5c841ab/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=284e261f6f7afb4c60bf32107628a78e","title":"german elections afd finds rich seam in city clinging on to coal","story":"Far-right party insists it is pro-women as it attacks government’s green agenda before regional pollsIn the 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Doreen Mohaupt has experienced the downsides and the upsides of German reunification.Born in the coal-rich Lusatia Lake District close to the Polish border, the 43-year-old was raised in an area that was once the pride of the socialist East German economy, employing about 80,000 workers.For Mohaupt, however, the structural upheaval that followed the cold war was a challenge she came to relish. An urban planner employed by the city of Cottbus, she now leads a team of 37 civil servants focused on regenerating the area.“Of course, everyone’s natural instinct is that they don’t like change,” she said. “But I think the attitudes of my generation of East Germans are different, especially among women. I sometimes feel we are like these amoeba that can always adjust to their surroundings.”But it is the voting intentions of many of the men left behind by the collapse of the coal industry that is likely to dominate Sunday’s regional elections, which could result in the rightwing populists Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) becoming the area’s largest party. Deindustrialisation has left a generation of men feeling emasculated, angry and open to the policy messages of the far right.With Germany moving toward phasing out coal power by 2038, the Cottbus area is facing the loss of a further 20,000 to 22,000 jobs directly and indirectly linked to the mining sector.In Brandenburg and Saxony, the AfD has realistic hopes of toppling the centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD) and centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) as the strongest force.It has been forecast to triple its vote since 2014 in Cottbus, largely because the party has recalibrated its anti-immigration message toward railing against the government’s green agenda.“Coal is Lusatia’s last anchor,” said Marianne Spring-Räumschüssel, the AfD’s candidate for the region. “We need industry, because without industry there won’t be jobs in administration either.” Her party opposes the phase-out altogether, and she said she mistrusted the government’s promise to cushion job losses with €40bn in structural funds for hard-hit regions.“People in East Germany can read between the lines,” said Spring-Räumschüssel, whose party’s campaign slogan, Vollende die Wende – “complete the peaceful revolution” - controversially co-opts the language of the 1989 dissident movement. “We knew back then that those on the top weren’t being truthful with us, and now I’ve got a feeling that they aren’t being truthful with us either”.But Spring-Räumschüssel’s own story shows how some workers in declining industries have been able to adapt and thrive. Once a sales manager in the area’s other major industry, textiles, she benefited from several local grassroots initiatives aimed at building infrastructure for women to retrain and find a political voice. One such initiative set up was East Germany’s first all-female list of independent candidates, which kickstarted her career in politics.Although the AfD has the lowest proportion of female MPs among any party in the Bundestag and adheres to what she calls a “traditional image of the family”, Spring-Räumschüssel said her party still honoured women’s issues, largely through its stance on immigration.The 2015 refugee crisis, she said, had brought an influx of people into Germany who came from countries with “lower levels of education” and more traditional views of the role of women. “I am a woman’s libber through and through, you can see that. I don’t want to see my granddaughter become a housewife again.” When it comes to women’s rights, Spring-Räumschüssel said she did not “want us to be dragged back to the middle ages” by refugees.Other people who were also involved in projects intended to help women retrain following the collapse of the textile industry disagree with that negative portrayal of refugees. On Thiemstrasse, south of Cottbus’ central station, Hanka Lindner runs the “purple villa”, a women’s centre founded 30 years ago to offer support and retraining for former textile workers.“The centre has always been driven by the idea that we must not wallow in our misery,” said the 59-year-old. “When you are down in the dumps, you have to find a way out again.”There were increasing calls for a similar centre for the men left behind by the coal phase-out, said Lindner. “There is clearly an interest, but men can be their own worst enemy. They find it harder to support each other, and they only tend to seek professional help at the eleventh hour.”Cottbus’ purple villa has changed its focus in recent years to offer support networks for women among the roughly 4,000 refugees who have moved to the city since 2015. “In my experience, the conflicts between men and women you find in Syrian families are not that different to the ones we have in German families,” Lindner said.It was initially Syrian men who attended language courses offered in the city, but women were increasingly seeking advice, she said. “Many of them come to us because they want to work. The number of orces has gone up. And Syrian women are a lot keener on seeking a conversation with German women than men are.”Lindner said she was unsure what the rise of the AfD would mean for her centre. “In the last few weeks I have started to wonder myself what will happen to us,. I have never had to think twice about the political consequences of what I say. That’s a new experience for me.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoCommon sense has broken out\u0026rsquo, High Court told after hearing protesters consent to restrictionsUS vice president could land in Shannon as early as MondayCeremony in St Mel\u0026rsquos Cathedral told \u0026lsquoCiar\u0026aacuten is with God and God is very near\u0026rsquoRathbeggan Family Adventure Centre to shut its doors after 21 years on SundayWeather warning issued for 10 counties with up to 50mm expected in some placesCocaine, Ketamine, LSD and MDMA found by garda\u0026iacute at festivalSuspected ammunition seized by PSNI terrorism investigation unitEdward Bransfield had the first confirmed sighting of the polar continentBoris Johnson\u0026rsquos government has put forward nothing credible, says T\u0026aacutenaisteHigher-education construction schemes to generate 14,000 more places when completeJim Walsh and Hammy Hammond honoured for dedicationGovernment proposal will require childminders to undergo training and Garda vettingNumber hits record high amid greater awareness and online access to exam scriptsCouncil makes new attempt to develop project labelled a \u0026lsquowhite elephant\u0026rsquo by ex-mayorFormer president to be nominated for post held by her predecessor at the \u0026AacuterasIn a town with a young population, the lack of investment in youth services is an issueNorth Dublin town is facing issues with runaway growth, integration, and facilitiesPBP calls for \u0026lsquounified action\u0026rsquo on housing and climate change in letter to parties and unions\u0026lsquoTo see them all going off now is just amazing.

Photograph: VlietiStockIt’s undoubtedly going to be one of those “where were you?” moments. And already almost 10,000 people in the Netherlands have decided: on October 31st, irrespective of the weather, they’ll be at a giant beach party, facing across the North Sea, with a band playing We’ll Meet Again.The idea of a huge European “Bye, Bye Britain” party in Wijk aan Zee, a quiet seaside village west of Amsterdam best known for its annual chess tournament, started as a bit of a joke – until suddenly it went viral on Facebook. Now, says one of the organisers, film maker Ron Toekook, it’s caught the imagination. “Because so many Dutch people live in apartments, there’s a tradition here: you take your deck chair and a bottle of wine and go to the beach to watch the sun setting. Everyone does it. We love it.”The plan is for plenty of European food and drink – French wine, German beer, Dutch cheese, Belgian fries, Italian pasta, even Austrian strudel – to remind the Brits what they’re giving up, all to be consumed against a soundscape of nostalgic tunes from the previous Battle of Britain.“We’ll fall asleep to the sound of the waves,” says Toekook. “When we wake up, the UK will have cut itself off from the Continent, and we’ll be ready to go to the aid of the boats full of pro-Europeans.”If that seems a surprisingly unruffled way to mark a cross-channel parting that could hurt their economy badly – a no-deal Brexit could cost the Netherlands €34 billion up to 2030, or €164 a year per citizen, according to the research bureau SEO – that’s because the Dutch are even more uncertain about Brexit and its implications than the British and Irish are.Gains and lossesOn the one hand, they’re being told that Amsterdam, in particular, is “hoovering up” jobs – such as the 900 at the European Medicines Agency – at firms that are abandoning the UK and others that are opting not to go there. On the other, they’re being warned about the impact on the 200,000 Dutch jobs tied directly to trade with the UK.The problem is that both are true. As to the balance, the country is in “wait and see mode”, says deputy mayor of Amsterdam Udo Kock. And the figures? According to the Dutch foreign investment agency NFIA, 60 foreign companies and institutions brought about 2,500 Brexit-related jobs to the Netherlands in 2018, increasing the total number of Brexit-related companies Amsterdam has notched up so far to 98.Another 325 companies – “including some big names”, says the NFIA coyly – have made detailed inquiries that are being taken seriously.On the down side, the UK is the third biggest export destination for Dutch goods after Germany and Belgium, buying €40 billion worth every year, a huge 9.2 per cent of total overseas trade. A “hard” Brexit, with a reversion to WTO rules, would mean an increase of €628 million a year in administrative fees alone, say KPMG. At its starkest, according to the IMF, a no-deal Brexit would mean a drop of 0.7 per cent in Dutch GDP. Only Ireland with an eye-watering fall of four per cent would be worse affected.The biggest potential flashpoint will be Rotterdam, Europe’s largest port and the third-busiest in the world. It’s doing its best to plan. It has employed 300 more customs officers. It has cleared parking space for 200 trucks to minimise waiting time for new permits. Black boxBut while the terms of Britain’s departure remain in doubt, it’s impossible to model what will actually happen, only scenarios based on possible outcomes. “How things will work on the British side, in particular, is still a black box,” admits the port’s chief executive, Allard Castelein. In the end though, the figures are beside the point, says Dutch finance minister Wopke Hoekstra, formerly a consultant with McKinsey – and he’s right.“In principle, Brexit is bad for the Netherlands, it’s bad for Europe and – I am certain – it will turn out bad for the UK as well. In fact, the only countries who’ll see it as a good thing geopolitically are China and Russia, because it will lead to a weaker, more ided, Europe.”It’s a sign of the times that one wonders for a second why Hoekstra didn’t mention the US and Donald Trump in the same breath as China and Russia – before remembering that America is the Netherlands’ sixth-largest trading partner.

Photograph: Patrick McMullan via Getty ImagesHaley Robson was a 16-year-old South Florida high school student when an acquaintance from school approached her at a local pool with an intriguing offer: Did she want to make extra money giving massages to a billionaire in Palm Beach?She agreed. When Jeffrey Epstein tried to grope her while she was giving him a massage in nothing but a thong, she brushed his hand away, Robson said in a 2009 deposition for a civil case. But she continued to visit Epstein’s mansion dozens more times, in a lucrative new role: a recruiter of other teenage girls from her school.“I didn’t have to convince them,” she said in the deposition. “I proposed to them. They took it.”A review by The New York Times of lawsuits, unsealed court records and depositions, along with new interviews, offers disturbing allegations about how this small cadre of women helped Epstein lure girls into his orbit and managed the logistics of his encounters with them.The urgency of the investigation into Epstein’s associates was underscored on Tuesday when about two dozen women offered searing accounts of how he had sexually abused them before a packed courtroom in Manhattan.The judge overseeing the case had invited the women to speak at a hearing to dismiss the indictment against Epstein in light of his death.Several of the women implored federal prosecutors to continue investigating the women in Epstein’s inner circle.“Jeffrey is no longer here, and the women that helped him are,” said Teresa Helm, who said she was recruited into Epstein’s world 17 years ago. “They definitely need to be held accountable for helping him, helping themselves, helping one another carry on this huge – almost like – system.”The US attorney for the Southern District of New York, Geoffrey S Berman, whose office brought the charges against Epstein, said after his suicide that the investigation into the sex-trafficking conspiracy was not finished and prosecutors were committed to standing up for the “brave young women” Epstein had abused.One of the women under scrutiny, Epstein’s one-time girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been accused in several well-publicised lawsuits of overseeing efforts to procure girls and young women for him, a charge she has firmly denied.But Epstein is also accused in civil suits of relying on an organised network of underlings: those who trained girls how to sexually pleasure him office assistants who booked cars and travel and recruiters who ensured he always had a fresh supply of teenage girls at the ready.None of Epstein’s associates have been charged or named as co-conspirators in Manhattan. But federal authorities are eyeing possible charges that include sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy, the two people with knowledge of the investigation said.Four women were apparently so instrumental to Epstein’s operation that they were named as possible “co-conspirators” and were granted immunity from prosecution in a widely criticised plea bargain Epstein struck with federal prosecutors in Florida more than a decade ago. That deal allowed Epstein to plead guilty to state charges and to spend 13 months in a county jail rather than face a federal sex-trafficking indictment.The four women – Sarah Kellen, Lesley Groff, Adriana Ross and Nadia Marcinkova – could still be subject to criminal charges in New York. The US attorney’s office has said it is not bound by the Florida agreement.‘The boss’Three women have alleged in lawsuits that Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring operated as a hierarchy, with the financier and Ghislaine Maxwell at the top.“She orchestrated the whole thing for Jeffrey,” Sarah Ransome, who sued Maxwell and other associates in 2017, said in an interview.Maxwell, the daughter of British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell, was Epstein’s longtime companion, managing his homes and introducing him to many of the politicians, celebrities and dignitaries who became fixtures within his social circle.“They were like partners in business,” Janusz Banasiak, Epstein’s house manager, said in a deposition. Epstein’s butler, Alfredo Rodriguez, described Maxwell in a deposition as “the boss”.Maxwell has vehemently denied she trafficked girls. Neither Maxwell nor her lawyers responded to requests for interviews for this article.But Epstein’s accusers contend in court papers that Maxwell managed the network of recruiters and helped devise the playbook for how to lure young women into Epstein’s web.Recruiters were allegedly told to target young, financially desperate women, and to promise them help furthering their education and careers, these civil complaints said.Virginia Roberts Giuffre said in a deposition that she was 16 when she met Maxwell and was recruited as a masseuse. She said she remembered Maxwell’s sales pitch: If she gave a wealthy man a massage, a whole world of opportunity would open to her.“If the guy likes you, then, you know, it will work out for you,” Giuffre, in a deposition, recalled Maxwell telling her. “You’ll travel. You’ll make good money. You’ll be educated.”Giuffre took the job. Soon, she said, she became Epstein’s “sex slave”, not only providing sexual favours to him but also to some of his acquaintances, including politicians and prominent businessmen.“My whole life revolved around just pleasing these men and keeping Ghislaine and Jeffrey happy,” she said in the deposition. “Their whole entire lives revolved around sex.”The ‘lieutenant’Just below Maxwell in the chain of command was Sarah Kellen, another high-ranking employee, who has been accused in multiple lawsuits of scheduling girls to have sex with Epstein in his Palm Beach mansion.She was called the “lieutenant” in one lawsuit. David Rodgers, Epstein’s pilot, said in a deposition that Kellen was “like an assistant to Ghislaine”.Kellen kept the names and numbers of all the girls who gave Epstein erotic massages, according to Palm Beach police reports and Robson’s deposition. She would call them whenever Epstein was in town, asking the girls if they were ready to “work,” the reports and Robson said.“She saw herself as the boss,” said Spencer T Kuvin, a West Palm Beach lawyer who represented several accusers in lawsuits. “Sarah was really running that organisation, bringing girls and getting them in and out of the Palm Beach home.”Kellen, who sometimes goes by Sarah Kensington or Sarah Vickers, did not respond to requests for an interview. Her lawyers also did not respond to requests for comment.Multiple girls told Palm Beach detectives that when they arrived at Epstein’s mansion, Kellen would escort them upstairs to Epstein’s bedroom and lay out the massage table with the various oils and lotions that they were to use on him, according to police reports.In an interview, Ransome said Kellen and Maxwell also gave her tips on how to give Epstein erotic massages, including how to rub his feet and best satisfy him sexually. “It was Ghislaine and Sarah Kellen that showed me how to please Jeffrey,” Ransome said.The assistantsLesley Groff, Epstein’s executive assistant for almost 20 years, was one of the possible co-conspirators named in the 2008 plea deal Epstein’s lawyers worked out with the US attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida.She said in a 2005 interview with the New York Times that she answered Epstein’s telephone and managed his schedule, which included meetings with prominent scientists, Wall Street executives, foreign dignitaries and US politicians.Over the years, she said in 2005, she formed a special bond with the financier, anticipating his needs. “I know what he is thinking,” she said at the time.But Ransome said in her lawsuit that Groff, now 53, also arranged travel and lodging for the seemingly endless stream of adolescent girls and young women who provided Epstein with erotic massages.In a recent interview with the Times, Ransome said Groff communicated directly with her, repeating Epstein’s promises to help her obtain a fashion degree. Groff’s lawyer, Michael Bachner, said his client worked as part of a professional staff, making appointments, taking messages and setting up meetings.“At no time during Lesley’s employment with Epstein did she ever engage in any misconduct and never knowingly made travel arrangements for anyone under 18,” Bachner said.Ransome also alleged in her lawsuit that she was instructed by Epstein’s associates to go on a diet and to lose about 11 pounds to maintain her slim figure. In one email exchange reviewed by the Times, Ransome told Groff she was monitoring her weight for Epstein.“Please could you also let him know that I am now 57kg and that everything is going well,” Ransome emailed Groff in 2007.Another of Epstein’s assistants, Adriana Ross, was also named as a potential co-conspirator in the 2008 plea deal. When Palm Beach police were investigating Epstein around 2005, Ross removed three computers from the Florida mansion, Banasiak, the house manager, said in a deposition.The police noted in their reports that the computers, which they had reason to think might contain photos of naked girls, were missing when investigators arrived.“She show up one day with gentleman,” Banasiak said. “And she told me that they are moving out those computers.”Ross, who went on to study accounting and is based in Miami, did not respond to calls or emails seeking comment.‘The more you do, the more you make’Nadia Marcinkova, a former model and pilot, had come under police scrutiny in Palm Beach in 2005. A 16-year-old told detectives she was giving Epstein a massage when Marcinkova entered the room naked, according to Palm Beach police reports.Epstein then told the girl she could make an extra $200 if she performed oral sex on Marcinkova, and the girl reluctantly agreed, the reports said.That encounter was the first of many sexual trysts the teenager told police she was coerced into having with both Marcinkova and Epstein at his Palm Beach mansion, according to a police incident report.Police records also show that investigators had indications that Marcinkova might have been underage herself when she became involved with Epstein.Marcinkova, who later used the last name Marcinko, declined to answer questions about Epstein’s alleged abuse of girls when she was deposed in a lawsuit, invoking the Fifth Amendment.Reached by the Times, Marcinkova’s lawyers, Erica T Dubno and Aaron Mysliwiec, said “like other victims, Nadia Marcinko is and has been severely traumatised” and “needs time to process and make sense of what she has been through before she is able to speak out”.Prosecutors may face thorny legal issues in deciding whether to charge some of Epstein’s associates, like Robson and Marcinkova, who may have initially been victims themselves.Determining criminal liability is always a complex decision if a person has been exploited for sex, then used as a pawn to recruit others, said Lauren Hersh, a former sex-trafficking prosecutor in Brooklyn who now leads World Without Exploitation, an anti-trafficking organisation.“But for their own exploitation, they wouldn’t do that,” she said. “It becomes really, really tricky.”Robson, a former stripper and Olive Garden worker, was not among the four women given immunity in the Florida plea agreement. But her role in Epstein’s operation was significant enough that Palm Beach Police detectives had planned to charge her more than a decade ago, according to an affidavit by the lead detective in Palm Beach.She was also sued twice, and she described her role in Epstein’s operation in a deposition.When Epstein would fly into Florida, Robson said she would get a call on her cell phone from Kellen, who would tell her how many massages the financier needed for the upcoming visit. The two of them would hammer out logistics.“I would have a girl that would be available for those dates and times,” Robson said in a 2009 deposition. Robson told lawyers she made $200 for every high school girl she brought to the Palm Beach mansion. She recruited the girls from her high school, including one who was 14. When she brought a 23-year-old, Epstein balked. Too old, he told her.The girls knew what they were getting into, Robson said. The rules were unspoken, but understood.“The more you do, the more you make,” Robson said in the deposition. “If you were topless, if you were working in your thong, your bra, you’re going to make more than a hundred.”Reached by the Times, Robson said, “I have nothing to say. I would appreciate if I was not contacted.”Douglas McIntosh, a lawyer who represented her in a civil case in Florida, called Robson “a lovely young lady”, but declined to answer questions about her involvement with Epstein.In her deposition, Robson said that she had debated suing Epstein, but decided against it.“I just thought it was the easy way out,” she said. “And then I decided this is my life and I have to take responsibility for my own actions because I did volunteer.” – New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons august 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Order The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson hits back at critics as Sir John Major joins legal action to stop him proroguing ParliamentAustralia downgrades outlook for Great Barrier Reef to \u0026#39very poor\u0026#39Only Whitehall stands in the way of our Gatt 24 \u0026#39get out of jail free\u0026#39 Brexit card\u0026#39Whither now the Conservative Party in Scotland?\u0026#39 -  readers on this week\u0026#39s top storiesScottish judge refuses to halt plans to suspend ParliamentGirls schools could admit trans boys under proposals being considered by equalities watchdogMomentum calls for \u0026#39hundreds of thousands of people\u0026#39 to take to the streets across the countrySilver Spitfire pilot log week three: a liberating flypast – before problems hit at 8,000ftWho was the real Jeffrey Epstein, and how did he make his millions? Top baby names in England and Wales for 2018 revealed: Is your name going out of style?Inside Colombia’s ELN: How the world’s longest insurgency ditched its fight for socialism Audio Briefings: Sign up to our WhatsApp group for essential twice-daily updatesAutumn Equinox 2019: The science behind the changing seasonsMomentum militant: The former Corbyn aide who wants anti-Brexit protesters to occupy the streetsBlack super new moon 2019: What is it and will we be able to see the lunar event in the UK?HRT raises breast cancer risk by third, major Oxford study findsThree ways MPs could try to stop a no-deal BrexitHow could a no-deal Brexit affect the UK?How would a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson\u0026#39s government work, and will he win?Blue badge parking permits extended to people with hidden disabilities Ken Clarke: I would support Jeremy Corbyn as PM to block \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 BrexitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/08/26/TELEMMGLPICT000207437769_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqxTgV-VEbjByvRp9E0Pb-y4euE8mO3loKfLBNcbArYqo.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"dancers take stage launch 17th series strictly come dancing","story":"Neil and Katya Jones danced together for the first time since announcing their split during the red carpet launch of Strictly Come Dancing 2019.The pair announced their separation in an official statement earlier this month after six years of marriage and 11 years together overall.At the BBC event in London, the estranged couple performed in front of a live audience, as their fellow professionals also took to the stage.Dressed in sequinned costumes, Neil and Katya were cheered on as they performed a series of impressive moves.Their split came nearly a year after Katya was pictured kissing her former dance partner Seann Walsh, although they did not cite the comedian in their reasons for the break-up.Neil Jones and Katya Jones attend the Strictly launch in London Speaking at the launch she said: It\u0027s really, really nice.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearSimon Peters, an analyst at online trading platform eToro, explained that the recent dip may simply be as a result of a batch of bitcoin futures contracts that were set to expire.“Chicago Mercantile Exchange Bitcoin futures contracts are set to expire tomorrow, which historically has prompted trading activity within the cash market, he told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNo-deal Brexit \u0027will see Bitcoin value hit record high\u0027It’s possible that investors are selling off now to insulate themselves from greater losses in the coming days.\u0026nbspFurthermore, this downward momentum has been exacerbated by low trading volumes over the last week, which has meant that a relatively small number of big trades have been able to move the needle sharply.”Several prominent figures within the cryptocurrency community have stood by their previous positive predictions, with cyber security pioneer John McAfee\u0026nbspcontinuing to stand by his bold bet that bitcoin will hit $500,000 in 2020.Such a claim seems modest when compared to other historic predictions. Computer scientist Hal Finney, who some believe may be the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto, was perhaps the most bullish about bitcoin’s price potential.One week after the first ever genesis block of bitcoin was created in January 2009, Finney published his thoughts on what the value of bitcoin would be if it went on to replace the US dollar as the main global currency.“Imagine that bitcoin is successful and becomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world,” he wrote.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Friends, family, you know the drill. \u0026nbspIt will lend up to £10,000 at an APR interest rate of just under 50 per cent.\u0026nbspBusiness was booming until quite recently, with a successful flotation at 275p, which made a billionaire of founder James Benamor and attracted some big name investors.\u0026nbspSince then, it has been a rocky ride. Before yesterday’s update, the shares were trading at less than half their near 300p peak. They’ve since halved again.\u0026nbspBritain will pay a big price for Boris Johnson’s Brexit coupA major reason for that is this sort of lending coming under the beady eye\u0026nbspof the Financial Conduct Authority.\u0026nbspThe regulator has voiced concerns about the growth of the market, the loans’ affordability, the high incidence of repeat loans lenders like Amigo have on their books.\u0026nbspHard-up borrowers can easily get into a cycle of borrowing, and then borrowing again, which sucks money out of already strained budgets.\u0026nbspThe watchdog also worries about whether guarantors really know what they’re getting into. They are themselves often of limited means. Becoming liable for a loved one’s loan repayments is a headache many of them could do without.\u0026nbspYou can see why investors initially got excited by the company. It currently has 210,000 customers. There could be 10 million of them in its sector. Amigo and its peers have created a market among them that barely existed before its emergence, one that has been booming. Whether that’s a good thing is open to debate.\u0026nbspThe problem with the “subprime” sector is that there is within it a substantial number of people who really shouldn’t be borrowing at all, who are inclined to take out loans to make ends meet rather than to fulfil a purpose (such as buying a car to get a better job). \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A notable feature of the results is an impairment ratio of more than\u0026nbsp30 per cent of revenues, up from 25.4 per cent and a deterioration of the proportion of loan balances fully up to date or less than 31 days overdue.\u0026nbspWhat can Britain learn from a Breton town’s bustling centre?Why the Bank of Mum and Dad is now a top 10 mortgage lenderM\u0026ampS faces ejection from the top tier of British businessIf that were so, why the need for a reset, which involves improving “credit and conduct policies” and prioritising new customers over relending to existing ones?The watchdog has already capped what payday lenders can charge. It followed up with a move on stores operating in the “rent to own” sector. The charges imposed on those whose bank accounts slip into the red via “unauthorised” overdrafts have similarly been addressed.\u0026nbsp“You can expect us to be consistent and predictable in our focus on affordability,” is what it has said on the subject of guarantor loans.

Eventually, identities would likely be tied to respective inidual wallets, hence making it fully non-anonymous, unlike bitcoin.”For it to work on any significant scale, the new currency’s payment infrastructure will need to be able to process and handle a huge transaction volumes. The report suggests this would be somewhere in the region of 300,000 transactions per second, though currently no blockchains\u0026nbspare capable of supporting such a high volume.The cryptocurrency\u0026nbspwould also presumably require users to own smartphones, even if they don’t have bank accounts.

That could further suggest that Apple is aiming for a nostalgic look in the new devices.Apple confirms when it will release new iPhoneThe different hues might also be a reference to the colours of the phones themselves. With the iPhone XR last year, Apple launched the new devices in a variety of different colours – and many of those colours are present in the image.There is, at the moment, no green iPhone. But, by coincidence, that colour has also been rumoured as the new one in Apple\u0027s upcoming line-up.Apple\u0027s event invitations are always picked through for clues about what is to come. Usually, they don\u0027t offer anything concrete – but can give an important indication of the kind of theme that Apple is aiming for in the new products or the event more generally.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That software appears to have run into some problems, with the company seemingly pushing some of its main features into later in the year – and the event will presumably serve as an opportunity for the company to explain that strange release schedule.Apple launches new way to get iPhones fixedThe event will be held in Apple\u0027s Steve Jobs Theater, which was built as part of its vast new California campus, specifically for events of this kind. It was first used to introduce the iPhone X and 8 in 2017, and has played host to a number of press events since.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Once it arrives to Mars it will use its own onboard engines to navigate its way safely to the Martian surface. One of the biggest breakthroughs of the Starhopper and Starship is that they run on liquid methane and liquid oxygen, which can both be found and manufactured on Mars.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You guys have a real problem with terrorist attacks, rapes are very high, stabbings.Gretchen has no military background but reveals she decided to swap domesticity for le in the male-dominated and secretive arms industry after her brother, Alan, narrowly avoided death in the   terror attacks in .They were watching the attacks on the news when they realised that Alan could have been one of the planes that crashed into the Twin Towers, killing everyone on board.I didnt know where he was, and that was the worst thing, thats when it kicks in, says Gretchen. We didnt know how many were taken. We didnt know anything.“I’m frightened I can’t defend the people I love. I pray for the best and prepare for the worst.But it is absolute sheer defence. I want military to have quality weapons, and defend people like you.”Although she admits she is “frightened of guns”, Stacey is given a lesson in shooting a rle and Thor’s most prestigious gun, nicknamed Pandora.She says: “I feel really uneasy and awkward around guns” but Gretchen reassures her, saying: “You’re getting the same training sessions our kids go through. We are going to teach you right along with our children, with my daughter, she is .If the time comes you have to drop the camera and pick up a weapon you’ll know what to do with it.”Despite her initial reluctance, Stacey surprised herself with her “delighted” reaction when she hit the targets. She also concedes that she does feel safer when in dangerous places with people who carry guns.Stacey sees eight-year-old Richie, the son of the companys CEO fire a gun. He tells her it feels awesomeand that he wants to be a sniper when he grows up.Stacey also visits the manufacturers where she meets factory owner, Wade, who takes her through the process of producing weapons to meet Thor’s specic requirements.Wade explains the serial number of the gun means it can always be traced. If the gun is used for criminal activity, Thor will stop selling to that client.The company takes two weeks to produce  rles, which cost around £, each.To test them, each gun is fired  times as part of the companys “internal policy”, before it is wiped to remove fingerprints, packaged and sent to the client.Only three components are needed to make a bullet: the case, powder and projectile.Although making weapons is a vital part of their work the most important part is the paperwork, whichnot completed correctly could see Gretchen face serious consequences.She said: “We follow the rules. We can lose our licence or go to jail. It’s a federal offence. It could be  years per weaponpaperwork isn’t right.”During filming for the documentary, the terrorist attacks at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, which killed  people take place.Thor were in the midst of organising an order to a gun shop in New Zealand where the terrorists bought their firearms.Before the attacks, New Zealand gun laws meant anyone over  could own a gun. In the wake of the atrocities, Thor’s order was put on hold.Askedthe attack proves selling arms has dangerous repercussions, Payton says: “I don’t blame all car drivers for one drunk driver.

From next June, only those over-s on pension credit will be eligible for free TV licences — just one in five people.That means .million pensioners, including more than , service veterans, will have to find £. a yearthey want to continue watching television.To add insult to injury, the BBC then disclosed how much money it is paying its stars.Anti-Brexit activist and Match Of The Day presenter Gary Lineker is on £,,, Graham Norton is on £, and Claudia Winkleman is on £,.Lineker’s salary alone would pay for more than , TV licences.Asthat wasn’t bad enough, earlier this month the Beeb said it intends to spend £million on an advertising campaign to attract young viewers and listeners.That’s more than the annual budget of Radio .It’s particularly high, given that the BBC can advertise on its own TV channels and radio stations for free. Apparently, the money is going to be spent on targeting young people on social media.Are we really supposed to believe that the BBC cannot afford to pay for pensioners’ TV licences, but can fritter away £million on Facebook adverts There’s almost nothing Auntie won’t stoop to in its desperate pursuit of the “yoof” audience.It has earmarked £million to promote its new Sounds app — including spending £, to transform the London Eye into the “London Ear” — and poured money into a series of increasingly tawdry podcasts, such as Gemma Collins talking about her le, a reality-show round-up called Reality Tea, and Unexpected Fluids, in which teenagers tell embarrassing ­stories about when sex goes wrong.It’s all a far cry from Lord Reith’s mission to explain.No doubt the BBC is concerned about how few young people it manages to attract — and this manests itself in other ways, too, such as its massive investment in apps and podcasts and its extensive online coverage of ITV’s Love Island.Last year, Ofcom revealed that  to -year-olds are spending an average of an hour and  minutes per day consuming BBC content, which is about half the amount for all age groups.Even more worrying for the Corporation, one in eight young Brits consumes no BBC content at all. Why should they fork out £. for the licence fee, particularly as many of them will already be paying for subscription TV services The fundamental problem the Beeb faces is that consumers are becomingly increasingly accustomed to paying for the TV content they want to watch and resent having to pay a mandatory flat tax to a single provider.The equivalent would beeveryone who owns a phone, tablet or laptop had to pay £. for an “internet licence” to fund Apple’s iTunes, regardless of whether or not they use the service.It’s time to do away with the licence fee — for everyone, not just the over-s.That would mean stripping down the state-funded parts of the BBC to its core news and current affairs output and funding that out of general taxation.It should sell off its profitable private isions — such as BBC Studios, which has annual revenues of more than £billion — and plough the money into creating its own subscription service.With its global brand recognition and unrivalled back catalogue, not to mention its reputation for high-quality drama, the BBC could easily compete with commercial providers such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.Promising to scrap the licence fee would surely be a vote-winner for Boris Johnson.No s, no buts. When it comes to renewing the BBC’s Royal Charter, it’s time to say: “No deal.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But binning the toxic Irish backstop might not be enough eventhe EU agrees.There is plenty in Theresa May’s deal to bind our hands even after we have left.The Sun would still prefer a deal. But Farage will capitalise, understandably so,Boris signs away any sovereign powers in haste to get Brexit over the line. That could yet cost him power.This may all be moot. We do not see Brussels nor the Irish PM scrapping the backstop they have treated as holy writ.But when his own allies like Iain Duncan Smith warn him not to be satisfied solely with that, Boris must listen.WHO’S up for more years of bitter Brexit ision and political paralysis Not Leavers, who were sick of it long ago and are furious their vote hasn’t been fulfilled. Not the EU, either. Its leaders, Boris says, just want it done now too.But others ARE bent on prolonging the agony indefinitely.

As Boris was arguing, the real barriers to trade are not practical ones — they are taxes and regulations.Remainers continually lecture us on the benefits of free trade with the EU — and they are right to do so. Hardly anyone really wants to leave without a deal. If we do have to take that route it will surely not be long before discussions on a free trade deal recommence.Yet those same Remainers bizarrely retreat in horror when anyone suggests we do a free trade deal with the US. “But we’ll have to eat chlorinated chicken,” they complain, as well as GM “Frankenstein” food.As shown by their failure yesterday to agree on a common course of action to thwart Brexit, Remainers are bumbling along in a state of confusion.But nothing demonstrates this better than their contradictory approach to free trade. They seem to think it a great benefit to the country when conducted with the EU, but a route to national disastercarried out with any other country.The charge that anyone will be forced to eat chlorinated chicken or GM foods is, needless to say, a far bigger porky pie than anything Boris has said on the subject.It is far from certain that a Johnson Government, when engaged in trade talks with the US, will make the concessions allowing these products into UK markets, butit does, then UK shoppers will continue to have a choice.They will still be able to buy chicken produced in Britain or the EU, or they will be able to choose to eat American chicken.I certainly have no fear of eating chicken which has been washed in chlorine. The idea that it is “dangerous” has been thoroughly debunked. Each of us ingests far more chlorine through drinking water than we ever would do through eating US-produced chicken.As for GM foods, we already eat them, vegans especially. The EU allows imports of GM soyafor simple practical reasons. Most of it is grown in the Americas and too many growers there use GM seed for non-GM soya to be sold as a separate product.If we want free trade we are not going to achieve it just by persuading other countries to open their markets to us. No, we will have to make the concession of opening our markets to them too. But there is no reason to be frightened.True, there are some products which need to be banned from sale for genuine health and safety reasons. But most of the EU’s food product standards are really just a form of protectionism in disguise, dreamed up to block competition for European farmers.If we do post-Brexit trade deals with the US and other countries — and in the process do away with the EU’s protectionist tarfs and product standards — some UK producers would suffer.But others would prosper as they enjoyed access to new export markets. Overall, as is almost always the case when trade barriers are taken down, we would benefit. Strong industries would grow and consumers would enjoy greater choice and lower prices.Boris’s vision of a global British pork pie industry shows the dference between him and the political opponents who spent much of yesterday scheming over how to stop him taking Britain out of the EU.While his glass is half full, theirs is half empty.They are driven by a pathological fear of le outside the EU.It is not that they have any great enthusiasm for the EU. After all, I haven’t heard one of them make a convincing case why the EU is an institution to be admired. It is just that they have a lack of ambition for Britain and so cling to EU membership.After meeting for several hours yesterday, what did the likes of Jeremy Corbyn, Keir Starmer and Jo Swinson come up with That they want to extend Article  yet further, to prolong yet again the endless drt which unsettled markets and put off investment.Thanks to the Remain lobby’s endless infighting and self-indulgent argument over who it would like as a caretaker Prime Minister, that is exactly what is overwhelmingly likely to happen on October . Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nahid in Farsi means Venus.The satellite, which had Irans first foldable solar , was supposed to be in a low orbit around the Earth for some two-and-a-half months.The semi-official Mehr news agency quoted Jahromi on Aug.  as saying that the Nahid- was ready to be delivered to Irans Defense Ministry, signalling a launch date for the satellite likely loomed.Irans National Week of Government, during which Tehran often inaugurates new projects, began August .Earlier today, Irans Defence Minister General Amir Hatami told the state-run IRNA news agency that the countrys satellite activities were being done in a transparent way, responding to AP and other foreign media reporting on activity at the space centre.Iran has also pledged to breach the agreement until it receives the sanctions relief it says it is owed.The deal was an agreement between the Islamic Republic and a group of world powers aimed at scrapping the Middle Eastern countrys nuclear weapons programme.It saw Iran agree to eliminate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium by  per cent.Enriched uranium is a critical component for making nuclear weapons and in nuclear power stations and by curbing the amount Iran produce is a way to curb the number of weapons produced.As part of the agreement, Iran also agreed to only enrich their uranium up to . per cent over the next  years and they agreed to reduce their gas centruges for  years.Gas centruges are used to separate dferent types of uranium which allows specic types to then be used to manufacture nuclear weapons or generators.Iranian nuclear facilities were limited to a single facility with only first-generation centruges for  years and other nuclear facilities had to be converted into other use.In addition, they were barred from building any more heavy-water faculties - a type of nuclear reactor which uses heavy wateras a coolant to maintain temperatures in the reactor.Also under the agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency was granted regular access to all Iranian nuclear facilities to ensure Iran maintains the deal.If Iran abided by the deal it was promised relief from the US, European Union, and the United Nations Security Council on all nuclear-related economic sanctions.The agreement was reached on July , , and the world powers signed it in Vienna.Whenever activity and research bear successful results, we will announce the good news, Hatami said.Iran at times in the past hasnt acknowledged failed launches.The apparent attempt to launch the Nahid- comes after two failed satellite launches of the Payam and Doosti in January and February.A separate fire at the Imam Khomeini Space Centre in February also killed three researchers, authorities said at the time.I think it is certainly an image problem, said Michael Connell, an Iran analyst at the Arlington, Virginia-based nonprofit research organisation CNA.I think its going to embarrass the Iranian space agency. On the other hand though, getting a satellite into space ... takes time.Tehran also says it doesnt violate the UN as it only called upon Tehran not to conduct such tests.The tests have taken on new importance to the US amid the maximalist approach to Iran taken by President Donald Trumps administration.Tensions have been high between the countries since Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from Irans nuclear deal over a year ago and imposed sanctions, including on Irans oil industry.Iran recently has begun to break the accord itself while trying to push Europe to help it sell oil abroad."},{"url":null,"title":"employees","story":"But sadly, not all of us are lucky enough to have understanding and considerate managers - some are just plain mean.From being forced to miss a funeral to being blamed for theft, people have shared their horrendous experiences with their employers."},{"url":null,"title":"airline boss sacked fatshaming british airways cabin crew branding unkempt","story":"Katarzyna Richter secretly snapped the workers on a flight and savaged their “double chin, rotten and uneven teeth”.The cabin crew operations director at LOT Polish Airlines shared her astonishing criticism on Facebook.She wrote: “Today, my attention was drawn to grooming and appearance of British Airways cabin crew members, unpolished shoes, holes in tights, too tight unorm, double chin, rotten and uneven teeth, messy hairstyle.”In her attack, during a flight from Gatwick to Poland, Ms Richter also suggested BA workers were slack with their duties.She added: “By the way I am curiousyou as a passenger judge cabin crew by the way they look ”Outraged airline staff hit back, lambasting Ms Richter for photographing crew and sharing images online without their permission.One BA worker told The Sun: “How dare this airline executive invite the public to assess the appearance of a rival carriers workers.

It’s with us the people – and that’s why we need to take action.Our message to Johnson is this:you steal our democracy, well shut down the streets.But Tories reacted with fury to Momentums ludicrous plan.David TC Davies told The Sun: Momentum seem to think that no one should do anything without their permission - and theyre going to block the streetsthey dont get their way.And its ironic that they are complaining about Parliament being shut down while they are stopping anyone from getting there at all.Another MP added: “They appear to be trying to ‘Stop the Coup’ as they put it by launching one of their own.”A former Labour MP – Tom Blenkinsop – tweeted that Momentum was “playing into the hands of the right” with their fury.It comes after thousands of people turned up to protest outside Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament last night.Spontaneous protests are being planned in Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield too.Earlier today Mr Rees-Mogg urged teeth-gnashing Remainers to change the law or boot the Government out -they can.The Commons leader led the Government fightback today against pro-EU MPs who have vowed to stop Boris Johnson shutting down Parliament next month.Mr Rees-Mogg told them to bring it on - and that the Government was ready.He told the BBC this morning: All these people who are wailing and gnashing of teeth know that there are two ways of doing what they want to do.One, is to change the government and the other is to change the law. If they do either of those, that will then have an effect.If they dont have either the courage or the gumption to do either of those then we will leave on the st of October in accordance with the referendum result.And he added: No party should be afraid of the British people.If they have a vote of confidence, lets seethey can win it.He said the outrage over shutting down Parliament was phoney and blasted Speaker Bercow for his insistent.The teasing came as he said that Mr Corbyn doesnt have enough mates to win such a vote.Nobody wants him to be PM, he joked, labelling those who are trying to thwart Brexit as spewing out phoney outrage because they want to stop us from leaving.They are trying very hard to overturn the referendum result, he blasted.Labours Barry Gardiner confirmed to Sky News today that Labour would apply for an emergency debate next week, and would seek to force Boris to get another Brexit extension.Yesterday Boris asked the Queen for her approval to suspend proceedings for nearly five weeks from as early as September  -

a US bank holiday when the Sunshine State will be packed with tourists.The eye of Dorian is expected to hit the east and north of Turks and Caicos and the southeastern Bahamas later today - where warnings are already in place.Floridas governor has now extended a state of emergency to cover all of the state, including multiple tourist destinations.Ron DeSantis took the step as authorities cancelled some commercial flights, planned precautions at rocket launch sites along the Space Coast.He also put , National Guard troops on alert.No evacuations have been ordered as yet but many are expected ahead of Monday.That would make it a Category  storm, the second-strongest on the Saffir-Simpson scale which measures hurricane intensity.Dorian is likely to make landfall on Floridas eastern coast before lingering over central Florida on Tuesday.However, tropical storm-force winds could begin in parts of Florida as early as Saturday evening, weather experts warn.All residents, especially those along the east coast, need to be prepared for possible impacts, said governor DeSantis.As it increases strength, this storm has the potential to severely damage homes, businesses and buildings, which is why all Floridians should remain vigilant.Do not wait until it is too late to make a plan.NASA footage - taken from the International Space Station on Thursday - shows the vortex gaining in power just north of Puerto Rico.Dorian was packing maximum sustained winds of mph on Thursday morning some  miles north-northwest of San Juan, and about  miles east of the Bahamas.In an address to the nation last night, President Trump warned: It really began to form, and form big.Now, its looking like it could be an absolute monster.Earlier, Trump cancelled the planned visit to Poland this weekend so he could remain in the US to monitor the storms impact.He is sending Vice President Mike Pence in his place as he wants to make sure federal resources are properly directed at the arriving storm.In the tweeted video from the White House rose garden, Trump added that food and water supplies were hurriedly being shipped to Florida.And he said of the impending storm: It does seem almost certain that its hitting dead centre and thats not good.The winds seem to be building at a tremendous rate.It looks like the winds are going to be unbelievably high.Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands managed to avoid the brunt of the hurricane this week - with only light damage and flooding reported.But the increasingly menacing-looking storm system will draw energy from the warm open waters as it closes in, forecasters say.University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy warned: If it makes landfall as a Category  or  hurricane, thats a big deal.No immediate mass evacuations have yet been ordered as the exact path of the storm remained unclear.Local governments along Floridas east coast yesterday began distributing sandbags while shoppers rushed to stock up on supplies.Supermarket shelves were cleared and motorists topped up their tanks and filled petrol cans - sparking shortages in some areas.Dorian is expected to pick up steam as it pushes out into warm waters with favourable winds.Forecasters said the coastal areas of southeast Florida could be deluged with up to  inches of rain in some places triggering le-threatening floods.Royal Caribbean, Carnival and Norwegian have now began rerouting their cruise ships ahead of the looking weather front..Major airlines began allowing travellers to change their reservations without a fee.A Rolling Stones concert Saturday at the Hard Rock Stadium near Miami was moved up to Friday night.The hurricane season typically peaks between mid-August and late October.The unnamed Category  hurricane crashed ashore along Floridas Gulf Coast on September  -

But he is on a collision course, not only with the government but the Queen and the clerks of the House.”Jeremy Corbyn confirmed yesterday that he would strike on Tuesday and legislate rapidly to try and stop Parliaments shut down and a No Deal Brexit.And he urged Momentum members and other Labour supporters to take to the streets and join protests against it.This morning a court is due to rule on whether its unlawful or not for Boris to shut down Parliament ahead of the Brexit deadline.Scotland’s highest civil court was due to rule at am today whether the move to prorogue Parliament was lawful.It could force Boris Johnson to reverse the controversial decision.Another two legal challenges - in London and Belfast - are also trying to stop the move.And last night former Tory Chancellor Ken Clarke admitted he would back Jeremy Corbyn to be PMhe absolutely had to - but only as long as he couldnt implement any of his leftie policies."},{"url":null,"title":"brits told to get ready for brexit","story":"The mass drive, spread across billboards and the government’s website, will inform Brits about No Deal as Boris Johnson prepares to leave the EU on October .ltgtMichael Gove has been tasked with launching the campaign after its plans were poured over by the PM’s Brexit guru, Dominic Cummings.Cummings, the brains behind Vote Leave, made sure the technical documents were easy to understand for members of the public, the Times reports.One source said: “Dom Cummings is bringing a sub-machine gun to a kne fight.

And Downing Street insiders now believe crashing out of the EU without a deal to be the most likely outcome on Halloween. MPs may try to block a no-deal Brexit by voting to bring down the government. But the Prime Minister attempted to thwart them by proroguing Parliament for more than a month. No Deal been talked about for years. Theresa May secured a deal which MPs then voted down three times the EU delayed the date of Brexit twice and now Boris Johnson will only accept a deal which strips out the Northern Ireland Backstop. But the whole time no-deal has been the backup plan - with Theresa May committing £billion or so, and Boris Johnson adding another £. billion to the cost.    That includes a huge advertising campaign - costing more than £, to encourage the public to prepare for a chaotic exit. So what does it actually mean in practical terms  If thereaposs no arrangement in time, weaposll lose  international trade deals in a blink, shed access to EU criminal databases and face the prospect of goods checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The government published  technical notices over  and  outlining the practical effects of no-deal - from driving licences to cats.    UK officials also unveiled aposday oneapos tarfs that would slap £, on the cost of a family car from the EU - but leave % of goods imports, including steel, tarf free. This could threaten struggling UK industries with a flood of cheap imports, but would also prevent searing price hikes that hit your wallet in the short term. Meanwhile ministers had , troops held at readiness, could call up Army reserves and declare martial law. Supermarkets and pharma giants were told to stockpile food and medicine. A lot of the effects are on business. UK farmers face a nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. Fishermen could be blocked from EU waters. And manufacturers fear their supply chains drying up. But businesses are not what whoaposve written this guide for. Instead we have tried to establish  ways no-deal Brexit will affect you, the reader and your everyday le.  What is a no-deal Brexit  No Deal is the default optionMPs, the EU and the UK government canapost agree a Brexit aposWithdrawal Agreementapos by the Brexit deadline . The current -page deal, on the table since November , would have ensured businesses arenapost cut off by continuing rules in a apostransition periodapos until December . However, it came at a cost - a aposbackstopapos that could trap the UK in an EU customs union from . That means MPs and Boris Johnson opposed it. Mr Johnson has vowed to re-open talks on the deal, including dumping the backstop, despite the EU refusing to do so. If that fails, it leads us to a no-deal Brexit. Leaving with no deal will mean falling back on World Trade Organisation trade tarfs - increasing the price of imports and exports - and could leave legal aposblack holesapos where EU law stood before. The UK government has been ramping up preparations for no deal since the beginning of summer . After Boris Johnson took power, spending on no-deal preparations topped £billion. What is Boris Johnsonaposs plan for no-deal Brexit   Plan Ais to renegotiate Theresa Mayaposs original, -page Brexit deal and come out with a deal on October . Plan B is to leave with no deal, but get a standstill arrangement from November  onwards to prevent crippling new tarfs. Plan Cis to leave with no deal and no standstill arrangement. Experts say Plan B in particular is complete fantasy land. Boris Johnson claims he can use Article  of the General Agreement on Tarfs and Tradeto stop new tarfs springing up. This is called a managed no-deal - arranging lots of mini-deals to help smooth the path of leaving the EU. But GATT  says a plan and schedule must already be in place to form a customs union or free trade area, within a reasonableof time. That doesnapost include a no-deal Brexit . What does the governmentaposs financial watchdog say about no-deal Brexit  no-deal Brexit would trigger a year-long UK recession in just a few monthsapos time, the governmentaposs official spending watchdog predicted in July . The Office for Budget Responsibility said a recession would begin in the final three months of the UK leaves without agreement on October . The pound would drop in value instantly by % - while unemployment would rise by more than a quarter. GDP would fall % by the end of , around the same as the early s recession and a third of what was seen in the  financial crisis. In all no-deal would add about £billion a year to government borrowing from , the OBR said - or, put another way, £million a week. That in turn would hike the UKaposs net debt by % of GDP by March . Despite the drastic findings, OBR forecasters said their stress test was by no means a worst-case scenario.     ways no-deal Brexit could hit you NOTE: This information was gleaned mainly from government no-deal preparedness documents and advice over the last year. Some of these situations may be avoidedthere is a managed no-deal. . Martial law could be imposed with thousands of troops on standby  More than , troops are being held at readiness in case there is a disastrous no-deal Brexit. Army reserves are also legally able to be called upthere is civil unrest, while councils are braced for possible runs on banks, fuel and food. Local Resilience Forums are reporting back to Whitehall and expect several months of disruptionthere is no deal. The government has plans in case it needs to impose martial law - military law - and curfews to restore order. Cabinet minister Matt Hancock admitted the plans existed but insisted the government was not specically looking at martial law and it was not the focus of our attention. . You need to renew your passport early  At the moment, British citizens can enter aposSchengen areaapos countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left before they expire. But in a no deal Brexit, after  October  you may not be able to travel to these countriesyou have less than six months left on your passport. The government is advising travellers to renew any passports older than nine years and six months. . Usually this means renewing six months before your passport expires. Butyour passport had more than  yearsapos validity, youaposll have to renew earlier, because the extra months on top of  years donapost count. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. . Pet owners must visit the vet FOUR MONTHS before a holiday  There is a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. The main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners must visit a vet at least four months before taking their pet the EU. And because talks are ongoing, that means youaposd better book in now. The animal must have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least  days later, to prove the vaccination worked. Pet owners must then wait at least three months before visiting the vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts.  . KFC and other big names could run out of food - and water supplies could be affected  Food is being stockpiled forwe crash out of the EU without a deal, and ministers have promised an adequate supply.  But thataposs not the same as having the range of food we do now. Leaked plans in December warned Brits could have to y their diet.  And in January, big names KFC, Pret, Lidl, Co-Op, MS, Waitrose, Sainsburyaposs, Asda and McDonaldaposs signed a damning letter warning food supplies could run short because of disruptions to the supply chain. They wrote in a joint letter to MPs: Our ability to mitigate these risks is limited.   As prudent businesses we are stockpiling where possible, but all frozen and chilled storage is already being used and there is very little general warehousing space available in the UK.  They added: Retailers typically store no more than two weeksapos inventory and it becomes dficult to restock storesthe supply chain is disrupted. Leaked preparations under the governmentaposs Operation Yellowhammer warned some fresh food stocks will be affected and hundreds of thousands of people will be hit by problems with water supply. While there will not be overall food shortages, a combination of factors “will reduce availability and choice and increase the price”. Poorest families would be worst hit and “there is a risk that panic buying will disrupt food supplies”. There is also a warning of a “failure in the chemicals supply chain” for water. “The likelihood of this is considered low, affecting hundreds of thousands of people. Urgent action may need to be taken to make sure people have access to clean water.” . You could lose your job  A string of firms have either moved jobs out of the UK or are threatening to do so in a no-deal situation. Airbus, which employs , people in the UK with around , more jobs in supply chains, warned it may move where. Car plants are moving forward standard shutdowns to be around Brexit in case there are supply chain issues. And critics fear new investment will not come the UKaposs way, hitting jobs in generations More jobs could be lost due to oil refineries shutting down according to the Operation Yellowhammer document . Petrol supplies could be hit, oil refineries could shut and , workers lose their jobs. Panic-buying could create shortages, such as those seen during the  fuel crisis. The briefing says: “Traffic disruption caused by border delays could affect fuel distribution in the local area, particularlytraffic queues in Kent block the Dartford Crossing, which would disrupt fuel supply in London and the South East. “Customer behaviour could lead to shortages in other parts of the country.” Strikes over job losses at refineries could unleash disruption for two weeks. . Your motorway commute faces becoming a lorry park  UPDATE: After the October extension was agreed, Highways England deactivated Operation Brock until further notice. You can find the latest updates here. Major motorways in the South of England are set for serious disruption in case of a no-deal Brexit. From aposearly apos the Mwill be closed as needed from junctions -, with a contraflow of both directions on the opposite side, so it can be used as a lorry parkthere is gridlock at Dover. A backup lorry park will be in place at Manston Airport. The M in Kent is also expected to be used as a holding area for lorries. And a similar fate could befall a -mile stretch of the M towards Southampton. The Treasuryaposs additional £. billion no-deal Brexit fund, announced in early August , includes more cash to improve transport infrastructure around the Kent coast. The leaked Operation Yellowhammer document also warned Lorries using Channel ports may not be ready for French customs checks. It says: “The lack of traders’ readiness combined with limited space in French ports to hold HGVs could reduce [traffic] flow rates to %-% of current levels within a day. “The worst disruption might continue for three months before flow rates rise to %-%, although disruption could continue for much longer. “The French might act to ensure some flow through the crossings. HGVs could face a maximum delay of one and a half to two and a half days to cross the border.” . Millions of plane tickets could be cancelled  UPDATE: In March  the EU and UK agreed in principle to an reciprocal arrangement which would keep planes in the air for a year after the original exit date of  March  even in a no deal scenario. Itaposs unclear whether this will now apply for a year after  October. The International Air Transport Associationwarn up to million plane tickets could be cancelledthere is no deal. Currently it is not known exactly which tickets could be hit, or how passengers would find outthey are at risk. The situation arose because in a aposno dealapos, there will be no automatic legal basis for flights between the EU and UK after pm on  March . Under a pact struck between the UK and EU in December, basic connectivity will be maintained for a -month periodthereaposs no-deal. But according to the IATA - which represents  airlines including British Airways - that only means maintaining the number of flights in . It does not allow an increase in services - yet tickets have already been sold based on a predicted increase. Talks are ongoing, but Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, previously warned flights could be groundedgoodwill fails. . Youaposll find it harder to drive in the EU  Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, you should get an International Driving Permit. The £. documents were due to be sold at , post offices from February. Before they were sold at fewer than . The number of permits issued would have to soar from , a year to million. Meanwhile you will also be forced to apply for a aposgreen cardapos to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting. . Up to a million Brits may be forced to take a new driving test  British people driving in Europe could be forced to take a new driving testthereaposs a no deal Brexit. Up to a million Brits living in Europe were told to replace their driving licence with a local permit immediately. Guidance issued by the Department for Transport said: If you are a UK licence holder living in the EU or EEA you should exchange your UK driving licence for a local EU driving licence before  March . From that date, in the event that there is no EU Exit deal, you may have to pass a driving test in the EU country you live in to be able to carry on driving there. . If youaposre an EU citizen, youaposll have fewer rights to stay in the UK  More than million EU citizens living in the UK will have less concrete rights to stay. Whether thereaposs a Brexit deal or not, EU citizens can stay in Britainthey register for settled status with the government. But the rules are stricter in a no-deal Brexit. In no-deal, only EU citizens arriving before October  can apply, not those arriving by December . The deadline to apply will be  December , instead of  June there is a Brexit deal. And family members will only be able to join settled EU citizens in the UK before  March . As for the other way round - major EU nations have inidually said theyaposll allow UK ex-pats to stay, but this could y by country. And the rules could become stricter, with Home Secretary Priti Patel working on a crackdown to take effect on Day One of a no-deal Brexit. . Pharmacies and hospitals could start rationing medicine  Pharmacists have requested special powers to ration medicinesthere is no Brexit deal Under plans by the Healthcare Distribution Association, they would have special powers to y doctorsapos prescriptions and offer something a drug is unavailable.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry. Government and NHS chiefs have set up a war room called the aposOperational Response Centreapos and industry firms are creating six-week stockpiles of medicine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock chartered a plane to fly in short-shelf-le products, like isotopes for cancer treatment, from Maastricht. Insulin could also be stockpiled. Mr Hancock claimed heaposd become the biggest buyer of fridges in the world, after fitting out facilities for storage of the crucial drugs. NHS staff are being directed to urge patients not to stockpile medicines personally to avoid shortages throughout the system. The Operation Yellowhammer document warned: While some products can be stockpiled, others cannot because of short shelf lives. It will not be practical to stockpile six months’ supplies.” Three-quarters of drugs arrive via Folkestone and Dover, making them “particularly vulnerable to severe delays”. Medicines for diabetes, some leukaemia treatments and flu vaccinations must be transported under temperature controls. “Supply chains are also highly regulated and require transportation that meets strict Good Distribution Practices. This can include limits on transit times.” The leaked document also warned social care could be hit by rising inflation - leaving operators facing collapse within months. “The adult social care market is already fragile because of the declining financial viability of providers. “An increase in inflation after the UK’s EU exit would affect providers of adult social care through increasing staff and supply costs and might lead to failure within two-three months for smaller providers and four-six months for larger ones. “Intelligence will be gathered to prepare for effects on the sector, including closure of services and handing back of contracts that are not part of the normal market .” . Your mobile phone roaming charges may be hiked  Mobile roaming charges face an immediate hikethere is a no-deal Brexit, the government has confirmed. Tory ministers are revoking the EU law which guarantees UK citizens pay the same for using their phone on the Continent as they do at home. That will leave mobile phone firms free to hike costs whenever they like after the UK leaves. Guaranteed free roaming launched across the EU just  months ago - and meant big savings. But that guarantee will be scrappedthere is no deal, thanks to an obscure law laid before Parliament. . You should get insurance and flexible tickets for Eurostar aposdisruptionapos  Eurostar services could be suspended in a worst-case no deal Brexit. The government has told international train passengers - including the Eurostar - to make sure they have insurance and ticket terms and conditions that are sufficient to cover possible disruption. That implies passengers should buy FLEXIBLE tickets - not the fixed cheap ones that are popular for their low cost. The UK will need bilateral deals with France, Belgium and the Netherlands to ensure international trains keep running. Without such a deal, Britain has proposed recognising EU operator licences until March  to ensure services can continue. But this isnapost guaranteed, and UK operators would have to reapply with the EU. The EU has agreed to keep permissions for services like the Channel Tunnel open for three monthsthere is no-deal, while a new agreement is negotiated. But there arenapost guarantees. Former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis claimed the vital train link between Britain and Europe could be severed. . You might have to go through airport security twice  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit.  Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport, before changing flights for an onward destination, would be screened in Britain as they are now.  But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight.  “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says a Department for Transport briefing note.  “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.”  . You could be barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statesthereaposs a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But a government technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. . If you live in Northern Ireland, you face electricity blackouts  Northern Ireland will be forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. A worst-case no-deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea. But Northern Irelandaposs Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventhereaposs a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. There has been talk of barges in the Irish Sea. Dustin Benton of Green Alliance warned:Any emergency action to keep the lights on, both in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the UK, would likely be highly polluting and expensive. . You could be stranded on your package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thataposs based anywhere in the EU. But in a no-deal Brexit, that protection would only applythe firms are targeting the UK market. That means those booking with, say, a cheaper Spanish firm online that has no UK presence could be unprotected. Eventhe UK government could act, in practice it will be much harder to take enforcement action against foreign firms because other countries will no longer recognise UK courts. And the leaked Operation Yellowhammer document warns passengers travelling to and from the EU may face more immigration checks. “UK citizens travelling to and from the EU may be subject to increased immigration checks at border posts. This may lead to passenger delays at St Pancras, Channel Tunnel and Dover, where border controls are juxtaposed. “Depending on what plans EU member states put in place to cope with these increased checks, it is likely delays will occur for UK arrivals and departures at EU airports and ports. This could cause some disruption on transport services. Travellers may decide to use alternative routes.” . Youaposll lose rights to take action over dangerous products  Government documents reveal the same problem - UK courts not being recognised - will strip Brits of their consumer rights for EU goods bought online. Alex Neill of consumer group Which  warned: A no-deal Brexit would massively weaken peopleaposs rights to take action when they purchase faulty or dangerous products from outside the UK. The Governmentaposs advice that we all become experts in international consumer law is hopelessly unrealistic. Securing a good deal with the EU is vital to ensure that Brexit doesnapost result in a bonfire of consumer rights and protections.” . Your cigarette packets will change  Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in a no-deal Brexit. And in some ways they are even more gruesome than the ones we have now. The grim pictures show a foot ridden with peripheral vascular disease, a clogged artery, a bleeding brain and high-resolution teeth stained black. The photos will be changed in a no-deal Brexit because the European Commission owns theon ones we currently use. That means the UK would be unable to use them after  October . . If youaposre going through a family breakdown, you could be trapped in limbo  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on  October . Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advicethey will not finish by Brexit Day. A government technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” . Your everyday medicines and perfumes could become more expensive  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. Sowe leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between £ and £,. They will also need an import export license, which costs £. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. Butthere’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks wonapost be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. And finally... your regular caviar parties are doomed!  Caviar imports will be snarled up or stop completely in a no-deal Brexit. Sturgeon eggs join snowdrops, orchids and reptiles in aposendangered speciesapos that would need import and export permits to cross an EU border. Youaposd only be allowed to bring in g of caviar for personal use.

Katarzyna Richter posted the photos online commenting on the employeesapos “double chin, rotten and uneven teeth”. She added that their unorm was too tight, they had messy hair and were not fulfilling their duties properly. Ms Richter, a cabin crew operations director at LOT Polish Airlines, was fired after her remarks provoked anger. She had been on a flight from Gatwick to Poland when she took the photos. She wrote on Facebook : “Today, my attention was drawn to grooming and appearance of British Airways cabin crew members,unpolished shoes, holes in tights, too tight unorm, double chin, rotten and uneven teeth, messy hairstyle.”  She added: “By the way I am curiousyou as a passenger judge cabin crew by the way they look ” But BA employees have since hit back at Ms Richter for photographing the workers without their permission. One worker told The Sun: “How dare this airline executive invite the public to assess the appearance of a rival carrieraposs workers. The primary job of BA staff is to keep passengers safe. “This woman should know more than anyone how to behave.    “She must be sacked for fat-shaming BA crew while going about their duties. She’s a disgrace to her employer and the aviation industry.” Ms Richter, who has also worked for Etihad, Emirates and Gulf Air, was criticised by other airline employees too. One fumed: “She’s gone way, way too far. There is no excuse.” A LOT airline spokesman said: “We are truly sorry for this situation. The comments published by one of our employees on the private Facebook profile are contrary to the applicable standards and the value system adopted at LOT Polish Airlines.  Such behavior is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by our company, therefore we decided to terminate the co-operation with Mrs. Richter with immediate effect. Furthermore, we ensure that this situation will never happen again by drawing even more attention to the notication of Social Media Policy and applicable procedures to our Employees.

Community workers fear that people reliant on foodbanks - like Dominic Barber, from Everton in Liverpool - could suffer in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal. An Everton foodbank organiser said people in Liverpool are living in aposabsolute squalorapos and warned that a no-deal Brexit could have an unimaginable impact on the service, the Liverpool Echo reports. Dominic told ITV News: Sometimes you can be left with £ to last a month. Are you living on the breadline  Email webnews@trinitymirror    My worst nightmare [is] someone knocking on my door, saying apossorry Mr Barber, you canapost feed your children, you canapost clothe your children, Iaposm going to have to take your kids away.apos Because the minute that happens, I wonapost be on this earth. The father-of-four spoke to ITV during a special segment about poverty in Liverpool and how one in every three children live below the poverty line. A DWP spokesperson said children growing up in working households are five times less likely to be in relative poverty, But the Echo spoke to Gerard Woodhouse, general manager of L Community Centre who was also featured in the special report. Gerard said: Iaposm more than worried at the moment. Everything we do will be affected by a no-deal Brexit. Our food only lasts two weeks, weaposre constantly relying on donations and the council are under-funded as it is. To be honest, weaposre living on S*** Street.    He spoke about how the people he helps are the poorest of the poor and that they feel completely abandoned by London politicians. He said: Iaposm absolutely fed up of hearing the rubbish thataposs coming out of Westminster. I invite anyone from London to come to Liverpool and see how people are living. They are living in absolute squalor. Their homes have no furniture, no gas, no electricity and no hot water so you can imagine what the houses look like. People are having to cook a tin of donated beans from the food bank on a portable camping stove. But general manager at L, Gerard says Dominic isnapost even one of the worse cases.    He told the ECHO: His problems arenapost that severe in comparison with some of the people we help. We got a call for help the other day regarding a -year-old man who had fallen after a heart attack.

Research by the Association of Play Industries, seen exclusively by the Mirror, shows % of parents of children with health issues feel the lack of outdoor play facilities has contributed to their children’s problems. Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Andrew Gwynne warned: “Unfortunately children are... paying the price for Tory cuts to local government funding.

They warned a decline would lead to “severe consequences” for public health. Despite this, on average, £million less each year is being spent on play provisions. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum said yesterday: “Closing parks is woeful short-term thinking. “When parks and playgrounds are cut, children are denied the freedom and space to run around, and the calories just stay on them. The more they are denied this freedom, the more likely they are to become obese.” Grandma-of-five Theresa Thomas, , of Weoley Castle, Birmingham said her council removed all the play equipment from her closest park.

The video footage captures the hard-to-watch scene of the cowsapos corpses strewn across the mountains. According to local media, the area where the animals were kept is located around the top of the mountain and it is dficult to reach without a suitable vehicle. A neighbour also told local media that the scene was macabre and explained that the cattle were in the area because they are owned by a farmer from Santa Maria de Ordas, a municipality within the same province.    The farmer had reportedly rented the whole mountain so that the cattle could graze. The neighbours also claimed that these kinds of events are uncommon, as lightning does not usually strike animals. The regional government has sent a team of veterinarians to take samples from the dead cows for postmortem examination. Jose Domingo Cuesta, a local vet, said he knew about the case when a hunter sent him the footage. As soon as I saw it I said that the deaths had been caused by a lightning strike. He also said that the lightning spread through the land and went into their nails. For those large animals the effect is terrible. It goes into them, their blood is frozen.

There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate.

McMullan has been a key provider for United’s goals once more this season while former Aberdeen man Pawlett is just back from injury.Heading into the hostile atmosphere at Tannadice, with United fans taking up three sides of the stadium, the experience of players like Jamie Ness and Paul McGowan could be vital.Both have played at Ibrox and Parkhead in front of big, imposing crowds creating plenty of noise and, with teen sensation Fin Robertson likely to keep his place in the line-up, one or both of them may be needed to see the young lad through.Nothing has fazed the midfielder so far but a full house in a derby will be a whole new experience.Dundee have built a fairly young squad, meaning the likes of Forster, McGowan, Byrne, Ness and Hemmings may well make the dference."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"quot-weegie-birth-quot-andy-murray-greatest-glaswegian","story":"HE MAY be associated with everywhere from Dunblane to Wimbledon but Andy Murray was born in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"oscar-marzaroli-images-past-glasgow-life","story":"Kneeling in front of the old John Smithrsquos bookshop in Glasgowrsquos St Vincent Street is a boy.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives. There is also support for parents and carers.At SDS centres customers can get information, advice and guidance about jobs, the local labour market, training courses and apprenticeships as well as how to prepare for interviews and help with CVs and applications.The work of SDS careers advisers in schools and centres is supported by Scotland’s careers website myworldofwork, where you can access advice  hours a day. It is packed with career information, advice and tools such as the CV builder. There is also a dedicated exam results section.Details of the local SDS centres are available at myworldofwork centres and information about events and opportunities is also available on Facebook.Pauline Graham, Project Manager for the SDS Exam Results HelplineSir,I had a great time at this year#s Islay Show. It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead golf club junior championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowCongratulations to Lochgilphead Golf Club junior champion , Kern McKellar and Euan Gilmour, who was the Stableford winner."},{"url":null,"title":"lets get our mojo working","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStarting out in , Lost in Berlin is the creation of Ardrishaig-based wordsmith Russell Taylor.The name Lost in Berlin could be seen as an apt metaphor for society#s sometimes confused state.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"ardbeg bullock winner at islay cattle sale","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowUnited Auctions held its annual show and sale of autumn-born suckled calves at Islay Auction Mart on Friday August .A good show of calves was presented to show judge J Taylor, Easter Octhtermuthil.Winners were: Bullock class:  Ardbeg,  Kilchiaran,  Ardbeg Heer class:  and  Ardbeg Champion calf: Ardbeg bullock which takes the William A Low Trophy Reserve champion: Kilchiaran bullock.Overall, the bullocks sold to an average of £ per head or .p per kilo while the heers levelled out at £ per head or p per kilo.Principal lots and prices: Bullocks: AAx: £ and £– Ballimartin.

headquarters.Members of the union Unite are striking due to changes to their employment terms and conditions.Road workers descended on the local authority on the morning of Thursday August , to coincide with a full council meeting, and waved flags, shouted slogans and played lsquoMoney Money Moneyrsquo by ABBA on a PA system.Speaking at the demonstration, Willie Thomson, a regional industrial organiser for Unite, said that the dispute could risk the regionrsquos winter maintenance programme.He said: ldquoThe reason why the men are taking action is basically a refusal from Scottish Borders Council to respect the terms and conditions of their employment.ldquoThey have had changes imposed on them that will cost them poundrsquos, and they are not willing to have that done to them.ldquoThe reason they are striking is to send a strong message that the council needs to get back round the table and reach an agreement with the workers.ldquoThe people of the Scottish Borders need to be aware that the council is risking their winter maintenance service.ldquoDuring the winter maintenance service members do a lot of extra hours to keep up with the extra demand.ldquoWersquore now in a position where members will be withdrawing that programme.ldquoThat work is done a voluntary basis and the good will that is required to do that is in short supply.Currently, summer standby for Scottish Borders Councilrsquos road workers is voluntary, but council chiefs are trying to make this mandatory, in line with other sections of the council.Earlier this year, Scottish Borders Council notied the unions that not enforcing the same terms and conditions across the whole council could leave the local authority open to gender pay discrimination claims, as the mainly male roads section of the council is not required to be on standby over the summer, whereas the mainly female care home staff are.Summer standby payment for roads workers is currently pound., albeit it on a voluntary basis, and Scottish Borders Council is offering to up this to pound as long as it becomes mandatory.The two main unions which represent road workers at Scottish Borders Council, Unite and Unison, have been in discussion with the council ever since it informed employees that the terms and conditions would change.However, the talks with Unite broke down, and .% of the unionrsquos members who voted in an industrial ballot voted for strike action. The turn out was %.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos chief executive Tracey Logan,said: ldquoThe council has not changed terms and conditions for this staff group, nor have we failed to consult the trade unions or the staff affected.ldquoIn fact, we discovered some months ago that a small number of staff in this section had been claiming a higher rate of overtime than they were entitled to under the agreed terms and conditions.ldquoThey were also claiming for time to travel to work when working weekend overtime, which again is not in line with the agreement in place.ldquoGiven that Unite agreed to these terms and conditions, I am surprised and disappointed that they now want some of their members to be given more favourable pay rates than others, and for this small group be able to claim additional allowances that their other members cannot.ldquoIt is a principle of fairness and equality for staff across the whole workforce and one which I would expect Unite as representatives of staff to uphold and commit to."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-bar-cream-crop-scottish-cuisine","story":"A BAR and restaurant is the toast of Selkirk after winning the Best Scottish Cuisine title at Food Awards Scotland .The celebration of the countrys best restaurants, takeaways, pubs, hotel restaurants, cafes and bistros was held last week in Glasgow.Within the restaurant category it was the The Fleece Bar  Kitchen which was announced as cream of the crop when it comes to presenting Scottish cuisine.Trevor and Tracey Ward, who have owned the historic Selkirk inn since , were delighted with the latest accolade.Tracey told us: \"Wersquore absolutely delighted to have been awarded this accolade which celebrates the very best Scotland has to offer in the hospitality industry.\"To win the category of Best Scottish Cuisine when wersquore a family run restaurant situated in a small Borders town, is testament to the commitment and focus of our staff and the support we have from our customers and the community.\"There were some great, long established restaurants in our category and for us to have come out on top was a welcome surprise!Over the past three years the Wards, along with trainee chef son Ryan, have been rewarded with a regular stream of five-star reviews from delighted customers.And the awards shelf is filling up as quickly as their restaurant diary.Another Borders establishment which was also honoured last week at the Food Awards Scotland was Stewarts Cafe Bistro in Jedburgh.The High Street business was named as the regional Cafe Bistro winner.Creative Oceanic has been organising and hosting the awards for the past six years.CEO Irfan Younis told us: ldquoCongratulations to all winners and finalists at the sixth Food Awards Scotland .\"We welcomed and rewarded some of the best in the Scottish food industry who serve us up some of the tastiest food, enhance our culture, deliver top quality customer service and provide us with some of the best banter around.

The overall revenue budget for the upkeep of parks across the Borders is contained within the budget for neighbourhood services and no savings are projected from this budget as a result of the play programme.ldquoThe removal of old play equipment from playparks, which following appraisal, deemedto be low value facilities, will allow for sufficient resources to be deployed to maintain thenew facilities being invested in by the council through the outdoor community spacescapital project on an ongoing basis.ldquoThe new facilities include more pieces of equipment, widening access and providinghigher play value than the previous, aged, low-amenity, play equipment. Thedecommissioning of the older low value facilities will ensure the revenue impact to the parks and environment service budget is cost neutral.ldquoI would further confirm that no play park will be decommissioned until such times as thenew play park investment in that locality is complete.ldquoMembers should also note that no town or village which currently has a play park will beleft without one following the upgrade process.Tweeddale West councillor Heather Anderson also queried the council leader, asking for an update on the proposed closure of eleven parks in her ward.Councillor Haslam told the chamber: ldquoThe council requested feedback to the programme for decommissioning of play parks with an end date of August .ldquoOfficers will now undertake a review of the feedback and, where appropriate, respond prior to implementing the council decision.ldquoIn announcing a signicant investment in outdoor community facilities the council recognised the need to address the historic over provision of low value playparks, indeed the council is in amongst the largest providers of play parks per  head of population when compared to similar authorities, however when it comes to quality it is amongst the lowest in play value terms.ldquoThe council decision to invest in destination playparks and decommission those play parks which are obsolete does not remove the spaces from fulfilling an important community need in terms of access to open spaces.ldquoThese spaces can be used for informal play and have the potential to help the council address other issues such as its obligation to identy places for community food growing.Scottish Borders Council recently spent pound, on a new playpark at Harestanes Countryside Visitor Centre, near Ancrum, which follows on from new parks built in Galashiels, Oxton, and Stow.The council also opened up a new playpark in Hawick in  as part of the regeneration of WIlton Lodge Park, and Coldstream is set to be next to receive a new playpark with a pound, facility set to open in Home Park at the end of the month."},{"url":null,"title":"driving-legend-jackie-opens-museum-39-great-friend-39","story":"SIR Jackie Stewart praised Jim Clark as a driver and as a friend when he officially opened the refurbished Jim Clark Museum on Thursday in Duns.Clark won two Formula  World Championships, in  and , claiming overall a total of  Grand Prix victories with  pole starts, and also the Indianapolis  in  before he died in a horric crash at Hockenheim in .Sir Jackie, who later was flying off to Spain for the weekendrsquos Grand Prix, recalled his friendship with Clark.And he revealed how he regularly visited the Borders to meet up with his lsquogreat friend.He said: ldquoWhen Jim Clark was racing he was my hero and was certainly the best racing driver I ever raced against.\"We had a great le together and he was an enormous help to me.

The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really important to put your bucket down every now and then, and that can make it easier to empty as well."},{"url":null,"title":"say-future-dunbar-39-s-20mph-speed-limit","story":"A consultation ndash both online and through leaflets being posted through doors ndash is under way to seethe public want the reduced speed limit to remain in place.The speed limit on roads north of the East Coast Mainline was dropped from mph last summer, with an -month trial starting.That trial is due to end in late September and the council could look to make the lower speed limit permanent.However, feedback from members of the public on the change has been mixed, with a number questioning its effectiveness.George Robertson, from the townrsquos community council, stressed the consultation needed to be ldquothorough.He said: ldquoThe feedback has been very mixed some are in favour and quite a few are opposed.ldquoI think where we are at the moment is we have already talked as part of the community council to East Lothian Council to convince them that they need to do a comprehensive survey of local opinion in order to determine the way ahead.The townrsquos community council has been heavily involved in discussions surrounding the reduced speed limit in the town.Mr Robertson said original discussions looked at the speed limit on residential streets, such as Countess Road, being reduced to mph.At that time, the plan was for the greater speed limit ndash mph ndash to remain in place on, at least, sections of the main arterial routes, such as Belhaven Road, but they had their speed limit lowered too.Fellow community councillor Herbert Coutts has been firmly behind the calls for the reduced speed limit.He said: ldquoMy feeling is that the speed trial has been a useful exercise and that a considerable number of people have been law abiding and have observed the mph speed limit or near to it.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the consultation would focus mainly on whether the current streets covered by the limits should be made permanent or,not, what alternative would be preferred ndash space is also available to make suggestions of both removing streets or indeed adding streets.There is also the opportunity to add comments regarding speed limits in Hallhill, south of the railway line, which also has a near-blanket mph limit which is already permanent.Responses can be submitted online, while , leaflets will be posted through the doors of homes in Dunbar and West Barns.The spokeswoman said: ldquoThe introduction of the temporary mph limits was in response to community requests and the temporary traffic order gives an opportunity to assess whether itrsquos an option to be made permanent.ldquoThe consultation will seek the views not only of drivers but other road users and pedestrians. and we hope both residents and local businesses will take the opportunity to respond.The consultation is at east lothianconsultations infrastructure dunbar-north-mph-speed-limit"},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-sisters-debuting-edinburgh-festival-fringe","story":"Elaine and Katrina Hunter will stage a plethora of musical styles at their new show lsquoStar Inspirationsrsquo at Greenside @ Infirmary Street,  Infirmary Street, Forest Theatre, Venue , from this Monday to next Saturday .They will be joined by other cast members from Elainersquos Leith-based singing and performance coaching studio Vox Stars to celebrate aspiring singers.The sisters, who were born and bred in the Honest Toun at Newhailes, where they still live, come from a long line of fisherfolk.Their great grandmother Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Millar was known as the last creel-carrying fishwe in Scotland and went on to be awarded a British Empire Medal.Elaine, , whose stage name is Lainey Vox, said: ldquoWe grew up on the same street as our great grandmother and she encouraged our performing arts ventures, clapping and waving her hankie to our living room performances on top of her wee box.ldquoShe also loved nothing more than a chat about handbags and fashion over their Friday night fish dinners.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour.

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"poll-support-eu-holding-new-indyref-rises","story":"A survey of how people feel on Brexit found that only  per cent favour the decision to quit the European Union, while almost % now say they are against the plan.This compares to the % in Scotland who voted to leave in the  referendum, compared to  % who wished to remain.Furthermore, the ongoing threat of crashing out without a withdrawal deal and the doom-laden prophecies of disruption at ports, empty supermarket shelves and civil disruption means that more than one-in-ten Scots said they are now \"terried\" by the prospect.The survey, filled in by  Herald readers asked them to list their biggest concerns over plans to leave the EU, with a No Deal Brexit being ranked top by almost half of those who responded.:Johnson may have made independence completely inevitable says Nicola SturgeonOther their concerns were that Brexit would bring threats to the economy and jobs, disruption to NHS supplies are treatment, and boost the far right in Britain.Almost % were worried that it might lead to Scotland leaving the UK, although % are worried that the current impasse at Westminster may lead to Brexit being cancelled.The survey, predominantly filled in by those in the -and-over age group, was taken last Thursday before Prime Minister Boris Johnsons plan to suspend Parliament was revealed.Among reasons given for being concerned about Brexit, one said: \"Becoming a vassal state to Donald Trumps America\", while another was worried about the UK turning inward, saying: \"My children are half-Finnish and I fear for the rise in racist attitudes and othering that is being legitimised in the UK.\"The Leave campaign was criticised, with one respondent saying they were concerned about: \"The legitimising of hate crime, racism and \"English exceptionalism\" that has accompanied the Leave campaign and its aftermath\" along with \"The invoking of jingoistic notions that should have died years ago and the demonising of our closest allies.\":Scottish Tories hiding in their bunker after Johnson moves to suspend Commons#Another added: \"I worry that the UK in general and Scotland in particular risk being more separate from European countries and more isolated economically, culturally and socially.

Aged , Stevenson had already left his stamp on the nationrsquos most treacherous stretches of coastline when he completed the erection of a lighthouse on Little Cumbrae in the Clyde.He was in his mid-s and had already crafted plans for a Bell Rock lighthouse when the HMS York disaster prompted calls for it to be adopted.In a remarkable feat of endeavour and bravery, workmen defied the crashing waves surrounding the rock to begin their excavation work in .It would take four years of construction before the towerrsquos first beam of light shone ndash alerting countless sailors down the years to the risk and saving innumerable lives in the process.The m tall white and black lighthouse remains the worldrsquos oldest surviving sea-washed lighthouse, although its keepers moved out in  and its light is now operated from the Northern Lighthouse Board offices at  George Street ndash a short distance from Leith Street where the Stevenson family made their base.Robert Stevenson went on to serve for nearly  years as engineer to the Northern Lighthouse Board, overseeing the construction and improvements to lighthouses from Sumburgh Head in Shetland, to Barra Head at the southern entrance to The Minch and Scotlandrsquos southernmost point at the Mull of Galloway.His talent for civil engineering ran in the family: his sons, Alan, David and Thomas ndash father of Robert Louis Stevenson ndash would go on to follow in his footsteps.The brothersrsquo lighthouses stretch from the most northerly lighthouse in the British Isles at Muckle Flugga on the Island of Unst ndash  years old and still going strong - to the equally curiously named Chicken House lighthouse on an isolated rocky island at the southern tip of the Isle of Man.At the most isolated, Sule Skerry,  miles west of Orkney and designed to aid the passage of vessels through the Pentland Firth to and from the Iceland seas, keepers would spend a lonely month at a time with just seals, puffins and crashing waves for company.Perhaps the most challenging, however, was the construction of Skerryvore lighthouse. The graceful tower designed by Alan Stevenson is the tallest lighthouse in the country, measuring m of solid granite which were quarried on the Island of Mull throughout its six years of construction.Huge blocks of stone were ferried by tender to Hynish on Tiree to be dressed and shaped to ensure they fitted perfectly into place, before being taken to the site overlooking a reef of

cities produce around three quarters of the worldrsquos GDP and greenhouse gas emissions. They are also home to half the worldrsquos population ndash a figure that is expected to rise to between % and % by .In April this year, the Glasgow headquartered firm, Integrated Environmental Solutions IES Ltd, which has spent  years analysing the energy use and environmental impact of buildings, released a software suite designed to model multiple buildings simultaneously. These Intelligent Communities Lecycletools are already being used to monitor and model the impact and energy use of campuses, communities and cities.Dr Sarah Graham, ICL Consultant at IES says the software will enable people to create a digital representation of any group of buildings and their networks. This facilitates the planning and coordination of developments as they evolve, lessening their impact.ldquoThe idea is to provide a toolset that can address the problem of climate change on a citywide scale, she says. ldquoWe can create a live, D twin of any built environment to facilitate planning for the future. The model includes the buildings and the networks they run on, such as the electricity, water and gas, Graham explains.IES was founded in Scotland, on  June , by the current managing director, Dr Don Mclean. Its software and consultancy expertise are already in use by clients around the world, and the firm now employs over  staff. In addition to its Glasgow HQ, IES has offices in Dublin, Atlanta and Singapore, and representatives around the world, particularly in Australia, Europe and the Middle East.ldquoOur clients are major multi-disciplinary design firms around the world, along with universities, councils, corporations and city authorities. We do compliance work in a number of countries and we have a strong focus on optimising the design and operation of any building project. The tools enable lsquowhat rsquo scenarios to be tested at the design stage, and throughout the operational le cycle of the development, she explains.IESrsquos software can import metered data eg BMS, and AMR sensor data to model the dynamics of operation of a building or system which is a characteristic of a true digital twin.A virtual lsquotwinrsquo will test-run scenarios to identy optimal investments and improvements.As Graham explains, large buildings typically generate huge amounts of data from air conditioning, sensors and utility meters. The sheer volume of data makes it dficult for estate managers to make effective interventions. The ability to visualise all of the data on a single  uncovers unknown issues and opportunities for improvement.ldquoModelling the building management data in real time in a buildingrsquos D digital twin enables us to get an in-depth understanding of how the building is performing and what can be done to improve its performance, as we can virtually test dferent options. Clients are interested in how they can achieve zero carbon targets quickly and cost effectively.ldquoThe leaders of a university, or the management team at a hospital are faced with having to evaluate dferent potential solutions. Our software helps them model solutions, such as installing wind turbines, modying buildings, or incorporating energy storage, she notes.IES has helped organisations around the world to solve these kinds of queries. Another good example is a recent project at Dundalk Institute of Technology in Ireland where a team of students and researchers worked with support from IES. They factored in the cost of three options against their carbon targets to understand how best to invest. Graham also points to the Nanyang Technology University in Singapore, which has become the first ICL Living Lab, creating a full D model of the campus. This helps them to ensure that the buildings are all operating optimally and allows them to test Energy Conservation Measures already installed to decide how to achieve further savings.ldquoWhere we are dealing with a lot of building sensor data we use AI and machine learning to help to process that information, we can simply the view the management team get and customise it to what they want, thus reducing the burden on those iniduals. With the Internet of Things there will be more and more data available so itrsquos important we have robust means of capturing and processing that data and using the insights to inform decisions or drive the building systems. Think of the Hive control for home heating systems but on a much larger scale.Another recent example is the work IES has done on Orkney. ldquoA number of Scottish islands are off the grid and the communities see a benefit in being self-sufficient as far as electricity generation is concerned, Graham explains.The ICL tools can be used to model the energy demands and generation, at the same time, create a portal for the community to engage with the data. An example of this is Nottingham Trent Basin ndash a major residential development project. The project runs a PVarray with the largest storage battery in Europe. IES has created a model which residents can interact with via apps on phones or via a -inch screen on site. Researchers from Nottingham Trent University are involved in demonstrating the benefits of making the data accessible in order to mody behaviours to reduce electricity use.The way people behave inside a building or a cluster of buildings, has a major influence on emissions, she points out. ldquoWhen you know how a building is performing you can start incentivising iniduals to move towards a more responsible use of energy. This can have a really positive impact in the drive towards decarbonsation, she notes.With the Scottish Government having set a ldquonet zero-carbon target for Scotland to achieve by , the software clearly has a valuable role to play in helping local authorities and cities to get to grips with their emissions.ldquoCreating a virtual, digital twin of a campus, or even of a city, is a powerful way of understanding the dynamics and identying opportunities. To quote Lord Kelvin lsquoIf we donrsquot measure it we canrsquot improve itrsquo. Using the ICL any stakeholder can gain an understanding of the impact they and the built environment is having on the environment, Graham notes."},{"url":null,"title":"judge-dismisses-bid-halt-parliament-suspension-plans","story":"A group of  parliamentarians were seeking an interim interdict - similar to an injunction - at the Court of Session ahead of a full hearing.:Outcome of legal challenges to Parliament suspension to be revealed\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"description\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer thumbs HmvlMKk-.jpg\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests HmvlMKk.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": This aimed at halting prorogation until a final decision has been made on the case.But on Friday, Judge Lord Doherty dismissed the motionahead of a full hearing next week.:Civil disobedience and strikes threatened in mass Brexit protestsMr Johnson announced earlier this week that Parliament was being suspended for five weeks from mid September.Lord Doherty said he was ldquonot satisfied that it has been demonstrated that therersquos a need for an interim suspension or an interim interdict to be granted at this stage.He said a substantive hearing was already set to place on Friday September  ldquobefore the first possible date parliament could be prorogued.But he brought that hearing forward to Tuesday September  ldquoin the interest of justice.Aiden OrsquoNeill QC, representing those for the action, had argued for the substantive hearing to be moved forward.He said: ldquoThere is an urgency to this ndash any delay is prejudicial ndash not just to the prejudice of the petitioners, but to the country as a whole.Lord Doherty said: ldquoIrsquom going to move the substantive hearing forward to Tuesday.ldquoWeighing consideration in the balance, itrsquos in the interest of justice that it proceeds sooner rather than later.The decision came after the Queen approved Mr Johnsonrsquos request for Parliament to be suspended for five weeks.On Thursday, the judge heard arguments from a lawyer for the campaigners ndash led by SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson and aided by Jo Maugham of the Good Law Project ndash and from a legal representative for the UK Government.Mr OrsquoNeill QC urged the court to step in and stop the suspension of Parliament, arguing it would prevent an ldquoabusive and ldquounconstitutional use of government powers.However, Roddy Dunlop QC, representing the UK Government, called on the judge to reject the request, as the Queen has already prorogued Parliament and there is ldquono reason to have an interim decision on such an important matter.Responding to Lord Dohertyrsquos decision on Friday, a government spokesperson said: ldquoAs we have set out, the government needs to bring forward a strong domestic legislative agenda and MPs are not prevented from scrutinising our withdrawal from the EU.ldquoWe are glad the court found against the interdict ndash there was no good reason to seek one, given the full hearing is due to take place next week, and the process of bringing the session to an end will not start until the week commencing September ."},{"url":null,"title":"theatre-tay-bridge-dundee-rep-neil-cooper-four-stars","story":"Tay BridgeDundee RepNeil CooperFour starsSTRANGERS on a train are destined for disaster in Peter Arnottrsquos new play, which marks this Decemberrsquos forthcoming th anniversary of the  Tay Bridge tragedy.

The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Traffic-calming measures will run in tandem with the part-time  zone outside Kintore Primary School\"  Councillors make policy change to improve Kintore School safetyviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said armed forces personnel make huge sacrices to keep us all safe\"  Aberdeenshire Council achieves gold award for work with armed forces, families, veterans and cadets viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"oor wullie big bucket trail to visit inverurie","story":"Cartoon favourite Oor Wullie will make his way to Inverurie this summer as part of his charity Big Bucket Trail.The town and local area will house seven sculptures as part of the first ever nationwide trail raising money for The ARCHIE Foundation, the official charity of Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital.Across Scotland,  Oor Wullies will be found on the streets of Aberdeen, Inverness, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow.A portion of those have been allocated to Inverurie thanks to the help of local businesses.GPH Builders Merchants, Inverurie Precast, ANM Group, Tarmac, Barra Berries, the Inverurie panto and the town’s Business Improvement District have each sponsored a sculpture, with funds going to benefit sick children in Grampian.Six Oor Wullies will be found in the town, while one will be ready to discover in Oldmeldrum.Derek Ritchie, manager of Inverurie BID, said: “We are absolutely delighted that the town will be hosting a number of sculptures this summer.

The devices were first introduced in Tayside in June this year and they were subsequently introduced in the North East in July.The mobiles will provide apps enabling officers carry out checks and file crime reports. Officers will also be able to type statements directly to the device through the use of its digital notebookPronto which will obtain an electronic signature from victims and witnesses.Chief Superintendent George Macdonald, Highland and Islands isional commander, said: #The introduction of mobile technology is a major milestone which will positively enhance the operational policing approach in the Highland and Islands.#Over the last two years, we have seen a signicant investment and upgrade in our IT systems to enable us to take advantage of technology.#Given the geography of the area, officers do incur signicant travel time between calls and their stations, the mobile device will allow officers to be more visible in the community, spend more time on patrol and hopefully be more accessible within the areas they serve.#Members of the public will see police officers operating their mobile device in public areas. It is important they understand they are not using their personal telephone and that they are working, but be reassured they will always be available to offer help, advice or assistanceneeded.#Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Humza Yousaf  is pleased that the Scottish Government has been able to help Police Scotland invest in new mobile technology, which he believes will enable officers to work in the heart of Scotland’s communities, providing reassurance and increasing their visibility.“This technology is enabling officers to become even more agile and responsive, ensuring the service is better-equipped to meet the modern-day demands upon it,# he said.#Being able to access information at their fingertips will improve the ability of officers in the Highlands and Islands to react promptly to a range of issues they encounter, enhancing the amount of time available to spend in the heart of their communities and keeping people safe.”Susan Deacon, Chair of the Scottish Police Authorityfeels that this is an important and much needed step forward.#The introduction of mobile working will bring real benefits to the police and the public and will make the police service more responsive, visible and efficient,# she explained.#Continued investment in technology is vital to ensure that policing in Scotland keeps pace with changing needs and demands. Communities across Scotland will be better protected as a result of these changes.#The £million Mobile Working Project which was part funded by the Scottish Government’s capital budget allocation will see approximately , of Police Scotland’s unormed officers issued with mobile devices by spring .The devices will be further enhanced over time with the addition of future policing applications, including national systems as they become available.Last year, Police Scotland produced a business case for a major investment in digital, data and ICT over  years to modernise the service. The proposed investment would also generate savings and public service improvements for the wider criminal justice system justice system.David Wallace, BT’s public sector director in Scotland and chair of the BT board in Scotland, said: “We’re pleased to be leading this project, bringing in our EE mobile network – the largest G network in the UK – and our unrivalled resources to help Police Scotland transform the way they work.“By helping our customers take advantage of BT’s investments in innovations and networking, including our launch of G in Scotland, we’ll see opportunities we couldn’t imagine ten years ago come into our lives.”Norman Dixon, Motorola Solutions# Account Director for Scotland added: “The Pronto mobile application replaces the paper notebook and modernises police workflows by giving them access to databases and tools on their mobile device on the beat.

Craig Clouston and Callan Jessiman were tasked with anchoring the midfield for Hotspurs, while Rovers lined up in a --, spearheaded by Steven Tulloch and Zack Singh.The opening stages were cagey, as the two teams felt each out. The big talking point of the opening half hour was an agricultural challenge by Scott Drever in the Rovers midfield. He went over the top of the ball on Jordan Low in the middle of the park, an offence referee Mike Cursiter saw fit to issue a caution to the midfielder, with Hotspurs looking for a red.Aiden Drever saw a free-kick go narrowly wide of Davy Leonard#s post after  minutes, while Tulloch might have done better with a half chance just before the half-time whistle. A driven ball from Graeme Horne on the left was nodded on by Singh, but the veteran Rovers striker couldn#t direct his header on target, with Hotspurs appealing for an offside flag.The match remained goalless at the break, with neither team having really got going.The match was soon to kick into le in the second half. After  minutes, Rovers ‘keeper Liam Valentine made a hash of a clearance, booting the ball against Spurs striker Jerry McBeth. With the goal gaping, the Hotspurs striker was just about to pull the trigger when he was tripped by Valentine.Cursiter awarded the free-kick, and after a long consultation with his linesman, deemed the challenge worthy of a yellow card only, despite the protestations of the away side. Joe Wilson#s effort from the set piece was tipped wide by the ‘keeper.Just before the hour mark, Rovers saw their best chance come and go. A long ball found Connan Rendall on the right, who controlled it wonderfully before shuffling inside to the edge of the box. His drilled effort looked every inch a goal until Leonard flung himself down to his left to tip it round the post.Moments later, the breakthrough was to come at the other end, as the match swung from end-to-end.Aiden Drever was penalised for a foul on Logan Peace wide on Hotspurs left. The free-kick was flighted in but cleared out to Joe Wilson. His cross back in found Hotspurs legend Wayne Monkman at the back post, whose header floated over the stranded Valentine for the opening goal. Could Monkman#s goal be the fairytale ending for the defender on his final Hotspurs appearance Rovers now needed to score twice in the last  minutes to win the title, but in truth they found a well-marshalled away defence dficult to break down. Hotspurs had the bit between their teeth, with a first ‘A’ League title since  now tantalisingly close.The hosts# task was made even more challenging when Aiden Drever was sent off for two bookings in quick succession with  minutes to go. From there, Hotspurs saw out the game relatively comfortably.In the th minute, Valentine got caught underneath a high ball into the box, dropping it at the feet of substitute Jack Paterson. As the sub tried to get a shot away, he was impeded by the Rovers goalie, who saw his second yellow card of the evening to ensure his side would finish with nine men.Seventeen-year-old midfielder Jessiman stepped up to coolly slot away the resultant penalty, ensuring Hotspurs would win the  ‘A’ League, and sparking scenes of delight amongst their support on the sidelines.OAFA president Colin MacLeod paid tribute to both sides for a hard-fought league campaign after the match, and invited up Hotspurs skipper Keith Harcus to receive the Brough Cup for his side.Harcus — standing in for the injured Owen Rendall — paid tribute to his centre-back partner Monkman who is set to bow out of domestic football as an ‘A’ League champion and urged his teammates not to go another  years before landing the biggest prize in domestic football.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I have never seen it as bad.”My source was not exaggerating, but I could not believe the extent of it. The ScotRail Journeycheck website even advised passengers to “make their own travel arrangements” because of overcrowding between Edinburgh’s main station and Haymarket. That was simply extraordinary.The industry staffer who texted me painted an alarming picture that was repeated in many messages, photos and videos posted by passengers on social media into the night. “Cancelled trains lots” came the next text from my source. “Hundreds of passengers not able to get on services, police at almost every train for crowd control...no management in attendance...I can’t keep up with the disruption.”But even with Edinburgh Festival crowds and a Scotland v France rugby match at Murrayfield, how could this have happened  ScotRail is highly experienced at dealing with crowds from big events and, with new trains, it’s never had so many carriages on main lines from the capital such as to Glasgow and Dunblane.We await the findings of ScotRail’s internal inquiry, but it appears that a “perfect storm” of circumstances contributed to what appears to have resulted in near chaos, according to its definition as “complete disorder and confusion”.ScotRail operations director David Simpson said: “A number of unexpected incidents caused signicant issues on the network, with a trespassing incident and a train fault adding to a handful of cancellations following some late call offs.”Trains are understood to have been halted on a secondary Edinburgh-Glasgow line at Curriehill in western Edinburgh, and a train on the main line between the cities was stopped for  minutes at Linlithgow after a passenger activated an alarm because of the crush on board and the driver was unable to release the brakes.I have been told that two drivers’ shts had also not been covered and last-minute replacements had to be found, although ScotRail has not made clear whether this caused any further cancellations.On the basis of what we know so far and what I have been told from within the rail industry, two conclusions can be drawn.First, Saturday’s events demonstrate once again that the railways are a sitting duck, prone to disruption from a wide range of causes over which they have no control. This can be anything from people straying onto tracks, as happened, to others, all too often, taking their own lives. Trees on adjoining land can blow down, damaging overhead power lines. Even fires in nearby garages have stopped services because of explosion dangers.Trains can’t steer round obstacles like on the roads, and there are often no ersion routes.But secondly, I hear that despite ScotRail’s new trains and recruiting more staff, it still has limited resilience when situations escalate.While many of its new electric fleet has arrived, most of the refurbished diesel trains for long distance inter-city routes have yet to go into service because of problems with upgrading work by other firms. There are also still not enough additional drivers yet trained.A further factor is that despite all the disruption, ScotRail is still seeing underlying passenger growth.

No-one who attended the Scottish Conservative Conference in Aberdeen in May would have failed to notice the warmth, affection and relief when Ruth Davidson delivered a barn-storming speech to mark herfrom maternity leave plenty of raw meat to gee up the members but also packed with policy initiatives to signal she was a leader with a plan for government.But those who knew how much Ruth valued her family le, who knew a family of her own is something she has cherished for years, wondered how she could maintain the same energy, enthusiasm and political stamina which had brought her UK-wide prominence over the previous eight years. She also faced going back to being on the receiving end of a daily torrent of social media abuse, but, for the first time, with hardline Brexiteers amongst them.Politics cost her a long-term relationship at the start of her leadership and so she was fully aware of the toll it can take. Even before the arrival of her baby son it was clear that her personal well-being was an absolute priority.This week’s political events have had nothing to do with her decision but, as her resignation letter made clear, it was everything to do with the prospect of a general election, a Scottish election and maybe even two referendums. After eight years on the front line of campaign after campaign she has, as they say in sport, left nothing on the pitch.The debt the Scottish party owes her is enormous, illustrated by the army of elected representatives, amongst whom I am one, but there is no point looking for the next Ruth Davidson because we will never find one. Nor is it a second chance for Murdo Fraser to grab the prize some of his followers still believe was snatched from his grasp in . This leadership contest should not be is an inward-looking wrangle about the shape of the party, but a fight for the Union and the promotion of a right-of-centre programme with wealth creation for all at its heart. We need to see it as an opportunity, not a threat. The new leader must come from the new generation which has developed under her leadership.For Ruth, her skills as a communicator will surely mean she has a very bright future for le after politics, but all that matters is that she, Jen and Finn are content.

So far they have footed the bill for the company and its projects.Dr Chivers# expertise on Shetland boats and boat use has been combined with Dr Renwick’s work on community monitoring of eroding coastal archaeology to create a pilot project recording the boat noosts of Burra, and their stories, with a view to expanding this to a Shetland-wide project.Moder Dy archaeologist Dr Renwick said: “Folk are getting older, those who remember the days where everyone had a small boat are sadly getting fewer. Climate change is speeding up sea level rise and the increasing regularity of violent storm events means the coastal archaeology is also rapidly vanishing.#Please help us record the sites and the stories of everyday maritime Shetland before it is too late.”Moder Dy is run entirely voluntarily with the non-financial support of Shetland Amenity Trust, Archaeology Shetland and Scotland’s Coastal Heritage at Risk .

Matt Aumlkerfeldt worked as Nikolaj Coster-Waldau’sstand in and body double from  to the show’s grand end this year. Caution - Contains spoilersyou haven’t watched the final season yet!Matt applied to be an extra on the show when it first came to Northern Ireland then ended up landing a full on role.“I did a few days of extra work and then got noticed by the casting staff as I bore a resemblance to Nikolaj, who played Jamie Lannister.“Most of my measurements were the same as him, down to even my hand size which was vital from season three as Jamie has his hand cut off. “I worked about  days a year on the show and then during season eight I was there pretty much every day!”In ‘real le’, Matt, who is , loves working in the Fairhill branch of Cafe Nero’s.  Born in Sweden, Matt moved to Northern Ireland when he was a child with his mum. He has adopted the Ballymena area as his home and says Game of Thrones helped keep him here. He explained: “I would get in before all the other cast and crew and have a rough idea of what scenes were going to be shot that day. I’d then go over them with the director and the camera guys plus the director of photography.“I’d be given some direction and then take part in crew rehearsals. After this would be the full rehearsal with all the extras, so by the time the main cast come on set I’ve probably gone through the scene about  times!“Nikolaj would then come on and get some short notes from the director before I’d also give him notes as I’ve already ran the scene. My face is never actually recorded on camera but I’ve been in every one of his scenes. “Working then as a body double was dferent. When doing this I dressed up in the character of Jamie and picked up the shots.“This even applied to the nude scenes, which I was comfortable with as I’m not really a shy person and don’t get nervous easily!”Although it would be practically impossible to tell the dference between Matt and Nikolaj on screen, Matt said: “I know all the scenes I did and,anything, it’s a bit illusion breaking as I also know what’s behind the scene!”So what was Matt’s favourite moment from the whole Game of Thrones season  His answer was the iconic trial of Jamie Lannister in Season .“All the main cast were together,” Matt explained.“On that day Nikolaj got wrapped early so when he’s not on screen all the actors are actually looking at me and I was delivering his lines to them. “I had this amazing line up of actors looking at me. It was a big moment in the whole series and I suppose I was relatively nervous!“When action is called, it’s like your le stops, you’re no longer in this world you feel you’re actually in Westeros. Then when cut is called everyone is back to normal. It’s amazingnot a little weird!”Being a body double meant that Matt wore the original costumes.“I wore Nikolaj’s costume alot, including the armour which is real.“I had to keep my body a certain shape so as to fit it plus I did have to keep pretty fit to carry it.“When we started working with the gold hand, my own arm was strapped behind my back, which was pretty uncomfortable, but the fake arm was amazing. It looked very real, down to the pours and hair on the skin.”It’s no secret that the last season of Game of Thrones was surrounded in secrecy! So how did Matt handle keeping the secret that almost  million people wanted to know He revealed: “I certainly didn’t tell too many people!“For nine years I kept all the secrets of the show and, especially in the last season it really was such a burden as there were so many consperies. It became hard to not talk about it and I really just wanted to tell someone about it.”Many of the ludicrous rumours about how the show would end were indeed , however Matt did confirm that scripts were destroyed after each scene was filmed.He said: “There were hundreds of people in the crew during the last season so it got to the point that sets were closed.“There was also misinformation circulated. One part of the crew would be told a certain detail about a scene or filming while another would be told something , all just to throw people off the scent of what was really going on.  “On one occasion Nikolaj went to Seville just so as people would think he was filming there when infact he wasn’t.”Final EpisodeThe final episode and season was met with much acclaim but it wasn’t without some negative reviews. Many people thought the ending wasn’t as dramatic as should have been, and some were left disappointed.To a certain extent, Matt agrees.“I think there was alot of character progression over the years that was forgotten about or pushed aside during the final season, and perhaps some characters could have had a more gloried end. “Perhaps the writers were concentrating on dferent projects. “My view was that this was the last season, we should have gone all out!”On Jamie’s last scene, where he died under a pile of rubble in the arms of his sister, Matt has his own philosophy.“In my head I’d like to think that Jamie was actually going to kill Cersei so as he could have a proper future with Brienne of Tarth.”Matt talks fondly of all the cast members, especially Nikolaj.He said: “I love Nikolaj. I obviously spent alot of time with him and I went to the wrap party which was great too.Gwendoline Christie, who played Brienne of Tarth was a lovely lady and I was friends with Jacob Anderson who played Greyworm. I got to know everyone well and generally everyone was really nice.” Le after Game of ThronesThe future is certainly bright for Matt as he aspires to get more recognised as an actor.“Currently I’m working at the Game of Thrones exhibition in Belfast and doing some photography work.“I’ve started a series of YouTube videos going round the Thrones locations in Northern Ireland and explaining them.“I recently did a video from Cushendun caves, which is special to me as it’s actually where Nikolaj and I had our last scene together.“From that I was noticed by a writer, currently writing a movie and was sent the script. So I potentially have the opportunity to be part of the main cast for that upcoming movie. “I don’t have an agent as I need a showreel of me infront of the camera, sothis movie works out I’ll get the showreel then hopefully an agent and we’ll see where it goes from there.“I also really want to keep my job in Nero’s as I love it there!”Looking back, Matt had such a great experience working on Thrones.“It was a great nine years! But when it all aired and all the secrets were out I felt really free. It was like a car had been lted off my shoulders as there was so much information I had to keep to myself!”Matt still hasn’t watched the final season on TV.“I still miss it as it was better than anything I’ve worked on before but I’ll watch it at some point, I know what happens at the end of the day!” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2228521.jpg--.jpg?1567156924000\n","title":"j p corry site re opens","story":"Local builders’ merchants, JP Corry, officially reopened its’ Ballymenabranch on Monday th August following a devastating fire that closed the site just  weeks ago.

However, he says that he hopes his run will raise awareness of mental health issues and suicide.“I’ve done several charitable runs in the past, but my main inspiration has been kids who have a certain condition and affliction and their parents seem quite helpless,” he explains.“I felt I couldn’t really help them in any way, so the only thing I could think of was to run to raise money for the charities that help them. I hate running, but it’s the only way I could help – I can’t do anything like a doctor would do or a counsellor would do.“Unfortunately depression, anxiety, suicide and mental health issues are getting worse in Northern Ireland, especially around West Belfast and North Belfast, which is really, really sad. For many people they don’t feel like they can talk to anyone or that they can speak up, because there’s still a lot of stigma attached to it, which is wrong. “We all go through issues, we all have problems – others might be better able to deal with them men in particular struggle to open up, but we all need to offload. If you have a toothache you’ll go to the dentist before it falls out,you have a sore leg you’ll go to the doctor before it breaks, but people ignore every sign from their minds that they need help. “It will help you in the long run and there is help available. There are charities that do it for free and they offer an amazing service. I myself have availed of it. I went to see a counsellor when I was having a tough time of it, and somebody took me aside and said ‘you need help’ and I’m glad I did, otherwise I might have been more unfortunate. “Depression is indiscriminate, whether you’re rich or poor, young or old, it can affect everyone. It’s important to be sympathetic to someone in that situation, because it could be you, your best friend or family member that needs that help. Hopefully, this run will be able to raise more awareness about these issues.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sdlps eastwood calls on mps to vote down tory government","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We should all work towards getting a consensus on a withdrawal agreement. If anything, it is the backstop which provides the greatest threat to the Belfast Agreement.\"Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said the move illustrates the \"arrogance\" and \"contempt\" of the Conservatives.She added: \"Todays move demonstrates clear intent to force through a no-deal Brexit, regardless of the consequences for Ireland, north or south.\"It shows the arrogance of the British Government and their contempt even for their own political institutions and it is very clear that Irish interests will never be protected at Westminster. \"The Tories have shown a total and callous disregard for our country and the democratically expressed wishes of the people of the north to remain in the EU.\"Sinn Fein will continue to stand up for our interests against Tory Brexiteers and their catastrophic Brexit agenda.\"Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said it meant a no-deal Brexit is now the most likely outcome and that Irish interests were not being protected.But DUP MLA Gordon Lyons hit out at Sinn Feins criticism, citing the more than two-year Stormont impasse. He said: \"Sinn Fein have a cheek to complain about the prorogation of Parliament, meaning that it will be sitting for four fewer days than would otherwise have been the case, when they have been responsible for the Assembly being closed for the last two and a half years.\"Mr Eastwood, meanwhile, slammed Mr Johnson for acting like \"a tin-pot dictator\", describing the move as \"disgraceful\" and \"anti-democratic\".\"Proroguing your parliament to enforce the will of a government that has no democratic legitimacy for an act that has no majority support is the behaviour of a tin-pot dictator,\" he said.And in his letter to MPs last night, he wrote: \"It is now clear that Boris Johnson does not understand the fragile complexities that underpin peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland. More worrying, however, he clearly doesnt care. \"As the leader of a party that played a signicant role in forging the Good Friday Agreement through dficult but courageous compromise, I am appealing to you to help protect the progress we have made.\"In these circumstances, I would urge you to back a motion of no confidence in Boris Johnson as Prime Minister.\"The British Governments actions undermine its role as a guarantor of peace and stability in Northern Ireland. It should not, therefore, command the confidence of MPs.\"Alliance leader Naomi Long called the suspension of Parliament a \"cowardly and outrageous\" move, which \"follows in the footsteps of other dictators\".\"This is more akin to something seen in an authoritarian state,\" she said.\"We have been told Brexit was about taking back control. However, parliamentary democracy is being undermined and sacriced on the altar of Brexit, which puts us in extremely dangerous territory.\"It is the desperate act of a Prime Minister who knows Parliament opposes a no-deal but who will attempt to push it through regardless.\"It is utterly appalling the DUP are giving cover to this Parliamentary coup, when they know full well the severe effects a reckless no-deal will have on Northern Ireland.\"TUV leader Jim Allister welcomed Mr Johnsons move, saying it is \"time to get on with getting out\". He added: \"Three years on, the patience of the people has been exhausted.\"Todays news would appear to bring us closer to implementing the will of the people. Assuming it plays out like that, today will be remembered as a good day for democracy.\""},{"url":null,"title":"amber rudd northern ireland businesses and workers have every right to feel optimistic about future","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Local employment is at a record high with , more people in a job since , and unemployment is just .% - below the UK average of .%. Even fewer women are out of work in Northern Ireland, just .%, with women making up well over half of new workers in that time.Yesterday I met some of the organisations in Belfast helping to drive that employment boom. In particular with Youth Action Northern Ireland, who work with , young people every year, helping them to build future careers in areas like performing arts, business and technology.As the Work and Pensions Secretary Im responsible for overseeing the welfare reforms that are helping more people get into work, with Universal Credit offering every jobseeker a personal work coach and the tailored support they need to overcome whatever barriers they face.Following the Fresh Start Agreement, Universal Credit was introduced here as well in the last few years.On my visit I met with officials from the Department for Communities working to make sure people here experience a smooth transition to the new system, benefiting from its flexibility and simplicity.Its right that issues like welfare reform, which have such a big impact on the people of Northern Ireland, are decided on by their representatives here in Stormont.So like the rest of the Government, I also urge the political parties in Northern Ireland to work quickly to restore devolved government at Stormont. The people of Northern Ireland need to have confidence that decisions are being made by local politicians who represent them.Businesses certainly have confidence in Northern Ireland workers. In the last four years alone over , more people have been employed by private companies here. As weve created a more favourable business environment across the UK, easing regulation and lowering corporation tax, weve seen private enterprise flourish. There are , businesses based in Northern Ireland, almost , more than there were in . Yesterday I also met some of the  entrepreneurs creating new businesses here in Belfast with the help of Catalyst - a charity offering mentoring support and office space to new start-ups.Based at Belfasts historic docks near the Game of Thrones studios, it is a prime example of how Northern Irelands former industrial centre is becoming a new economic powerhouse for arts and technology.Im also encouraged by public signs from Harland  Wolffs administrators looking for a new buyer for the company.As the Northern Ireland Secretary has said, while its a commercial process, the Government will do all it can to support a successful bid. Jobseekers in Northern Ireland should be optimistic about their future.Wages are rising faster than the UK average and workers here earn an average of £ a week more than they did five years ago. Employment is booming.Game of Thrones has ended, and like many fans I was sad to say goodbye to Westeros. But with the worlds most popular TV programme creating a legacy for its arts and entertainment industry, with its new wave of entrepreneurs and with near full-employment, Im confident that optimism is well founded."},{"url":null,"title":"campaigner vows to continue n ireland legal bid to block prorogation","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Boris Johnson knows that himself. I think he’s trying to use the lack of time for his own advantage.”Mr McCord insisted the Scottish case was dferent to his.“We have dferent points, the Scottish people in their argument there’s no mention of the Good Friday Agreement, which is a big point here for us,” he said.He branded Mr Johnson’s decision “undemocratic”.“We have got a Prime Minister who wants to force Brexit through with no deal,” he said.“He also has decided to help him do that to bring in a scheme and system and his own ways of suspending Parliament.“People have said it has happened before – not for theof time and not for the same reasons. This is a Prime Minister who will do anything to get his own way without concerns for the people of Northern Ireland and the peace process.”"},{"url":null,"title":"eu ready for more brexit talks but uk needs new backstop plan simon coveney","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said training was promised in May after the application was made to the organisation.\"We didnt hear anything over the summer, even through we sent  plus emails.\"The only communication we had was when we were told the member of staff dealing with our application had changed department.\"We were given two new contacts in May but we never get any reply from them.\"We were then told our application had been lost.\"Johnny said there were similar problems when Holly, who also uses a wheelchair, started nursery school last year.\"My concern is well have this problem every year going forward because her needs are always changing.\"They need to get these things sorted, its not like its sprung on them - theyve known for a long time that this needs to be done,\" he said.Hollys father said his daughter feels dferent enough and the complications around her attending school had upset her.\"Shes had a tough start to le and first had surgery when she was four days old. Shes had six or seven surgeries so far - brain surgery and shes due another one this year to resolve issues with her back. She has all these issues but shes as happy as any other five year old.\"Like any parents, we want everything for her and well do anything to achieve that. We chose that school because we believe they can give the support and help her grow. I cant fault the school at all,\" he said.\"Theyve gone above and beyond to try and be able to get everything in place. Theyre just not getting the support from them.\"Johnny said after the Nolan Show contacted the Education Authority he was told the equipment required would be delivered on Monday and training done as soon as possible.\"I can only relate the training to the training they received in Hollys nursery school and it takes a day. In terms of when its going to be done, they still have to come back to me on it,\" he said.\"They say it will be a priority but they cant give me any specics as to when it will be done.\"\"Were still hopeful we can get this sorted. As parents, were used to being let down by government bodies, but its more upsetting for Holly because shes feeling even more dferent than she is.\"The Education Authority has been contacted for comment. It told the Nolan Show it could not comment on the circumstances of inidual children. \"When the specic needs of children are being assessed, this will include any additional equipment or support they may require,\" a statement said.\"The Education Authority works closely with parents and schools to achieve the best possible outcome to ensure that the special needs of children are met.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest delays and diversions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I understand residents’ concerns, but I do believewe believe in the value of human le we have to value all lives, we can’t pick and choose who is ill and who isn’t.”More than  supervised injection sites operate globally, mainly in Europe, Canada and Australia. A  study of  sites in North America found that injection rooms fulfilled their harm-reduction objectives, and were not found to increase drug use or crime.Upon the rejection from Dublin City Council, there was considerable public outcry, with accusations of a “not in my backyard” mentality from those who objected.The Minister said the answer to community objection is education on the issue.“This is in my back yard I’m glad to say, there will always people who will have concerns, the most important thing is to give people as much information as possible,” she added.“The people using the rooms would probably live in the area, and it’s about not having to see newspapers in the morning telling us that someone was found dead in a laneway.“At the moment, people are openly injecting, it will take them off the streets and take them into a medically supervised facility, where they can access supports and out of the public eye.“I wouldn’t want my children passing people injecting, with needles and other paraphernalia lying around.“My issue with Dubin City Council is they’re not seeing the bigger picture, and how this will enhance the community.“This is a le and death matter. I am working with Dublin City Council, the HSE and Merchants Quay Ireland to deliver and open this facility as soon as possible.”Plans for the room are currently on appeal with Bord Pleanala, and a decision is due in late December.The latest Health Research Board National Drug-Related Deaths Index shows that a total of  people died from drug-related deaths in Ireland in  compared to  in  – representing an increase of %.Half of all deaths in  were people aged  or younger.The majority of heroin overdoses were in Dublin city.Opiate users and their families are now being offered training on the dangers of an overdose and how to administer Naloxone, which can reverse the effect of an overdose temporarily."},{"url":null,"title":"calais port to stage nodeal brexit practice run","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Amongst the pupils at the house which was called Tanus, was a young Samuel Beckett who attended there between the age of five and nine.The school was located on the Leopardstown Road between Foxrock and Stillorgan and in his later years literally giant still recalled that the place had a big lawn where, between classes, he and his brother Frank would play with the other children.Also, whilst they were attending the school, the Beckett’s father acted as a surveyor for a new building that the Elsner’s had constructed at the end of their garden to act as a gymnasium.Having obviously inherited her father’s undoubted musical talent, Alex attended the Royal College of Music in London where she honed her contralto voice and on herto Ireland in  and took part in concerts with many of Dublin’s musical societies and remained an extremely popular choice for private recitals in the fashionable houses of the capital.Later in the s Alexandrina Elsner was travelling north to sing in Belfast and the North West as well. Amongst her first memorable appearances in Derry was a performance as a soloist at a St Columb’s Choral Union concert in February  and at another concert in October  at the city’s new Opera House on Carlisle Road.The stature of the appearance of Miss Elsner at Derry’s Opera House, which had opened in , should not be underestimated since there were very few venues of this stature in Ireland at the time that attracted only the top acts of the time. In fact, the Derry newspapers - the Standard, Derry Journal and Londonderry Sentinel lauded her as one of the most favoured performers of the local audiences.Renowned Italian opera companies regularly visited Derry to perform and such was the popularity of the city’s Opera House that late night train services for audiences were often laid on from Inishowen and in the city late evening tram services allowed audiences to travel more easily to the shows.When she married Abraham Stewart on June ,  Alex Elsner moved to Derry where she wasted no time in throwing herself into the cultural le of a city esteemed for not only for its love of music but its wealth of talent as well.Just two years after her arrival in her new home, Alexandrina had established the Londonderry Philharmonic Society and Londonderry Feis. The Feis, beginning as a single day event on April ,  eventually bloomed into a week-long festival of music and singing by the s and she herself took lead roles in the bi-annual performances of the Philharmonic Society.The budding impresario wisely took counsel from the organisers of the Feis Ceoilin her native city of Dublin and invited a representative to Derry to advise on how to establish a local version. As a result, Derry became the second place in Ireland to establish such a festival, beating Sligoand Belfastto the punch.Initially, there were just a few competitions – for church choirs, factory choirs, school choirs, drum and flute bands, brass bands and for solo singers as well as special medals for songs sung in Gaelic awarded by the Derry branch of the Gaelic League. The interest of budding competitors was immediately taken as the workers of the famed city shirt factories quickly scrambled to form choirs specically for the Feis.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn advance of the first year of competition, by February of  three of the factories established four choirs. Welch Margetson  Co and Hogg  Mitchell both entered a choir each, whilst the much larger workforce at Tillie  Henderson entered two choral groups.With the passing decades the Feis gained more and more competitors and its repertoire of competitions expanded as a result not just from all over Ireland but from Scotland and England as well. As its prestige also increased, many of Derry’s businesses were glad to be associated with its success and donated beautul gold and silver cups and medals. Bursary schemes for those intent in pursuing a professional le in music and singing also began.In , just a year after partition, another woman Mrs Edward HenryO’Doherty founded Feis Doire Colmcille along with Fr Joseph McGettigan. The Derry Feis centred more upon Irish music, dancing and singing but despite the obvious cultural dferences, competitors from the Catholic and Protestant communities competed in both feiseanna without exception.Alexandrina Stewarts devotion to the Londonderry Philharmonic Society was equal to her commitment to the feis. Apart from featuring her own distinguished performances, the concerts also featured many distinguished musical names from both London and Dublin.In an era long before manufactured television vehicles, the twice-yearly Derry concerts also attracted talent scouts from far and near seeking bookings for their concert halls and opera houses.And, a major talent was spotted as the result of the Philharmonic Society’s concert in Derry on March , . James Johnston, a native of Belfast was well-known as an amateur singer in his younger days but was practically untrained at the highest level. Instead he concentrated as a career in butchery in his father’s shop and supplemented his income as a semi-professional singer at venues around Ireland.It was after his performance in Derry that he was snapped up by the Dublin Grand Opera Society and so began a huge career as an opera singer. It was after highly memorable performances in Rigoletto in Ireland’s capital in , the globally renowned theatrical director Tyrone Guthrie offered him a contract at Sadler’s Wells where he became principal tenor for well in excess of a decade.During his career Johnston played a wide range of roles which included his Covent Garden debut in La Traviata in  and also appeared with Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. Johnston retired at the height of his fame in  and simply ed to working in the family butcher’s business in Belfast’s Sandy Row where he lived out the remainder of his le until he died aged  in .Johnston’s success however was entirely based on being spotted in Derry and to the efforts of Alex Stewart’s in establishing the city’s Philharmonic Society. It too sprang from relatively humble beginnings, with having just over  in the chorus and nineteen strong orchestra in . By the s the society accounted for  voices and a  strong orchestra that drew its membership from all classes across Derry.The pinnacle of Alex’s own musical career had perhaps come in March  when she was soloist for the celebrated Halle Orchestra at St Columb’s Hall. The orchestra had been founded in  in Manchester by Sir Charles Halle to perform at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in January . The orchestra exists to this day and has been in residence at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester since .Abraham Stewart died suddenly in  and as a result, Alexandrina ed home to her family in Dublin, but ed to Derry every year without fail during feis week. The Feis Committee awarded her the honorary title of administrator and offered to pay the fare for herjourney for le.On May ,  Alex McCausland Elsner Stewart died at a nursing home in Dublin and her remains were brought to Derry and buried beside those of her husband in the city cemetery. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Her daughter, also called Alexandrina, had been killed just a few weeks previously whilst on active service in Burma during World War II.Abraham and Alexandrina had lived at the prestigious Crawford Square in Derry and it was there on April ,  that the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque marking her le and contribution to the cultural le of her adopted city.Commenting on the unveiling of the blue plaque, Chris Spurr from the Ulster History Circle said: “When Alexandrina Stewart embraced Ireland’s city of music, the result was a harmonious partnership founding the first Londonderry Philharmonic Society and the Derry Feis Ceoil.”CAPTION: The Londonderry Philharmonic Society on stage at the Guildhall."},{"url":null,"title":"nerve visual gallery close doors ebrington","story":"The Nerve Visual Gallery at Ebrington is set to close at the beginning of next month, the Derry News has learned.The announcement will come as a great disappointment to art lovers in the city who have frequented the gallery over the past number of years and will be a loss to the Ebrington site.When it first opened in  it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.However, at the weekend a spokesperson for The Executive Officeconfirmed: “The Nerve Centre has operated a gallery in a section of the Creative Hub Building   on the Ebrington Site for three years and gave notice that they intend to close the gallery on  September .“The Executive Office is currently considering options for the section occupied by Nerve Gallery.”Located in the former army barracks at Ebrington, the Nerve Centre developed a series of major visual arts commissions with partners including - Now, National Museums NI, The Fondation Gilles Caron, Gallery of Photography Dublin, Ultra Lab Madrid and Matts Gallery London.Exhibitions have shone a light on pivotal moments in Northern Ireland’s history such as the Civil Rights movement and the Troubles.The Lost Moment exhibition looked anew at the Civil Rights movement fty years on from the marches and peaceful protests that immediately preceded the Troubles. It featured dramatic images of the famous Selma to Montgomery civil rights march in , alongside work on the Northern Irish civil rights struggle, from the first march in August  to the Battle of the Bogside in .Picturing Derry brought together some of the most iconic images from the Troubles and the most recent exhibition explored anxieties around Brexit which were part of a series of cross-border projects.Local artists were also regularly showcased at the gallery.Earlier this year plans to build a whiskey distillery in Ebrington fell through.But last week positive news emerged of plans to build two Grade A office blocks and a -apartment retirement village at the Waterside site.The Nerve Centre was contacted for comment regarding the gallery’s closure but did not respond at the

This will ensure that this important local landmark will be secure for generations to come and visitors to the town can continue to enjoy it as a back.The parishrsquos project convenor, Dennis Constable said: ldquoThis repair work will ensure that people will still be able to visit the church and enjoy looking at the heritage and the wonderful stained glass windows.ldquoThe church also holds many treasures of history that stretch back in Newcastlersquos history and which are relevant to many people.He added: ldquoThe repairs, which include the bell tower  will provide for the church bells, which have been silent for so long, to once again to be rung..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Border Cup set to start  ","story":"CUP action continues to dominate the local soccer scene with the countdown to Christmas joy beginning on Saturday.Thatrsquos when the first round of the prestigious Border Cup takes place with eight local teams in action.Top billing goes to the game at Robert Adams Park between Kilmore Rec and Portaferry.Other ties include Grove United v Killyleagh YC, Drumaness Mills v Greenisland, Holywood FC v Ballynahinch Olympic, Aquinas v Ballynahinch United, Comber Rec v Bangor Swts and Saintfield United v Bryansburn Rangers.

Work to widen Fountain Street to provide on-street parking and traffic calming measures has already been completed, while a pound, project at Collinsrsquo Corner is currently underway.Roads officials have previously suggested the introduction of a one-way system but little or nor progress appears to have been made on this particular scheme.While pleased with the work in Fountain Street and Collinsrsquo Corner, Cllr Curran believes they will not have a positive impact on town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with senior roads engineers. He is also concerned that no progress is being made to tackle a congestion and road safety issue at Edward Street in the town.His call for talks to discuss solutions to town centre congestion came ahead of a special meeting between councillors and roads officials last night when the Department of Infrastructure presented its annual report which details work that has already been completed on ious schemes and what projects are in the pipeline.Cllr Curran said the annual report contained no ldquoconcrete proposals for addressing town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with engineers.ldquoA proposed road between Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue has been shelved due to the cost involved and the minimal impact it would have on tackling congestion, he said. ldquoThat is why we need to get round the table and look at all options moving forward.ldquoCan lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking ldquoAll the key players need to get together as years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors.Cllr Curran says the time has come to ldquograsp the congestion nettle with the onus on roads officials to finally deliver by taking a critical look at the problems.ldquoWe need to take a critical look at the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward. I suspect that the congestion issue that we have in Downpatrick would not be allowed to go unaddressed in any other major town in the country. We have had numerous reports on the way forward but what people, in particular those in the business community what to see, is action, he continued.ldquoDownpatrick councillors need to join forces and sit down with roads engineers to look at what can be done. Apart from the development of the Saul Way link road, there has been no major traffic development in Downpatrick town centre for decades.ldquoThe congestion problem is getting worse andthe ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station base and adjoining buildings are to be a success and attract new commercial and private development, we need to solve the traffic problem.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe congestion is driving shoppers out of the town and we need to arrest this decline.

the town for a day in Newcastle which to some excited children at the time seemed like a million miles away when in reality it was literally only up the road.New shoes and clothes were purchased ahead of the annual excursion so everyone was looking their best, with families gathering at the St Dillonrsquos Avenue sports pitches before marching to the townrsquos bus station via Edward Street, John

sparked calls for action to be taken against teenagers terrorising the community in the Model Farm and Flying Horse areas.A number of cars were again pelted with stones as they drove along the Killough Road, while several fires were also started on Saturday evening.On Sunday, part of the Brannish Road was reported to be barricaded with branches and supermarket trolleys with young people targeting passing cars with stones.The most disturbing incident occurred on Monday evening when a woman driving alone was left frightened after her car was stoned on the Brannish Road as she made her way to work.Police have confirmed that they are aware of the recent trouble and warned those responsible for the unruly behaviour that their involvement could lead to a criminal record and harm their future university and employment prospects.Officers have also appealed to anyone who can assist them with their enquiries to contact them as they work to apprehend those responsible for the trouble.The Flying Horse Ward Community Forum mdash which earlier this year organised a public protest to call for an end to trouble at this part of the town mdash has condemned the weekend incidents.The grouprsquos chairwoman, Lisa Perry, said the continuing trouble was ldquosimply not acceptable and must end. She also appealed to parents to know where their children are and what they are doing.Ms Perry said children need to be taught to respect the community where they live, the people of the Model Farm and Flying Horse areas and those who commute along the Killough Road.ldquoResidents and those who use the Killough Road should not have to put up with such behaviour and anyone who knows who is responsible should contact the police, she said.Ms Perry said the message must go out that stoning cars is not acceptable and that those responsible will not be be allowed to get away with what they are doing.ldquoIt does not bear thinking about what would happena driver whose car is stoned loses control of the vehicle and crashes into pedestrians or someonersquos home. Those who throw missiles at cars need to realise the potential consequences of what they are doing. For drivers, this is a terribly frightening experience.Angry residents have also taken to social media to voice their concern about the trouble which has been prevalent at this part of Downpatrick for many years.Parents have also been urged to warn their children not to get involved in behaviour which could lead to serious consequences, with residents branding those responsible for the trouble as ldquodisgraceful. They said their parents should be doing more to stop the unruly behaviour, expressing concern that the trouble has been allowed to continue for too long and must be stopped.ldquoThe trouble is too frequent, said one woman, while a man revealed his van was stoned on two occasions at the Killough Road last month. Worryingly, he reported that children as young as  were responsible.Another resident expressed concern that a driver could lose control of their car after being stoned which could result in a crash and someone being seriously injured.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said local police must respond swtly to the anti-social behaviour, especially after Monday nightrsquos incident when a woman was attacked.ldquoThere has been an escalation of the anti-social behaviour in the Flying Horse and Model Farm area from a number of youths. Cars have been stoned, fires started and people assaulted. This behaviour is unacceptable, he declared.ldquoThe perceived inactivity of the authorities cannot be allowed to send a message that such behaviour is acceptable.

A video has been circulated on social media of part of the incident and praise has been heaped on Sean and Joshua for their brave actions.Joshua commented: “It happened so quickly, natural instincts took over.

The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”Lord Maginnis said that the settlement “was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens”.Sir Jonathan remains as the NIO’s permanent secretary, its most senior official.A month ago the News Letter revealed that all images of the Queen – even one of her shaking hands with Martin McGuinness – were then banned from the walls of Stormont House. NIO minister Lord Duncan said at the time that the department “takes steps to ensure no such images are displayed in Stormont House”.Reacting to widespread criticism of the move, new Secretary of State Julian Smith then tweeted a small image of the Queen on the mantel piece of his private office within the building, but the NIO declined to say whether it had only been placed there in response to criticism of the initial decision.Mr Smith ordered a civil service review of the initial decisions. Despite having begun at the height of the holiday season, that review has now been completed in an unusually brisk time frame for the slow-turning wheels of bureaucracy.The News Letter understands that a photo of the Queen on her own has been placed in the main entrance corridor of Stormont House - the first place where guests go when visiting the property - along with another image of the Queen with Irish President Michael D Higgins and an image of Prince Charles in a church with the Anglican and Roman Catholic Archbishops of Armagh.The images are part of a wider series of photos, one of which is of commemorations at the Ulster Tower for the fallen at the Somme. Officials believe the images as a whole represent a balanced range.A source close to Secretary of State Julian Smith said: “The Secretary of State was clear that the Head of State’s image should be on display in Stormont House.” pictured outside the High Court in Belfast where he was seeking an emergency injunction stopping Boris Johnson from suspending Parliament.

At the time of Lord Maginnis’s remarks, all that the NIO would say was: “We will not comment on inidual personnel matters.”The NIO said: “A portrait of the Queen – our head of state – is on display in the public area of Stormont House alongside a balanced set of images celebrating and reflecting the work of the Northern Ireland Office.”try catch  TrendingWoman whose body was found in NI town has

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m .

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
