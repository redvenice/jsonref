Almost every day in summer is 40C or above here.Usually, the rivers provide relief: swimming in cool water, fishing for golden perch or Murray cod or seeking the solace of a big sleepy red gum that lines the banks.But this year there are no rivers. With the mercury in the mid-40s, the Narran, the Namoi and the Barwon – all tributaries of the vast Murray-Darling river system – are dry, or reduced to a series of green, stagnant weir pools. The mighty red gums, roots exposed, are hanging on for dear life. Heritage-protected lakes and wetlands are empty, and with them have gone the breeding grounds of native birds and fish.Australia has endured a searing summer of drought and extreme heat. Hundreds of feral animals have died of thirst or faced culling as they encroached on properties in search of water. All-time temperature records have been broken in South Australia, with Adelaide reaching 46.6C, while Melbourne had its hottest day since the catastrophic 2009 bushfires, and more fires swept through Tasmania.The Murray-Darling basin, which stretches from Queensland, through New South Wales and Victoria before emptying into the Southern Ocean near Adelaide, should be the lifeblood of the continent in such times. But things have gone very wrong on the rivers.At Menindee, near Broken Hill, thousands of fish were found dead on 6 January, including giant Murray cod up to 40 years old.Government ministers blamed the drought that set in across eastern Australia from April 2017. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said the environmental disaster was down to the fact it “just hasn’t rained”.“We are experiencing a very, very dry period of unprecedented proportions,” he said. “And when it rains, it will come down in such torrents people will probably be saying ‘what are we going to do with all the water?’ That’s Australia.”But the huge fish kill drew the nation’s attention to the wider crisis on the Murray-Darling, which has been the subject of political wrangling between farmers, environmentalists and Indigenous groups for decades.While irrigation has expanded in some of Australia’s driest regions, the Darling and its tributaries have been reduced to a series of muddy pools. It’s not the first time the Darling has ceased to flow, but the unfolding severe ecological and social consequences have caused Australians to question whether its plan to save the Murray Darling basin from environmental disaster is working.“We have witnessed a catastrophic failure of Australia’s supposedly world-leading water management system,” Rene Woods, from the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations says.For decades the states along the river had been handing out water licences to farmers without any thought about what unbridled extraction for farming would mean for the river or downstream states.By the 1990s, the mouth of Murray at the end of the river system silted up. Salt levels became dangerously high, jeopardising Adelaide’s water supply, as well as internationally recognised wetlands.Governments were forced to act and in 2007, after years of difficult negotiations, the states and the commonwealth agreed to a plan that would licence water extraction and buy back a share of water for the environment.This water is owned by the Commonwealth and is released periodically to mimic nature and, in theory, keep the rivers healthy.But from the outset, the plan owed more to political compromise than science.“The best available science assembled for the guide to the the Basin Plan said that we needed 3,200GL to 7,600GL for the environment,” said Jamie Pittock, a professor at the Australian National University and a member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists.But ultimately only 2,750GL was allocated to the environment. Astoundingly, the plan also failed to take into account climate change, despite scientific reports showing that most of the basin will become hotter and drier.The Aboriginal nations of the basin have been all but ignored, too.“In the 1990s, when NSW water reform began, it was really difficult, because we had people say “what have Aboriginal people got to do with water?” They didn’t see that we had a valid place at the table,” Yuwalaraay man Ted Fields says.Native title rights do not include ownership of natural waters. They can include the use of water for personal, social, domestic and cultural purposes but an entitlement to extract water doesn’t mean there is any water to extract, or that the water is drinkable. Traditional owners are angry at being shut out of the water conversation.The loss is not just about day-to-day shortages. Gamilaraay and Yuwalaraay elders who have lived on the rivers all their lives say they have never seen conditions as bad as now, and they doubt it can ever be recovered.“This to me is the ultimate destruction of our culture,” Gamilaraay elder Virginia Robinson says in Walgett.“All people think about now is there’s no water. Aboriginal people were very close to nature and that’s all unbalanced now. There’s no nature to go back to.”Buying up water to return to the environment remains deeply unpopular in much of rural Australia because of its impact on farms, rural towns and jobs.At the same time the creation of a water market, where allocations can be traded, has benefited big agribusinesses who moved into industrial scale production of cotton and other high value crops, as well as water trading.The Greens and Indigenous groups have called for a royal commission amid allegations of corruption and poor governance. South Australia has already held its own royal commission into the plan, but was hampered by the federal government’s refusal to cooperate. It will report next week and is expected to warn that key aspects of the Murray-Darling plan are in breach of the Commonwealth Water Act.In Walgett the dry river means the town must live on bore water indefinitely. Bore water is high in mineral content, especially sodium. It kills gardens and discolours basins and bathtubs. It comes out of the tap very warm – there’s no need to turn on the hot tap to have a shower, but there is also no chance for a cool drink.Locals say bore water is not a long-term option as a drinking supply. Water restrictions mean no water can be used during daylight hours, and there are limits on washing, flushing of toilets and the use of evaporative air conditioners, even when with temperatures at extreme levels.The fish kill and the heat have at least brought the problems of water management squarely into the consciousness of city dwellers.The future of the Murray Darling basin is now a major issue in the upcoming federal and NSW elections.Yuwalaraay cultural educator Daryl Ferguson has a message for politicians and voters alike.“Everyone should take a leaf out of our culture – it is about looking after the land.“Everyone says “this is mine, this is my part of the river, this is mine, mine, mine.”“I’m not here to talk about ownership that’s not our culture. You want to own it? That’s fine.“Just look after it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e2d5b3a7065f9d3c9d8153e0359d27f177b11f8/595_741_5165_3099/master/5165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d30846693295acf26c6749d7c5ff9e0d","title":"chris mcqueer glasgow writer interview","story":"He quit his job selling trainers in Glasgow to become a writer. Now his contorted visions are earning him comparisons with Irvine Welsh. How does he feel about it all? ‘A bit poncy’Chris McQueer’s granny thinks he should get a real job. The 27-year-old Glaswegian, who quit his work punting trainers in a sportswear shop last year to concentrate on a writing career that has already prompted comparisons to Irvine Welsh, admits that he still feels shy describing himself as an author.“Even with taxi drivers, if they ask ‘Whit dae ye dae?’, I still tell them I work in the sports shop. I feel a bit poncy...” But McQueer has had to get used to talking about himself since he started self-publishing short stories on Twitter three years ago to see if he could make his pals laugh. His first collection, Hings, brought into book form by the independent Edinburgh publisher 404 Ink in 2017, won the Saboteur awards best short story collection the following year.Now a fixture on Glasgow’s spoken word circuit, McQueer’s second collection, HWFG (Here We Fucking Go) was similarly praised when it came out at the back end of last year and he is now working on his first novel. Actor Martin Compston describes him as “Charlie Brooker on Buckfast”.Sharing his stories online – “I’d just assumed it would be loads of people going, ‘This is shit’, but I got really nice feedback” – was a lightbulb moment, McQueer says. “This is it, this is what I want to do. It just felt natural to me to put it online rather than submitting stuff to literary magazines. I don’t read them, none of my pals read them, just put it online, then everybody can read it.”Building up his audience through another route has paid idends. “Schoolkids come and see me at spoken word gigs, and then when I had my book launch there were some women in their 60s from a book group. It was so cool all these different people all laughing at the same toilet humour.”And this may be something unique to McQueer: his affectionately, sometimes surgically, observed characters have an effervescence that the likes of Welsh or Brooker don’t always allow. His stories, which start off disarmingly ordinary then twist towards something altogether more surreal or horrifying, are as likely to end with a slap of humour than teeth-grinding nihilism.Like fellow Scots vernacularists Welsh and Limmy, McQueer writes as he talks and his stories are spiked with gallus (bold) words and phrases like glaikit (stupid), clatty (dirty) and bumping yer gums (chatting) that may require some translation for those beyond a Glasgow postcode.But for McQueer, writing in Scots is about accessibility. “When I started writing it just felt natural to write how I talk. The only writing I’d came across that was in Glaswegian Scots, like my family spoke, was Tom Leonard’s poetry. I think that’s part of the reason that my books have been picked up by a lot of people. I get a lot of messages on Twitter saying, ‘This is the first book I’ve read since school.’ And I think that’s because of how I’ve written it, so it feels like it’s for people like us.“I’ve always felt like Scots is our language,” he goes on, “because we’ve got so many unique words and phrases. Even when I was in primary school if the teacher asked me something and I said aye and naw, they’d correct me and say it’s yes and no. Why though? That’s how you talk when you’re no in the school, so why are we all in this big charade, why are you trying to make me talk like a newsreader? It grates on me!”McQueer was brought up and still lives in Glasgow’s east end, an area more often highlighted for its poverty. “The east end is the perfect place for a writer to live,” he insists. “Growing up with so many characters living round about: if I’m struggling for ideas, I can just think of some mad thing that happened in my childhood.”The sports shop was another mine of material, he explains. “All day, every day, I’m interacting with people, picking up on their wee quirks and getting stories out of them. I do miss that now. I feel I’m not exposed to as many people any more.” He muses: “Maybe I need to go back part-time.”• HWFG by Chris McQueer is published by 404 Ink."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ac153ab03ef0544e88b9583ba113027ebd9e3c9/0_195_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6313505bfa5cd823e9844ee304181782","title":"john wray interview godsendamerican woman taliban","story":"A tale he heard in Afghanistan about an American teenager who disguised herself as a boy to fight with the Taliban inspired the novel GodsendIt takes a certain audacity for a white male novelist to choose as his protagonist a young California woman who converts to Islam, disguises herself as a man in order to study in the tribal borderlands of Pakistan, and from there joins the Taliban in Afghanistan. You almost wonder if he’s spoiling for a fight of some kind. But the author of Godsend, John Wray (6ft 3in, softly spoken and unassuming), doesn’t seem the type. The most aggressive thing about him is the ghostly wailing of the doorbell of his brownstone near Prospect Park in Brooklyn (it’s on a “Halloween setting”). A Guggenheim and Whiting award winner, best known for Lowboy and The Lost Time Accidents, Wray was anointed one of Granta’s Best Young American Novelists in 2007. He has been living mostly in Mexico City for the past couple of years, but I caught him while he was in town to see his mother for the holidays.The house, which he bought and fixed up several years ago when it “looked like there had been a fire”, has become a renowned haven for writers and artists, all gleaming wood and a David Bowie tribute bathroom. Friends are always in and out, often staying longer than expected, especially now that Wray is, in his late 40s, “at the age where people are getting orced”. Current and former residents or renters of workspace there include Marlon James, Nathan Englander, Alice Sola Kim and Adrian Tomine.As I talk to Wray, the novelist Akhil Sharma, who came to crash for a week or two, “and that was two years ago”, saunters upstairs, wearing Wray’s scarf. Wray asks if I want the football table that sits in the middle of the living room “like an enormous vase of flowers that cannot be moved” – an unsolicited gift from the Chilean writer Alejandro Zambra, who apparently decided the house was missing a touch of machismo. “People only play if they’re drunk,” he says. Noting affectionately that the crowd he has assembled here are “not just artists, they’re actually doing stuff that’s good”, he catches himself and laughs: “That’s a terrible thing to say.”Still, it’s true that you can get away with a lot more if you’re good. Late on in the writing of Godsend, when Wray was starting to worry about publishing such a book “at this moment in US culture where there’s a lot of attention being brought to bear, for very good reasons, on who’s telling the story, what their agenda is, who should have the right to tell a given story”, he asked Hari Kunzru for advice.“And he said: ‘You know, the real problem is not John Updike and Martin Amis, as privileged white men, writing about Islam. The problem was the books weren’t good.’ So, he just said: ‘Make it good. That’s the way to deal with that problem.’”Wray agrees: Updike’s Terrorist seems “as though his mind was made up at the beginning … He thought he had all the answers. That’s usually a mistake. Even if you’re writing a novel about a orce, it’s probably a good idea not to feel like you have all the answers going into it.”With a delicate subject like this one, if you’re not pulling it off, Wray says, “you have to hope that someone close to you in your life will take you aside and say: ‘Listen, buddy, you’re really barking up the wrong tree here.’”No one did, and the novel is a thrilling high-wire act – the experiences of its heroine, Aden Sawyer, renamed Suleyman, feel very real. Nonetheless, Wray was sensitive to the risk that he might inadvertently “contribute to the literature of misperception with regard to the Islamic world, with regard to aggressive views of the United States internationally, with regard to militant insurgencies, all the things that have been so cynically misrepresented in popular culture. I’m sure there are plenty of people who worked on Homeland who had the best intentions, who think of themselves as political progressives. And yet what they ended up producing was so self-serving and so Islamophobic and so juvenile in its treatment of a very complicated and nuanced issue.”Godsend was sparked by an “arresting and fascinating fragment of a story” about a young female American Taliban fighter Wray heard in Afghanistan, during the weeks he spent doing research for a non-fiction project about John Walker Lindh, the US citizen captured while serving with the Taliban in 2001. When Lindh’s story hit the headlines, Wray recalls, “many Americans were like: ‘How is this even conceivable?’ And to me it seems perfectly understandable, why a young man would be drawn to the romance of this particular type of activism, which then took on a military element.”Wray didn’t “feel confused or perturbed or perplexed or sort of conceptually out of my depth in any way” when thinking about Lindh’s story. “If you think about it, what could be more appealing to a teenager who’s grown up in comfortable upper-middle class circumstances, whose parents are separating, who’s suddenly at that age at which the entire adult world seems like really just a swamp of hypocrisy?” Whereas the American girl he kept hearing about in Aghanistan, whether or not she really existed – Wray suspects not – struck him as a more intriguingly mysterious prospect to write about, her motivation perhaps “a harder question to answer”.In a sense, though, he feels he did answer it: “I definitely don’t judge people who become passionately involved in a political struggle, even to the point of taking up weapons in the service of that struggle, in the way that I would have before beginning the book.”For him the interest was primarily psychological. “I’m sure there are very gifted writers who can begin with an idea – ‘I’m going to investigate capitalism, or I’m going to write a book that really confronts sexism in some way, so what would be a good situation for that?’” For Wray, though, “as soon as you have a point you’re trying to prove, you’re writing polemic.”There are only a couple of moments in Godsend where Wray “came close to expressing a slightly more naked kind of political view, which I really tried not to do at all if I could avoid it – but of course, if you’re writing about a drone strike, you can’t avoid it.” He did feel that there would be some “possible value” in writing “a really vivid account of a drone strike from the point of view of the people who are being hit”, when so many accounts of the ethics of drone warfare are “from the point of view of the people who are sitting at the controls … It is kind of funny I’ve read a number of articles about the psychological toll that being a drone operator takes on the men in those little bunkers in Arizona, and that’s fine. But perhaps the toll is slightly greater on the people who are on the receiving end.”He remarks that American critics frequently noted the novel’s very brief, glancing treatment of the September 11 attacks – the only way he could think of to deal with that subject and “avoid cliche would be to talk about it almost as a kind of distant and borderline irrelevant rumour.”Wray got a lot of use out of TE Lawrence’s Seven Pillars of Wisdom and was surprised that readers “brought up Yentl all the time, but they never brought up Lawrence of Arabia”. Nor did they mention Joan of Arc, one of the key figures he thought about when writing the book. He looked at other real-life examples, including two women who disguised themselves to fight in the American civil war, and is also interested in how often “that kind of legend seems to have popped up in various cultures”.Despite the almost mythic element of Aden’s story, Wray needed it to have “an air of reality and authority” – “in fiction, unlikely is OK but implausible is not OK.” He took it as a challenge “not to present anyone in it as exotic, or the situation as exotic, not to exoticise anything”. His fixer on that first trip to Afghanistan unintentionally gave him an experience that proved useful later by dressing him in a kameez and skull cap to make him less conspicuous (hunching over to conceal his height also helped).His experiences researching Godsend were the most alarming he’s had, although preparing for Lowboy, his acclaimed 2009 thriller tracing a day in the life of a teenager with paranoid schizophrenia, comes a close second. Lowboy’s protagonist, Will, who rides the New York subway on a quest for the girl who can take his virginity and thus help slow global warming, has stopped taking his medication and escaped the clinic where he was being held. For Wray, going into psychiatric hospitals and being “introduced to people as a med student” was “in a different way as stressful” as Afghanistan: he worried that maybe he “shouldn’t even be there”. He also wrote much of Lowboy while actually travelling on the New York subway, believing in the need “to make a project fun for yourself. I don’t particularly like working. So you try to turn it into a little adventure.” It may have yielded some extra insights here and there, but mainly allowed him “to not be in my house”.When he does write in the Brooklyn house, it’s in the basement, which is full of musical instruments (as well as a ping-pong table), like “a throw-back” to the rehearsal space he lived in for a while in his mid-20s – “minus the rats”. Since giving up smoking, instead of cigarette breaks, “I’ll just nervously play the drums for a few minutes, and it works quite well as a substitute ’cos it’s that same kind of anxious energy. Much more expressive, much less carcinogenic.” Years ago, Wray “was in a bunch of mediocre bands” and also played now and then with Chan Marshall (AKA Cat Power), though he says writing was “the thing that I maybe felt I had a more realistic chance of doing well”.His next project should be “less terrifying, more fun, I suppose”: it’s about three young people growing up in South Florida’s death metal scene. Wray wasn’t a metalhead, growing up in Buffalo, New York, “a rustbelt town” that was then “a pretty depressed place, and a pretty violent place”. Iron Maiden was “the dominant paradigm”, but he preferred the Smiths. He “had a bad time” at that age. “When I think about all the times that I drove when I was drunk when I was a teenager, just terrible, idiotic things that a fully developed brain would not have been on board with – there’s just this enormous pool of insufficiently risk-averse human beings, and that’s why we have standing armies, you know, that’s why we always find people willing to parachute into the jungle in Vietnam and set a village on fire.” Half-joking, he adds,“I’m scared of teenagers. It’s a very beautiful, very pure and very dangerous age, you know, it’s a fucked up age in many ways.” You get the sense that Wray could conjure pretty much any mind he wanted on the page – all the more intriguing, then, that Aden Sawyer’s turned out not to be quite the crazy leap it seemed.• Godsend is published by Canongate.

What are your favourites? In a week that feels ripe for celebrating the reach of poetry – and just in time for Burns Night – the Scottish Poetry Library has asked James Naughtie to choose his “best of the best” Scottish poems of the past 15 years.Moving from, as Naughtie puts it, “Edwin Morgan in his last years talking about love” to “Kathleen Jamie catching a sense of national belonging in a few short lines”, it is a soul-quenching selection. There is humour and beauty in Claire Askew’s I Am the Moon, and You Are the Man on Me: “Tonight, I am white and full.  My surface is all curves  and craters,” she opens, later writing, deliciously: “Your compass does not work here,  but you are sexy  in your spaceman suit.” Liz Lochhead’s In the Mid-Midwinter, written after John Donne’s A Nocturnal on St Lucy’s Day, feels ever so apt for these bleak days of January: “There’s nothing very much to speak of anything to speak of  in the sky except a gey dreich greyness  rain-laden over Glasgow,” she writes. But “the light comes back  the light always comes back.” Lochhead’s description of the winter moon, “fat in the frosty sky among the sharpest stars”, is irresistible.According to Colin Waters from the Scottish Poetry Library, which has published all the poems on its site, the poems are “part of the long and colourful history of Scottish poetry that Burns embodied through his life and work”. But the collection also shows how poetry has moved on.“Someone asked me last week whether Burns wasn’t a little ‘problematic’,” Waters says, “particularly his attitude to women and sex. We’re not blind to that, and with the collection including strong contributions by, among others, Liz Lochhead, JL Williams, Katie Ailes and Jen Hadfield, we can see that contemporary Scottish poetry is at least trying to expand the voices it showcases.”As Naughtie puts it: “We’re stepping into rich pasture here.” But the broadcaster was only considering the last 15 years of Scottish poetry. As it is indeed Burns Night, let’s see what else we might include if we were allowed to consider the full wealth of Scotland’s rich poetic heritage, whether the poetry of Burns himself – Tam o’ Shanter was voted the nation’s favourite in 2012 – or the glory of Violet Jacob’s The Wild Geese, or my own personal favourite Morgan poem, Strawberries. I’ve no agenda other than reading wonderful poetry from the land of “westlin’ winds and fernie braes,  Northern lights and siller tides,”, as Kathleen Jamie writes in Here Lies Our Land, and I hope you’ll join me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ead1d6402c2c9a2f09172b58fdcb7e44dce780a/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2310d79c97a4ee229f98f394324b22bd","title":"did you work for a uk high street chain that has closed","story":"For an upcoming project, we would like to hear from former workers of chain shops that shut about how it affected their livesWith thousands of high street shops closing over the last decade, communities have been rightly concerned about the decline and what the future holds.If you worked for a high street chain that shut down, we’d like to hear from you.

It is in fact a con, a myth, a great deception. Take the latest striking example: according to the National Audit Office, British taxpayers are expected to cough up £24bn for tax relief given to oil and gas corporations, for the removal of North Sea wells, rigs and pipelines. Better start saving up, because if the companies suddenly go under, that bill will only increase. Indeed, some companies have already defaulted on the costs of decommissioning, leaving you and I to pay millions of pounds.Many questions arise here. While Britain’s Tory government frittered away its North Sea oil wealth, Norway invested the proceeds into a sovereign wealth fund which is now worth $1tn. We could have saved up the wealth to invest in the country’s future – what a tragic waste. It is also a damning indictment that we are splashing out on tax breaks for big oil rather than properly investing in tackling the existential crisis of climate change, and in doing so, creating vast numbers of jobs in renewable energy as Germany has done.But it is yet another example of socialism for the rich, capitalism for everyone else. Britain’s private sector is utterly dependent on state largesse to make money. They depend on the state to invest in infrastructure in research and development in education to train up their workforce in law and order to protect their property – and yet many big companies fail to contribute in exchange thanks to mass tax avoidance.Because so many employers refuse to pay their workers a wage on which they can live – most Britons languishing below the poverty line are in work – the state has to spend billions of pounds a year on in-work benefits. Private landlords charging rip-off rents are subsidised by about £9bn a year by the state. The backbone of 21st-century British capitalism – finance – was famously bailed out by the state after it plunged the economy into turmoil, and banks benefit from numerous other subsidies, too: such as their implicit “too big to fail” subsidy worth billions, and the state insurance of all bank deposits.Rail companies receive more subsidies than they did when the industry was publicly owned. According to the National Audit Office in 2016, the Treasury spends about £225bn – or about £3 in every £10 of government money – on private or voluntary providers. The list goes on.Modern capitalism is based on a myth: that thriving private entrepreneurs generate wealth through their own hard work, innovation and get-up-and-go. In fact, the state subsidises the entire system, nationalising the risks but privatising the profits, while allowing its beneficiaries – our shameless, profit-obsessed elite – power without accountability. It exposes how rotten our entire social order is – and why it has to go."},{"url":null,"title":"social media influencers clear ads celebrities authorities","story":"Izzy just wants to tell the world about her skincare regime. The blond teenager has suffered with acne for years – at school, one bully cruelly nicknamed her Dimple Pimple. She has tried so many face washes – she even had prescription meds. It’s no wonder her story, told in a series of tweets earlier this month, resonated with hundreds of people, and was “liked” on the site more than 1,000 times.Thankfully, there is a happy ending. One “random Tuesday about six months ago”, Izzy found a cure for her troublesome skin. Coffee Creations coffee scrub!This Twitter thread – which looks like it was sent by an earnest young woman – is an advert posted by a corporation in a process known as “astroturfing” (like the artificial turf, it might look authentic, but it’s not the real thing). Izzy’s thread – and the countless others “she” has posted like it – sum up just how complicated online advertising is today. That’s why, although I’m happy that dozens of celebrities have promised the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to be clearer about the way they advertise online, I wonder if it’s too little, too late.Sixteen influencers – including models, reality TV stars, and actors – have vowed to the CMA that they will be clear in their online posts about whether they have been paid (in money or gifts) to promote a product. This comes five years after the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) first introduced #ad, a way for internet celebrities to clearly mark paid-for posts.Social media celebs earn thousands of pounds by posting adverts for brands, and this new commitment to transparency is commendable. Young, impressionable audiences deserve to know whether someone they admire is truly recommending a product or being paid to do so. Under the CMA’s remit, influencers who break the rules can be fined and even jailed for up to two years.And yet, is anyone really deterred? In September 2017, the ASA upheld a complaint against Geordie Shore star Sophie Kasaei for posting a picture of the diet drink Flat Tummy Tea on Instagram, alongside unverified claims that the drink aided weight loss. This was arguably a win for regulators, but Kasaei was undeterred. On 2 January 2018, she told her 1.9 million Instagram followers about her new range of diet supplements, SZKNutrition. Earlier this month, she posted about the supplements again – without #ad or a mention of her recent trip to an exclusive exercise bootcamp in Marrakech.Ultimately, the public continues to be misled – and things quickly get even more complicated. In December 2017, a 22-year-old American named Jake tweeted a picture of Extra chewing gum alongside a story about his blossoming romance with a classmate. The tweet looked like an ad – the brand was prominent, and Jake even used Extra’s official social media slogan #GiveExtraGetExtra. Yet when I contacted Extra, they were emphatic that this was not a paid promotion.Why would a young person create a social media post that looks like an ad, even when they’re not being paid? Recently the Atlantic’s Taylor Lorenz revealed that hundreds of wannabe-influencers are faking brand deals by posting advertisements that seem paid for, using #ad, so that they look more famous than they are. Good luck, CMA!Two recent documentary films about the ill-fated Fyre festival have been getting lots of attention – but no influencer who was paid to advertise the disastrous event (which saw attendees at the music festival stranded in the Bahamas with limited food and water) has been punished or faced opprobrium. Kendall Jenner reportedly received $250,000 to advertise Fyre, and did so without using #ad. She hasn’t been fined, or even spoken publicly about the deal.The CMA is making progress, and celebrities who are truly committed to change are commendable, but there are far too many shady influencers who continue to blur the lines – and get away with it.My personal favourite comes from Jenner’s sister, Khloé Kardashian. On 12 June 2017, the reality star posted a candid caption about her love of a sugary hair supplement. “This is more than just an #Ad because I truly love these delicious, soft, chewy vitamins,” she wrote on Instagram. And they say the Kardashians aren’t clever!There are countless other examples: one famous British YouTuber has been known to place the word “ad” on the bottom right hand corner of his YouTube thumbnails, conveniently behind YouTube’s timestamps – while his girlfriend posts affiliated links to the products she uses in her videos without revealing that she’s paid every time they’re clicked. It prompts the question – is this industry even possible to regulate?Influencers will tell you where the dress they’re wearing is from and the name of the lipstick they used – are they being helpful or are they advertising? I’ve written about this phenomenon for five years, and I can’t tell. How on earth could a pre-teen? How on earth can the CMA?• Amelia Tait is a journalist who writes about tech and internet phenomena"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f86ea77ef607f5655add1e7e4fe951015732e89a/0_0_7977_5318/master/7977.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b7d3307bcbb4d06963b2c7c9cf81ec86","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

But from Sylvester Stallone to Kevin Costner, he’s not the only actor-director guilty of self-worshipThe hero of The Mule is Earl Stone, a horticulturist who earns extra cash ferrying drugs across the US. He is a popular fellow, and there are no fewer than three scenes in the film in which he is applauded by large and admiring crowds. Though aged 90, he has two separate threesomes in the course of the film, both with women in their 20s who are eager to get their hands on him. (“It’s my turn!” says one impatiently). Earl may crack a joke about Viagra in the film’s opening minutes, but he requires no chemical boost. And it is not enough that he should get it on with two women at once he is also spied on from across the street by a younger man, mystified and perhaps a touch envious about the old timer’s allure.It is encouraging to find a stereotype-busting role like this on the screen, and good to see that Clint Eastwood has the vim to play it. But that joy can only be compromised by the knowledge that Eastwood also cast the part, and called the shots behind the camera. All those closeups of himself looking incorrigible, or lapping up the adoration of others, or getting down to business with women young enough to be his great-granddaughters – these were staged and approved by him. Perhaps he even asked for extra takes. Better safe than sorry.Eastwood is no slouch when it comes to self-worship, though in his case it usually has a moral rather than a sexual dimension in films such as Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino, he performs self-sacrificial acts for the betterment of mankind, or to atone for his own sins. At least when he made his directorial debut in 1971 with Play Misty for Me, he was to some extent interrogating male narcissism as much as he was wallowing in it. In that thriller about a gadabout DJ who is stalked by a female fan, there is the sense that Eastwood’s character is the architect of his own undoing, paying the price for his cavalier treatment of women. Fast forward nearly half a century and analysis has been replaced by analgesia.Whenever an actor directs his own performance (and it is almost invariably a “he”), there is the risk that a film will morph into a vanity project. There can have been little reason for the Scrubs star Zach Braff to have directed himself in Garden State and Wish I Was Here other than to promote Brand Braff: quirky, sensitive, indie-loving. Overstretching is another risk, as Kenneth Branagh proved when he directed himself in six films over the course of just seven years, some of them so bad that their titles (Dead Again, Peter’s Friends) are never mentioned on film sets for fear they will summon a Macbeth-style curse.But vanity need not make an endeavour worthless. When Bradley Cooper, who plays an FBI agent in The Mule, directed himself last year as a fading country-rock singer in A Star Is Born, he gave us vain without the pain. As one of the co-writers of this remake, Cooper had the opportunity to shift the balance of the story away from its usual focus on male self-destruction and to give the female lead a bigger slice of the pie. It was one he chose to resist. With Cooper in charge behind the camera, as well as hogging the meaty scenes in front of it, this was vanity cinema at its baldest. Fortunately it’s no hardship watching him: file Cooper in the vain-but-worth-it category alongside Warren Beatty directing his own performances in Heaven Can Wait and Reds.At least Cooper wasn’t deluded. When Kevin Spacey first proposed making Beyond the Sea, a film about the singer Bobby Darin, he was 32 – five years younger than Darin was when he died, and comfortably within range of playing the part. By the time Spacey found financing for the project, he was 45. A wise man would have known that the years had overtaken him, and that he should probably find someone else to tackle the crooner’s late teens and 20s, but Spacey was not that man. Beyond the Sea tries to pre-empt such criticisms by having the older Darin debate the story’s veracity with his childhood self, but this technique comes across as precisely what it is: the equivalent of slapping a sticking-plaster on a compound fracture.Plenty of actor-directors make the mistake of assuming themselves to be positively adorable. Sylvester Stallone directed parts two, three, four and six of his own Rocky series, amplifying his sentimental fondness for the title character each time. Even the one film that he directed that didn’t have a role for him – his pitiful Saturday Night Fever sequel Staying Alive – still included a tell-tale flash of egotism. Stallone gives himself a Hitchcock-style walk-on part in the movie, which might have been harmless enough had he not directed its star, John Travolta, to perform a disbelieving double-take as he strolled past.There are numerous ways in which an actor-director can share with the world his high opinion of himself but you have to admire the directness of Vincent Gallo. It was ironic that the actor-writer-director was mocked for his film The Brown Bunny, and for the moment in which he is fellated on-screen by Chloë Sevigny, when anyone who has watched the whole movie will know that this scene has a nasty sting in the tail: the encounter transpires to be pure fantasy, the product of Gallo’s character’s warped guilt over failing to save Sevigny from an ugly death. Far more deserving of ridicule is the scene in his directorial debut Buffalo 66, in which he is shown peeing at a urinal while the man next to him marvels at Gallo’s equipment. “It’s so big!” the man says, as though it would have been impolite to keep this view to himself. Difficult to look at this scene, written and directed by its star, without thinking: What a dick.There is no shortage of contenders for the title of most self-regarding actor-director in cinema: George Clooney in Leatherheads, Jean-Claude Van Damme in The Quest, Steven Seagal in On Deadly Ground, Prince in Under the Cherry Moon. But it takes a special kind of vanity to combine narcissism and prestige and it is for that reason that no one can hold a candle to Kevin Costner, even 29 years after his performance in his own Dances With Wolves as a Union soldier who discovers a kinship with the Sioux. There may ostensibly be an on-screen love story between the hero and a Sioux woman (Mary McDonnell), but the most convincing romance is the one between director and star, Costner and Costner.There is nothing quite like it. Except, perhaps, Costner’s followup, The Postman, which repeated all the same tricks as Dances With Wolves to zero acclaim. In this futuristic drama, set at a time when democracy has collapsed in America and the land is ruled by thugs, Costner chances upon an old mail van and reinstates the country’s postal service. The actor does his humble messiah routine from Dances With Wolves, while several hundred extras send looks of awestruck wonder in his direction. The effect suggests a man contemplating himself in a mirror for three hours.If one element is conspicuous by its absence from this survey, it is women. It is not unheard of for a female director to show excessive self-regard or false humility, and it would be hard to think of a better example than The Mirror Has Two Faces, a take on the Ugly Duckling story directed by its star, Barbra Streisand. The picture contains endless scenes of Streisand fishing for the audience’s compliments, playing gawky when we can see all along that she’s glam it is the stuff of Marie Antoinette at the milking stool. Yet to put it in the same class as Costner’s work would be to praise it with faint damning. Streisand can be self-indulgent, but she is no Costner. Only once a female film-maker directs herself in something as self-admiringly bad as The Postman will we have achieved true equality between the genders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93414e218a749b0d0edd7c64630e3c86214735fd/0_597_1324_794/master/1324.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0667a5e219ec7366c62fb335c6e08c7","title":"the dude big lebowski","story":"The Big Lebowski’s slacker supremo is set for a shock return. Is he the hero this era needs, or has the ultimate maverick been hired to hawk us a soft drink?Sometimes there’s a man. I won’t say a hero – ’cause what’s a hero? – but sometimes there’s a man – and I’m talking about the Dude here – sometimes there’s a man who, well, he’s the man for his time and place. And over the last day or so, the Dude – AKA Jeffrey Lebowski, the iconic stoner-deadbeat-turned-understated-hero played by Jeff Bridges in the Coen brothers’ 1998 classic The Big Lebowski – well, his time and place has been on Twitter, a realm even weirder than his home turf of 90s Los Angeles.On Thursday, Bridges posted a 15-second video on Twitter, since watched more than 7m times and pored over in great detail, teasing the return of the Dude.Those familiar jelly sandals walk in on a floorful of party detritus, with smashed wine glasses, salad plates and asparagus spears suggesting somewhat classier surrounds than the Dude’s typical hangouts. The camera pans up to reveal the character’s timeless knitwear and hair. He turns toward us, all goatee and shades, gives a perfectly low-key smile and nod, and goes on his way. As in the original movie, tumbleweed drifts down the urban pavement and Bob Dylan sings The Man in Me.For Lebowski fans – or Achievers, to give us our proper title – merely seeing that the Dude abides is enough to warm the heart. It’s good knowing he’s still out there, takin’ her easy for all us sinners, and Bridges still absolutely looks the part. But a couple more things come to mind, too. The date given at the end of the video is Sunday 3 February: the day of the Superbowl, which is as famous for gimmicky high-profile commercials as it is for touchdowns. Has the Dude sold out to the Man? And, if so, why does the Man even think he’s worth buying?The bad news is that Bridges’s video looks like an ad for an ad rather than a new Lebowski movie. Bridges has said he’d be happy to revisit the role – and John Turturro has reportedly spun his character, Jesus, off into a whole new movie – but the Coens have ruled out a Lebowski sequel. We’re likely looking at a commercial, then – though given that the Coens have made Superbowl ads in the past, there’s still a chance they’re involved.Judgment should be reserved until the date rolls around but, given the Dude’s avowedly underground sensibility, the idea of him shilling for some corporate product can’t help deflate the excitement of seeing him at large once more. Well, he might shrug, you gotta feed the monkey.Yet it’s interesting to ask why the character is still deemed resonant enough to exploit. Why, more than two decades on, does the Dude still strike a chord?Call me a sap but I’d like to think it’s because he represents qualities that can seem hard to come by these days – relics of a different era, even. He’s a live-and-let-live kind of guy, a devotee of peace and love with beliefs about mutual care that are deeply held but lightly worn. He’s slow to anger or insult, abhors aggression and conflict, and happily drinks and bowls with a best bud, Walter (John Goodman), whose politics and life experience are the polar opposite of his own. At a time when ision, accusation and contempt seem to be all around, the Dude offers an offbeat model of love. Here’s hoping that, on 3 February, Walter will be back to share in it too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fe337ebf4b36220ee2eb5d67c14d4c3eb70d341/0_1300_4444_2667/master/4444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77d95e7cf9b6fdc88347eb4b1c5ef10b","title":"cocktail of the week bittersweet ginseng recipe bo bech","story":"Once you’ve acquired a taste for it, there’s no going back30ml Kamm \u0026amp Sons (see introduction)20ml red vermouth – I use Punt e Mes10ml orange curaçao liqueur – I use Giffard’s5ml CampariKamm \u0026amp Sons is a British spirit that features more than 40 botanicals, the main ones being ginseng and grapefruit peel.

You don’t get many more expert in bread-making than Richard Bertinet, a Bath-based baker and food writer from Brittany, so let’s ask him.“The first thing that springs to mind,” Bertinet says, “is that your dough is probably too cold.” Or, put another way, the water you’re using isn’t warm enough. “It’s vital you give the yeast a helping hand, otherwise it’ll just slumber lazily,” he says, adding that your water floursaltyeast ratio is also crucial. “A lot of people are wary of adding too much water, and end up using too little.”So how can you tell if your water is the wrong temperature? Easy, says Bertinet, whose sixth book, Crumb, is out in February (Octopus, £25) and covers all things bread. “Just stick a finger into it – if you can’t feel any change in temperature, the water is about right, but if it’s any cooler than blood temperature, you’re asking too much of your yeast.”Also, keep the salt and yeast well apart until you bring them together in the dough, otherwise, as Paul Hollywood warns, the former may kill the latter.Of course, there may be other factors involved. For instance, Bertinet wonders if maybe you’re proving the dough in the wrong environment. Yeast needs not just warmth, but also a bit of humidity to do its thing, “so never prove dough in an airing cupboard – it’s way too dry”. To help things along, put the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with plastic (Bertinet uses polythene bags) and leave somewhere warm in the kitchen.Finally, invest in the right yeast. If your dough isn’t rising, it might be tempting to use one of the strong, mass-market, fast-acting dried yeasts. Don’t, says Bertinet. “They’ve got all sorts of chemicals in them, and are far too strong.” He can see why the stuff is so popular, but convenience isn’t everything. And if you really have no option, ignore what it says on the packet and use sparingly. “One teaspoon for every kilo of flour is about right,” Bertinet says, “but no more.”He recommends using fresh yeast, if possible, which isn’t as hard to get hold of as you might think. “It’s sold in all good delis,” Bertinet says. “And, if you ask nicely, your local supermarket or high-street bakery might even give you some for free.” Especially if you buy a job lot of doughnuts or pasties first.• Do you have a culinary dilemma that needs solving?

He knows his club need to guarantee juicy Premier League TV cash if the club are ever to sign another player again.It’s so important. With all the money involved in the Premier League, everyone knows that if you want to grow, if you want to be better, you have to guarantee this money for the next year. To stay in the Premier League is really, really important, but at this stage, if we can go through, we will try to do it. We’re playing at home. Will it be the strongest team in terms of match-fitness? Maybe not. Will it be a team, in my opinion, that can go through or can win the game? Yes, I think so.Pep Guardiola turned up for his press conference sounding a little out of breath. Are there stairs to climb at City’s training ground? He’s asked about whether City can scoop four trophies this season. He’s having none of it. Whenever I see the word fantasy, Baby D kicks off in my head like it’s 1994 again. Roy Hodgson was a bit prickly when asked about potential interest from the Bundesliga leaders in Wilfried Zaha. There has been absolutely no dialogue whatsoever between Borussia Dortmund and Crystal Palace Football Club. If I am going to comment every time a club is linked with Wilf Zaha, I will be talking about it for a long time. Wilf signed a long-term contract with Crystal Palace. He’s very much our player. I’d be very surprised if there were any clubs out there who wouldn’t think he’s very good, but that doesn’t mean to say they are going to try and buy him.You can read more from Roy in this here transfer roundup, which confirms that Bakary Sako is back at Palace, where he is touching his toes and coughing for the doctor before joining on a short-term deal from West Brom: Afternoon readers. Thanks to Nick for getting the weekend started. Some bad news for South Korea fans now in the form of good news for Spurs fans. Qatar have beaten South Korea 1-0 and knocked them out of the Asian Cup! That’s quite the shock, all right, but it does mean that Son Heung-min should be back in London and scampering around for Spurs sooner rather than later. I’m going to take my leave now. It’s been a pleasure. And it’s about to get even pleasurable for you people now that Gregg Bakowski is here to steer you home for the next couple of hours.Leandro Paredes was linked with Chelsea earlier in the transfer window, but he’s now joined Paris Saint-Germain. Crushing BLOW for the Stamford Bridge side as they MISS OUT on LEADING TARGET. Here’s a story about the deal he actually has signed:That’s it – Qatar are in the Asian Cup semi-finals and will face Australia or UAE! Son Heung-min is coming back to London, in great news for Tottenham and false-nine fans.Qatar lead South Korea! Spurs might get their wish, and the World Cup 2022 hosts might edge to within a game of a huge final for them – Abdulaziz Hatem has scored 12 minutes from time to make it 1-0!Transfer news! Victor Moses to Fenerbahce!It’s a hefty 18-month loan deal. Moses has been a curious case – the right man at the right time for Antonio Conte, but in the wilderness before and since.The only sure thing here is that the situation is just awful for all it affects.It was quite a time for the returning oldie shot-stoppers last weekend, wasn’t it? Speroni went back into nets for Palace and we saw Artur Boruc keep a clean sheet – thanks mainly to Andy Carroll – for Bournemouth shortly before his own 39th birthday, too.Julian Speroni will retain his place in goal for Crystal Palace against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday despite his high-profile error against Liverpool last weekend, with neither Vicente Guaita or Wayne Hennessey deemed fit enough yet to return to the first-team.“My first impressions back up the impressions Doug had when he met him and saw him play, but it’s a bit early for me to start singing his praises too highly. I’ve only had one training session with him. I’m happy to have a player of that type and quality, a youngster anxious to succeed here in England. Good 21-year-old goalkeepers are hard to find.”Speroni, 39, will be making his 405th appearance for Palace in all competitions in what is likely to prove his final season after a 15-year stint at Selhurst Park.Crystal Palace must be strong favourites for Sunday given spurs youth team will be the only players fit enough to play.I’m going to this one. I don’t know about “strong favourites”, but Palace will definitely fancy it. Spurs won’t fancy exiting both domestic cups in the space of 72 hours though – even if it’s not exactly their fault, it won’t be a great look and will write a few headlines.Which game are you going to this weekend, and why?Please do read this – our obituary to Hugh McIlvanney, a master of his craft, by Kevin Mitchell:Here’s a line from the Press Association relating to the awful case of Emiliano Sala. The search for him and his pilot has stopped but Lionel Messi is among those asking for it to continue:“Lionel Messi has joined calls for the search of the missing plane carrying Cardiff striker Emiliano Sala to be resumed. Guernsey Police called off the search for Sala and pilot David Ibbotson on Thursday afternoon, but the player’s former club Nantes led calls from across football for it to be resumed.“Barcelona star Messi, writing on his Instagram story, said: ‘As long as there are still possibilities, a hint of hope, we ask you please continue to look for Emiliano. I send all my strength and support to his family and friends. PrayforSala.’ “Messi’s message was accompanied by a photo of his fellow Argentinian.”At half-time in the Asian Cup quarter-final it is goalless between Qatar and South Korea.Can I trouble you with some more Higuain chatter? This time it’s from Gianfranco Zola, who is of course Maurizio Sarri’s assistant. He gave today’s pre-match press conference. Talk about rotating for the cup!I’m sure there are big expectations. I’m also sure Gonzalo is used to it. He’s played for big clubs: Real Madrid, Juventus, Napoli. I’m sure he can handle these expectations. He’s always produced good numbers wherever he’s been. He’s a player who can score in many ways so we hope that he can bring his qualities to this team - at this moment it is very much necessaryHe’s coming late, but he’s coming in a team that plays a system he knows very well, so this is a big advantage. Here there are the type of players who will help him to do what he can do best. The conditions are good.” Really nice from Stuart James, this, with Newport manager Mike Flynn and Tony Pulis’s brother Raymond. Newport face Middlesbrough tomorrow:You read Andy Hunter’s piece with Accrington a little earlier – now here is some hot-off-the-wires bullishness from their excellent manager, John Coleman:I wouldn’t be surprised if we beat them. I’d be delighted but I wouldn’t be surprised. We’re pleased we’re at home, that gives us more of a fighting chance. Derby are the favourites and rightly so, but I was intrigued by how readily all the pundits and the commentators were to write us off.When it all boils down to it, it’s 11 v 11 on Saturday. It’s not their fans versus our fans, it’s not that the fact that they’re a top Championship side with a load of money. At the nitty gritty it’s 11 v 11 and they’ve all got two arms and two legs so we’ll just get on with it.” The Championship is where it’s happening this weekend, no resting your best players, Farke ball and a win versus Sheffield United please many thanks :).Yes, a huge game at Carrow Road between Norwich (second) and Sheffield United (fourth, three points behind them). Two sides that you might have expected to fall away, but really haven’t. I think Norwich need to tighten up at the back if they’re to stay the course, but they’ve been mightily entertaining so far. The Blades have, too. What price a goal from former Ipswich striker David McGoldrick?It’s not about football but please have some more McIlvanney brilliance:Which parent should Watford fans choose? Javi Gracia has waded into that one, and may also be talking about league vs FA Cup:Who do you prefer? Do you prefer mummy or do you prefer daddy? It is the same. If you ask Watford supporters whether they want to reach the final or finish seventh, they will say they want to be first in the league, and to win the FA Cup, not seventh. That is our ambition, and that is our target.”Which relative does that make the League Cup? Or the EFL Trophy?Gonzalo Higuain, about whom Eden Hazard speaks a few posts down from this, could well make his Chelsea debut against Sheffield Wednesday on Sunday. He might need some time to get up to speed but I’m looking forward to seeing what he can do: Higuain is a proper gladiator of a number nine and an absolutely explosive finisher, and I’ve loved watching him down the years. Marcus Christenson wrote really nicely about him earlier in the week:I am always one of the first people to get tired of big clubs’ fans obsessing over minutiae at the expense of what is a vast, wondrous, infinitely textured world of football – but I’ll put it out there that Spurs would probably quite like Qatar to beat South Korea. It could mean they get Son Heung-min back for the Watford game in midweek and, given their current absentee list, that could be valuable.Chris Sato emails: “I have also been watching a lot of the Asian Cup. I was impressed with a very young Vietnam side, especially their number 10, who could conceivably make the grade in Europe. Iran look the team to beat, though Japan have been rotating their team through the tournament and are probably just getting into their stride.”What’s more important – Liverpool winning the league or Daniel Sturridge getting a new contract? Might be a tough one to you, but for the man himself (talking to BBC Radio 1 Extra) it’s a no-brainer:I’m staying focused on right now. You’ve got to live in the present, you can never live in the future. I’ve been at Liverpool a long time and I’m happy too. I want to try and help bring the team some success, to win a trophy with them would be amazing. We’ve come close before, finals, almost won the Premier League before but we didn’t quite do it.” I’m back, but far more importantly this is the great Hugh McIlvanney *nailing it*:Those French Fries were, like me in a playground dust-up, entirely insubstantial so I’m nipping out for a sandwich – back in 10, but we’ll see you right if anything important breaks in the meantime.Here, meanwhile, is some embargoed Spurs reaction from last night.Danny Rose on whether the weight of an 11-year trophy drought is proving insufferable:No. Not really. Obviously we know that we haven’t won a trophy in a while but we are not driving into training thinking about it. We are not training thinking about it. We’ve lost now and it’s not the first thing we are thinking about. We are fully aware that we want to win something but because it has not happened it doesn’t mean it is not going to happen any time soon.”First of all I am over the moon for Fernando. I hope it has shut a few people up. It’s a good header from him and we are over the moon and because he probably hasn’t featured as much as he’d like but now he is going to get a lot of game time with Harry out and its nice that he’s scored in the right net now and we hope he continues.”Harry Winks on the angst of missing out on another final:Yes. It’s horrible. To get this close to a final and to lose on penalties is always harder than probably losing in 90 minutes. Everyone is proud of ourselves. The way that we fought, the way that we showed our character. It just wasn’t our night.”Eden Hazard is relishing the prospect of playing alongside Gonzalo Higuaín at Chelsea and believes the Argentinian can have a similar positive effect to the departed Diego Costa at Stamford Bridge.Higuaín, who has joined from Juventus on an initial six-month loan with an option for a further 12 months for a fee of 18m Euros, was presented to the crowd prior to kick-off in the Carabao Cup semi-final win over Tottenham Hotspur on Thursday night and could make his debut in Sunday’s FA Cup fourth round tie against Sheffield Wednesday. His arrival will allow Hazard to revert to his preferred left-sided role, and should add to the armoury of a side who have scored only 13 goals in their last 12 topflight games.“For me, as a winger, I like to play with top players,” said Hazard. “With Chelsea I had the chance to play with one of the best in Diego Costa for three years, and Higuaín is one of the best. I also like to play with Olivier (Giroud) when he is playing, with Alvaro (Morata) when he was playing. I just try to have fun with my striker, playing the give and go. If the striker just goes deep, I am going to be in trouble, but Giroud understands this, and that’s why I like to play with him. He is more like a team player than just a striker who scores goal.“Diego was sometimes not this kind of player who you can play a 1-2 with, but in the box he was amazing. He would score a goal and you won and at the end you would have three points. That’s what we need. Higuaín is this kind of player. He can also link with the wingers and the midfield, but he can also be the proper striker. He has scored a lot of goals, when you see his career: Real Madrid, Napoli, Juventus, he has always scored goals. “This season we have been playing well, but sometimes we miss the one guy just to score one goal. So we had a couple of games where we played well but we didn’t score. We finished with zero goals, but we created a lot of chances. But Higuaín can do that. He is a top striker who can score everywhere.”Sounds as if Arnautovic will at least be reintegrated properly after the transfer window has *slammed shut*. But what a situation ...There’s still some doubt over whether Marko Arnautovic will be involved against AFC Wimbledon tomorrow night. Manuel Pellegrini says the West Ham forward has been training well after being dropped against Bournemouth last week, but the wantaway Austrian’s return in the FA Cup isn’t guaranteed. If he’s still moping about not being allowed to move to China, he probably won’t be selected.Millwall v Everton looks a very interesting tie to me. Marco Silva – neither the second coming nor a fraud, both of which have been variously proclaimed, but just an OK-ish manager – is under pressure and won’t want to lose at the Den. But towering, goalscoring centre-half Jake Cooper hopes he will!I am living in Vietnam and have been fortunate enough to be able to follow the Asia Cup. It has been an interesting tournament so far with a good many open attacking games and little in the way of cynical play acting.Sadly, Vietnam went out to Japan last night but had done tremendously well to reach the last eight. VAR which is only being used from the quarter finals onwards had a great influence on the game used to rule out one Japan goal and then to award them a penalty. Iran are also looking strong having breezed past China in last night’s other match.Tonight’s South Korea vs Qatar game will be intriguing. Korea are traditionally one of the stronger Asian sides but Qatar have an exciting side and a striker with huge potential in Almoez Ali. Expect Australia to go out against hosts UAE in the later match.Thanks for this (genuinely). Could we see a UAE v Qatar semi-final, then? Imagine!There is nothing wrong with rotating your squad for the FA Cup, says Chris Hughton, manager of mid-table Brighton:There will always be that balance and as a manager you have to make decisions, and these are big decisions. For where we are at the moment, it’s still very much about stability in the league and picking up league results.When you change a team and you use your squad, it’s not always just about making sure you don’t pick up injuries because you know you’ve got a game on Tuesday night. It’s about the squad and players that are not in the team at the moment that are training hard every day.There is a big value for the squad to keep them involved and for them to be playing some games. You would have players that are very, very close - maybe been on the bench but haven’t played so much - that would be thinking, ‘if I can’t play a cup game on a Saturday against so-and-so then it’s going to be very difficult for me’.”This is massively worth eight minutes of your time, I really can’t recommend it enough. Watch it and then tell me if *you* can do it on a freezing night in Nunavut:Excited by that, Palace fans? Sako has a hammer of a left foot and is a real talent when fit – not a bad one to have up your sleeve and, as Dominic says, he can cover more than one position.Crystal Palace are to re-sign the Mali international, Bakary Sako, from West Bromwich Albion with the player currently undergoing a medical at the Premier League club’s Beckenham training centre. Sako had departed Selhurst Park last summer after three injury-affected seasons in south London. Indeed, he had suffered a badly broken ankle in his final appearance for the club, at West Ham a little under a year ago.Palace had still been keen to re-sign the free agent once his contract expired in July, but had already filled their 25-man Premier League squad by the time the summer transfer deadline passed. Sako instead returned to the Black Country, where he had previously excelled for Wolverhampton Wanderers, with West Brom in the Championship but only returned to full fitness in late October and has been restricted to two league starts, scoring a solitary goal in the FA Cup third round victory over Wigan.Sako, who scored six goals under Roy Hodgson last season before that fracture at the London stadium, will return to provide cover both up front and wide, with Palace effectively taking on the last six months of his contract. The 30-year-old’s arrival on a short-term deal will end Palace’s interest in re-signing Yannick Bolasie from Everton.More news: I’m eating, or more correctly eating *from*, a packet of French Fries. I don’t even like them much – I didn’t realise they still existed! But the canteen had them and my eyes lit up in some sort of weird nostalgia trip. It’s like being in the school playground (or a comments section, haha etc) again.More on Burnley: they have defensive issues, namely at right-back, for the game at City, so we might see James Tarkowski fill in there again. Another chance for City’s kids to make hay? An email from Will, here:“Having watched Burton v Man City and seen numerous 12-year-olds make their debut. I was wondering if any will be rewarded with a place against Burnley on Saturday. Allow them to be tested by a Premier League team who are not 9-0 down. Who do you think is most likely to feature from the academy?”Ummm ... that Poveda lad?You’ve had a coffee or two now, so get your emails in. What’s occupying your mind ahead of this weekend? Keep it clean and loosely football-ish.This is in today’s paper and it’s excellent, so do take a few minutes for it: Andy Hunter spends a day with Accrington Stanley, who are more than a punchline in a milk advert these days!Will Burnley sign anyone to help with their relegation battle? Possibly, not probably, says Sean Dyche:It’s forever difficult. Possibles, not many probables, at the moment, and that’s just the way it is. January is very tough, everyone knows that, we don’t say it just to throw a line out there, I think it just is.We want the pressure. I wanted to bring in more in the last window. I made that clear to everyone, not because I don’t trust my players or rate them, because I do, but there’s only so much pressure as a manager you can put on players.There’s a different kind of healthy pressure which comes with new signings, with capable signings, because I was a player and you look around and think ‘I’ve got to look after myself’. That can enhance performances.” Given how our defence handled Ched Evans on Tuesday get your money on a record West Ham FA Cup win and Carroll hat-trick.For anyone that missed it, the Dons allowed Evans two goals in a woeful 3-0 home defeat to Fleetwood on Tuesday. They did a little better than that against West Ham in the League Cup a few months back, losing 3-1 ... what chance a significant improvement for the third tier’s bottom side when they face off again in the FA Cup?There’s more than one thing to look forward to this weekend. I’ll be specific: there are 10 things, and they are below.Yesterday I saw a suggestion that, even while out of work, Jardim still sees many of the Monaco players when he pops out to buy his (presumably diamond-encrusted) croissants every morning, so they won’t need to spend much time catching up.You might not know it because it’s all but impossible to find on TV in the UK, but the Asian Cup is currently happening. It’s at the quarter-final stage and there are two games coming up today: South Korea v Qatar and UAE v Australia. If I can catch sight or sound of either, I’ll keep you in the loop about how they’re going. By all means send some thoughts about this shortsightedly blackouted competition, too. It’ll educate us!On the subject of Pellegrini – has he calmed the Arnautovic storm for now? Doesn’t look like the Austrian is going to get his China wish at the moment, and if he does then the Hammers will have precious little time to replace him. But what impact will dropping him last weekend have?Manuel Pellegrini is up with the lark ahead of West Ham’s visit to AFC Wimbledon. And he has words of advice for youngsters Declan Rice and Grady Diangana, who have both signed new deals recently:Diangana deserves it, he has taken a step with the squad of our team – he was in the under 23s before and now he is working every day with our squad. I think he has a lot of quality and we will see an important player in the future of this club. Now his development will depend on his ambitions and his mind, to try to improve every day.I try always to tell young players that they are in the most dangerous part of their careers, when they think that they have arrived but they have not arrived yet. They have started arriving, but they must improve every day working with professional players.Fortunately for me in all the teams I managed before I’ve had young players to try to develop their qualities. I hope West Ham will be exactly the same. Declan started improving a lot, he played last season, now we have Grady to help to be an important player for West Ham.” Juan Mata couldn’t sign for Arsenal ... could he? Sort the wheat from the chaff in today’s Rumour Mill:Last night we heard the very sad news that Hugh McIlvanney, a genuine legend of sportswriting and inspiration to so many, has died aged 84. A number of memories and tributes are gathered here – and you can leave your own below the piece:Where’s it all gone wrong for Thierry Henry then? I was down in Monaco last week to watch them play Nice, spoke to him briefly and got the impression he felt things were coming together a little. But I also sensed frustration at quite a few things: his players, the league in general, VAR ... is it the case, perhaps, that there’s a bit of the Roy Keane there? A man who can’t necessarily tolerate the weaknesses or foibles of others?Here we ... here we ... here we jolly well go! It’s time to get our Friday on and it’s a busy one. Our main focus, in terms of matches at least, is the FA Cup fourth round – with Arsenal hosting Manchester United tonight and plenty more spread throughout the weekend. I’ll start us off by showing you the fixtures:But we can talk about anything else that takes our fancy, too. Thierry Henry is about to be shown the door at Monaco! Chelsea are in the League Cup final! There are some vital Championship games tomorrow, including Norwich v Sheffield United at the top! Tell me what’s getting you talking ahead of this footballing weekend – email address and Twitter are above."},{"url":null,"title":"success for me wouldve been three grand the gamer who raised 340000 for a trans charity hbomberguy","story":"Hbomberguy’s marathon 57-hour gaming session attracted the attention of the industry and celebrities alike. We meet the man trying to counter the tide of the manosophere and alt-rightPlaying a video game for 57 hours sounds like either heaven or hell, depending on who you are. But when it generates massive online buzz, garnering the attention of a sitting US congresswoman and Hollywood celebrities, and nets a charity for trans kids $340,000, it’s safe to assume you’ve done something good for the world. The person responsible for playing those hours, “Hbomberguy” – real name Harry Brewis, a YouTube essayist – did not set out to get the attention of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Chelsea Manning, Mara Wilson and other popular figures. But he did.When I spoke to Brewis, he was still stunned by the attention but he seemed upbeat and elated by the experience.Brewis’s YouTube work consists of critical video essays on everything from BBC’s Sherlock to a 45-minute debunking of modern flat-earthers. His channel is one of the more popular ones countering the growing tide of the manosphere and alt-right. He is also a passionate, insightful game critic: he has an hour-long essay on why Fallout 3 is bad, and a shorter one on why Braid is excellent. Along with other insightful, lefty video essay channels such as Shaun, Contrapoints, and Philosophy Tube, Hbomberguy’s choice of topics are not limited to any one genre or medium. Instead, the only consistent part is Brewis himself – or rather his “Hbomberguy” character.For Brewis, because games often contain the packaged worldviews of their creators, they are an avenue to talk about a range of issues. “It turns out that video games are an important part of a lot of people’s lives,” he says. “They are definitely a part of how I learned to grow up and change as a person. By talking about games in this wider way, adjacent to talking about politics, I do end up accidentally getting people to think about things I couldn’t have done otherwise.”For last weekend’s stream, he chose Donkey Kong 64 because it’s a game that has haunted him for years, one he spent hours on as a kid but never finished. He chose to donate the proceeds to Mermaids, a UK charity that provides support for transgender and gender-variant children and young people: “Living in Britain, I find the media discussion surrounding this issue to be woefully misinformed,” he says. He was spurred on by Graham Linehan, who helped orchestrate an email campaign that saw Mermaids denied lottery funding late last year. It was partly this publicity, perhaps, that drew attention to Brewis’s fundraising efforts.Helping him behind the scenes were a range of trans people. Fellow streamer and Twitter personality Casey Explosion was central to the entire operation: managing the server, arranging the chats to get interesting people on, staying up longer than anyone, including Brewis himself – all without being asked. Brewis regards her as the hero of the stream. Speaking to the Escapist, Explosion said: “It felt like the entire internet showed up for trans rights.”Brewis didn’t set out to become a lefty pop culture critic, he says. “I started doing this with the intent of having some laughs and getting people thinking about complex issues. Then an inordinate amount of people came to support me and it became the thing I did for a living. I got interested in bits of media I found fun and then one day I woke up and I was a socialist.” He laughs and says: “They tricked me!”Given how polarised internet discussions around both pop culture and politics have become, Brewis and his fellow leftwing YouTubers’ work is important. When you talk to young men who have begun to challenge the alt-right views that are dominant in some places where gamers gather on the Internet, they will often say that Hbomberguy started to change their minds. Watching his videos, it is easy to be drawn in due to his humour and friendliness. “I try and be as friendly and open to people as possible so people feel safe… How do I welcome into the fold people who would otherwise be my enemy?” he says. “The less condemnatory I am of people, the more of an option I give them.”Brewis’s extraordinarily successful Donkey Kong stream proves, for him, that there is hope: “There’s way more people out there who care than you’d believe.” As more famous people both within the gaming community and out dropped in to the stream, you could see him struggling to believe what was happening.“I discovered that so many of my personal heroes in gaming, the thing that I thought had a penchant for the regressive, had always been here. That was the real thing for me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c156a565e4a3cb5c58189fd5efe6b03c35a3bf36/0_488_3648_2188/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cc3d4dba95ed57dba6e3bd28e6b739a","title":"experience i am a professional competitive eater","story":"I hold Wing Bowl’s record for eating 501 chicken wings in 30 minutes. In 2018, my prize was $5,000 and a Hyundai SonataA lot of people can’t believe what I do for a living. I don’t fit the profile. I’m 5ft 7in and weigh 120 pounds. But I can eat 48 slices of pumpkin pie in 10 minutes and get paid for it.I stumbled into competitive eating. In 2012, I was working in a bar in Nebraska and its restaurant had a challenge: if you ate its 5lb (2.2kg) hamburger, which is about the diameter of a soccer ball, you got it for free. Someone bet me I couldn’t do it, so I just ate it. I didn’t think it was a big deal but everyone else did. I undertook a couple of similar challenges. There was a burger joint down the road and I ended up taking its record. Then they put me in a face-off with the previous record-holder. After that, things snowballed.At first, I only wanted to do challenges, not contests where you’re facing all these people and trying to win money. I have four kids, and I was too busy. But in 2013, I was invited to a competition in Connecticut. I won two contests back-to-back and earned more in four minutes than I could make in two weeks at work. I quit my job after that.Competitive eating is becoming more and more popular. There are probably about 100 professionals. Prize money varies greatly, and there are very few people who can earn all their income from doing this – maybe two or three in the US.One of my earliest challenges was eating a 72oz (2kg) steak. That’s about the size of a loaf of bread. I ate it in under three minutes, more than halving the record. I’ve also eaten 119 dumplings in two minutes. I just swallowed them whole – there was no time for chewing. And I got a Guinness World Record for eating 12lbs (5kg) of pudding in three minutes. That’s my only Guinness record, because I never turn them in officially I don’t need to appear in a book.I’ve won Wing Bowl three times – a contest to see who can eat the most chicken wings in half an hour. It’s held in a sports arena in Philadelphia on the Friday of Super Bowl weekend, in front of 20,000 people, and all the crowd are drunk. In 2018 my prize was $5,000 and a Hyundai Sonata. I hold its record for eating 501 chicken wings in 30 minutes. That’s probably my proudest achievement.You can train for this, though. For instance, you can drink a lot of water to stretch your stomach. The after-effects of a contest depend on how much you eat. If I eat 5lbs or 10lbs of something, I’ll be fine – I’ll even go for a meal afterwards. But if I eat 25lbs of something, my body’s going to kick it out. I also go through spurts of losing weight when I’m sick of eating. It can become a chore.We’re in the off-season now because most contests are held outdoors. In the summer, I travel most weekends, and I’ve met so many cool people. There’s no typical eater we have teachers, military personnel, people who work in restaurants. I could do up to 20-25 contests a year, and I make substantially more than I did in my bartending job – above an average US wage.But I’ve never gloated – once you start saying you’re the best, that’s the day you’re going to lose. I don’t go into a contest telling anybody who I am, or trash-talking. I’m quiet. Sometimes the other competitors get mad and complain when I beat them: “It’s not fair, why did you invite a professional?” I’ve heard it all.My kids know what I do for a living, but I don’t flaunt it in front of them, and they don’t come to the contests. It’s not a nice world to be in. People are critical of what we do, or make rude comments. They think we’re wasteful. But if you’ve ever overeaten at Thanksgiving, or gone to a buffet and eaten more than you should, you’ve done the same thing – only I’m getting paid.As told to Nige Tassell• Do you have an experience to share?

Now the company has a new target group: the grandparents.In a departure for the Shropshire-based company, it has created a range of bikes aimed specifically for riders aged 65 or more, seeking to use its experience in shrinking and adapting components for little hands to create bikes suited to the reduced flexibility and muscular strength of older age.The bikes feature easy-to-mount frames, with low gears for hills and other tweaks – for example, tyres that are easy to take off in the event of a puncture even for people with reduced grip strength.Isla Rowntree, the firm’s eponymous founder and boss, says she has grander ambitions: challenging the stereotype of advanced age being little more than a gradual chronology of decrepitude.As such, she has insisted that any advertising images for the bikes will show people who are not only 65 and above, but – unlike the case for many products aimed at such age groups – very obviously look like they are.“I’ve been really assertive with our marketing colleagues that we will picture genuine elderly people on these bikes, we will say who they’re for and we’re going to celebrate what those people represent – that they’re active, important, relevant and to be listened to,” she said. “I said I wanted people who really look their age, and look fabulous.”Redefining old age might seem a slight over-reach for a relatively niche bicycle company, but Rowntree styles herself as a campaigner as well as a businesswoman.A vehement advocate for better everyday cycling infrastructure, Rowntree is also a passionate environmentalist. One company project involves trying to make zero-waste children’s bikes that are rented rather than bought, and returned to the firm for refurbishment once the rider has outgrown the model.Islabikes came about after friends and relatives asked their resident cycling expert – Rowntree is a former UK cyclocross champion – for advice on bikes for young children, and she found most of them were cumbersome, weighty and poorly designed.The new range had a similar genesis. Rowntree observed how her parents, who are “keen recreational cyclists” in their mid-70s and live next door to her in Ludlow, began to have difficulties using their existing bikes.While their fitness remained good, their muscular strength had declined, she says, making low bike weight and a big range of gears important: “For the last few years, whenever I’ve changed a part on my mother’s bike, every time she’ll ask me: ‘Is it heavier than the bit you’ve taken off?’ It never was, but that was her concern.“It’s the same with gears – if you give them a low enough bottom gear they’ll winch their way up just about anything, but they don’t have the muscular strength to heave it up. All this isn’t rocket science, but it makes so much difference.”The three-bike range is primarily aimed at people who already enjoy cycling, and thus have price tags that might startle novices or dabblers. The cheapest, an everyday bike called the Joni – they all have baby boomer-referencing names – is £800, while the lighter and more sophisticated Janis, for road riding, and Jimi, a mountain bike, cost £1,200.Many older cyclists use e-bikes, which provide pedalling assistance from a small electric motor. Rowntree says her range is intended for “people who want to ride under their own steam for as long as possible, and then might switch to an e-bike when they need to”.For all the similarities in redesigning bikes for children and older people, there is one clear ergence: unlike young riders, adults generally have to brave the roads rather than happily pedalling through traffic-free parks or on pavements.Rowntree accepts that this is an issue for many who would like to cycle: “I’d love to get to a time when I’m at a social event and when people find out I ride a bike that they don’t reply: ‘You’re brave.’ That happens to me all the time. Regardless of the statistics, if people don’t feel safe then they won’t ride.”Faced by the Islabike Joni, Jeremy Adams, 76, is immediately struck – and impressed – by one aspect of the bike aimed at older riders.“I’m pleased to see the complete absence of a crossbar,” he says, examining the low, step-through frame. “Apart from an artificial knee I also have a bit of arthritis on the hip, so raising my leg a full balletic lift would have been possible but definitely uncomfortable.”While the bike is primarily aimed at older people who still ride, the retired museum curator from Lewes in East Sussex is a potentially tougher proposition to impress, confessing he last spent much time in the saddle about 20 years ago.But after some time poking, prodding and then lifting up the machine – “It’s surprising light” – Adams sets off for a tryout and returns impressed, even with “a few hundred yards of fairly cautious riding” to get used to the responsive disc brakes, a type he had not used before.“It was great fun – I can’t remember enjoying a bicycle so much,” Adams says. “If I was to have a long-term relationship with the bike I would make a couple of little adjustments. I’d probably have a more cushioned seat, and raise the handlebars a little bit, but these are minor things.”Even the £800 price tag is not as much of a shock as it might have been: “My son-in-law leaves these cycling magazines lying around with bikes in it that cost £5,000, so this doesn’t seem too bad by comparison.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d42d85780076468b516c0ed1cbb4c188d1294f8c/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac23a0ce5c1c0f925378a91b8afe8ea6","title":"10 simple signs that youve turned into a responsible adult","story":"Being a child meant no responsibilities. Being adolescent meant ignoring them. But now that you’re a grownup, there’s no running away. Thankfully, there are 10 simple ways to show you’re tackling adulthood like a proRecyclingThere was a time when all your rubbish went into one bin. Not any more. Now it’s a military operation – food, paper, cardboard, bottles and plastic all need to be separated and placed in specific colour-coded containers. But you’re well-drilled, you know the weekly collection rota and you have all the rubbish out the night before. You’ve nailed it.Weekly shopsNo more grazing on sweets in corner shops or picking up a ready meal on the way home from work. You climb in the car on Saturday mornings and drive to a supermarket on the outskirts of town and buy enough groceries to last you all week, resulting in a three-figure bill. Or you order it all online and have it delivered. But it still takes one simple thing that demonstrates you’re an adult: forward planning.Growing plants and vegetablesThis was something that once struck you as OAP behaviour and, frankly, back-breaking work. Then you discovered homegrown vegetables actually taste better and that growing a few plants is good for the soul. Now you visit garden centres and buy tools. Don’t eat at the garden centre cafe, though, that really is for old folk.Work the central heatingIt feels like you have two choices: hand over half your salary to the energy company or freeze. Real adults have mastered the central heating thermostat and the boiler timer and save money and energy as a result. It’s not rocket science, after all. Bonus tip: sign up to EnergyCheck from Compare the Market and it’ll contact you if you could save money on your bill.CleanOnce upon a time, your parents made you clean your room and it felt like punishment. Now you have your own place that is entirely your responsibility to take care of. You embrace it, grab some dusters, spray furniture polish, put on some music and bask in the thrill of sparkling surfaces.Stack the dishwasher correctlyYou used to balk at the washing up. Now you have a dishwasher and know that by arranging the plates at the back, bowls at the front, cutlery upright and cups on the top, it functions properly. Simple chore – such ordered joy.VotingCouncil election, general election, referendum – no matter what it is, you always find the time to vote. When you were younger, you didn’t even know where the polling station was, but then you realised you were making a huge mistake. It was your future they were deciding, after all.Assembling furnitureAs a kid, your parents expected you to make your bed. Now, when you buy one, you actually have to assemble it, too. In fact, all new furniture comes flatpacked, necessitating a crash course in DIY, a properly stocked toolbox and the ability to follow a badly translated set of instructions.Hold a dinner partyGetting a pizza in for the big match is a thing of the past. Now it’s all couples and entertaining. In best MasterChef style, you can prepare and cook at least three dishes, because melting cheese on nachos and buying an M\u0026ampS cheesecake just doesn’t cut it any more.Going to bed at a sensible timeStaying up until dawn gaming or clubbing might be possible at the weekend, but midweek you need a full eight hours or you’re tetchy the next day. Then you get run-down, and you know what happens when you get rundown: it all goes horribly wrong.Prove you’re an adult and download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck so you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

From planning meals to advice on decreasing the time you spend managing bills, here are some handy online resources to help tackle time-consuming everyday tasksThere are a few things in life that are seemingly never-ending: taxes, bills and housework, for example. According to research by the Association of Accounting Technicians, adults carry out an average of 109 life-admin tasks a year. The poll, which surveyed 2,000 Britons, found more than half of those taking part struggle to keep up with household paperwork and failed to complete everything by the required date.It also found that four urgent and important tasks are always in the pipeline. Mustering the effort to get them done is another issue altogether, but putting in a bit of effort can save a lot of time – and stress – in the long run. Here are some tips on how to keep on top of things.Offload meal prepEven with an Instagram-worthy pantry, sometimes just deciding what to eat for dinner can be a drain. Luckily, in the past few years, there has been a boom in subscription services. Companies such as HelloFresh allow you to choose up to five meals a week and have all the ingredients and recipes delivered to your door. Allplants is similar but caters to vegans, while Graze will sort out your snacks, and Naked Wines will make sure to deliver some nice wine to enjoy with whatever you cook.Get reminders whenever you can save money on billsCompare the Market has made it simple with EnergyCheck, a service that automatically checks if you could get a better deal than your current energy supplier. Tell them your gas and electricity usage once and you’ll never have to overpay again. Choose your ideal saving amount (£50 or £100, for example) and update your preferences on the go. You’ll get alerts to let you know if you can save, or if you’re still on a great deal – and you can switch energy providers simply.Cut time on managing billsManaging bills and paying them on time is one of the most common life-admin tasks and one that can have expensive consequences if they are not dealt with on time. Apps such as Splitwise help split bills between groups – such as housemates – so everyone pays a fair share and knows exactly what they owe. WonderBill gets all your household bills in one place, so there is no sifting through piles of paperwork or old emails to figure out which one needs to be paid and when.Automate your savingsSaving money can be a strain if you’re struggling to budget. But bank apps and money bots are great for finding ways to stockpile your piggy bank. Some allow users to set up savings “pots”, which automatically round up purchases to the nearest pound and collect the leftover change, which adds up surprisingly quickly. Then there are AI chatbots such as Cleo or Plum, which take the thinking out of money management by learning their users’ spending habits and sending out personalised prompts that remind them to put a little bit away for a rainy day.Make the most of your appsHaving all your devices sync together and talk seamlessly can save you a lot of time. If This Then That (IFTTT) is a platform that helps make this a reality. It allows you to create customised “applets” and use ones others have created to make day-to-day tasks a little bit easier. It works on the premise of “if this happens, then that happens”. So, for example, if you complete a workout on a fitness app then Google logs it in your calendar.Clean up your computerOne way to save time before you even begin a life-admin task is having everything properly organised – including on your computer. But, with all the photos, files, and apps that gradually pile up, organising your laptop can be a major life-admin task in itself. Using apps such as Hazel will help automatically organise files based on name, date and file type – plus you can have it rename files and sort them into subfolders so they can be accessed, deleted or backed up. To start automating your life, download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck so you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

Those taken sometimes die as a result. Is it time to rethink? By  Joel SimonIn 1982, a British insurance broker named Doug Milne set out in search of new markets. His speciality was kidnapping and ransom insurance, known in the industry as K\u0026ampR. Milne enrolled in a Spanish-language course in London, and a month later, with rudimentary skills and only one or two solid contacts on the ground, he boarded a flight to Bogotá. On his first day in the Colombian capital, Milne was walking to a meeting with a potential client when, he recalled, “a guy pulled up alongside and this chap who was walking in front of me, his head just exploded”. It was a drive-by assassination.Milne cancelled the meeting and spent the afternoon in a bar near Bogotá’s entertainment district. “I missed my meeting and I think I left there about 11pm after having drunk a couple of flagons of Tres Esquinas rum,” Milne told me. He was, of course, horrified. But he also realised that he’d come to the right place. While he knew nothing about the victim or the motive, the murder drove home to him the extent to which Colombian society was at the mercy of criminals and guerillas. His clients needed what he had to offer.Kidnapping and ransom insurance was created in the 1930s, but it wasn’t until the 60s that it began to really catch on, following a spate of kidnappings in Europe by groups such as Eta in Spain, the Red Army Faction in Germany and the Red Brigades in Italy. The appeal was simple: in the event of a kidnapping, the insurance would provide reimbursement for ransom payment.There were caveats to prevent fraud and to ensure that the existence of the policy did not actually increase the risk of kidnapping. The first was that the policy had to be kept secret. In fact, it could be voided if its existence became public. The concern was that if the kidnappers knew of the policy, they would demand more money.The second principle is that the policy will only reimburse the ransom once it is paid. The insurance company never fronts any money. In order to raise the cash, the victim’s family will probably have to liquidate assets – mortgage the house, sell stocks, pool money from other relatives. This process makes the negotiations credible by dragging them out. This is not just about minimising the payout by the insurance company. Quickly making good on a large ransom raises the expectations of future kidnappers. It can make hostage-taking more lucrative and more common.When K\u0026ampR insurance first came on the market, the policyholders were left on their own to negotiate with the kidnappers. But in the mid-1970s, an insurance broker named Julian Radcliffe came up with an idea that would revolutionise the industry. Along with a few colleagues, Radcliffe convinced their company to set up a subsidiary focused on hostage response. The subsidiary, which they named Control Risks, would hire security experts – mostly former military and police – to handle negotiations. The cost of hiring the consultant was included in the policy and borne by the insurance company. In 1982, Control Risks became an independent company.By the early 80s, hostage-taking was on the rise in Latin America, particularly in Colombia. When Milne arrived in Bogotá, he discovered a vast, untapped market. As an insurance broker, he sold a variety of policies offered by different companies available through the Lloyd’s exchange in London. The job of the broker is to serve the client and to advocate for their interests in the event of a claim. The underwriters represent the insurance companies. Specialised, high-risk policies were placed on the Lloyd’s insurance exchange, and Milne would field offers from different underwriters. He would select the policy that best suited his client.To his South American clients, Milne was as quintessentially British as James Bond. He attended boarding school in Scotland, and dresses in tailored suits with a perfectly positioned pocket square. He enjoys a stiff drink, sometimes two. “When I went to Colombia, everyone wanted to see me,” Milne told me. “I started with a few contacts, but it grew like Topsy. All their friends at the golf club wanted to meet. It suddenly became a viable business.”Some grumble that in an industry that values discretion, Milne is a bit of self-promoter. But no one denies his success. By the time he wrapped up his stint in Latin America in the 1990s, he had sold hundreds of new policies, recruited a specialised team in London focusing on the Latin America market, and developed a new service to provide risk mitigation – a “preventative training” programme that educated clients on how to reduce the risk of kidnap and how to respond if it does happen. He then convinced insurance companies that they should foot the bill. (After all, both insurance companies and their clients have an interest in reducing the likelihood of a kidnapping.)London is the global centre for K\u0026ampR insurance, but it has not always been a comfortable fit. Different countries take different approaches to dealing with the kidnapping of their nationals – and the UK, along with the US, has long been a leader of the so-called “no concessions” camp, officially refusing to negotiate with terrorists, pay ransom or make concessions.In April 1986, Jennifer Guinness, the wife of banker and member of the Guinness brewing family John Guinness, was kidnapped by a gang that demanded a ransom of £2m. She was rescued in a police raid only eight days after being abducted. But the fact that a K\u0026ampR policy had been triggered and Control Risks were brought in to negotiate a possible ransom sparked outrage. “Private security firms such as the ones called in on the Guinness kidnapping are operating at the very frontiers of official tolerance,” a top police official announced.The Thatcher government charged that the insurance industry was fuelling a global kidnapping epidemic, facilitating the payment of ransom and undermining the British no-concessions policy. The logic of that policy is that paying ransom puts a target on the back of British citizens, increasing the risk of future kidnappings. It also puts money into the hands of terrorist organisations, which is used to finance their ongoing operations.In 1986, the issue of K\u0026ampR insurance was debated in parliament, which passed a motion expressing concern. There was even talk of working through European institutions to impose a ban on K\u0026ampR insurance throughout the European Union. Recognising that its existence was under threat, the security industry rallied, arguing that since the policies were kept secret, it was clear that people were not being kidnapped because they had insurance. Rather, they were being taken hostage because they had resources – and banning insurance would not change this. Since the policies only provided reimbursement and were always written for amounts less than the net worth of the policyholder, the industry also argued that insurance did not drive up the amount of payment. What’s more, the industry pointed out that the availability of K\u0026ampR insurance helped international businesses to manage risk, which in turn allowed companies – including British and European companies – to operate in dangerous environments while exercising appropriate “duty of care” toward their employees.While the British and European debate eventually wound down without new legislation being introduced, inidual countries throughout the world continued to wrestle with how best to respond to kidnapping. Italy, for example, passed a law in 1991 that banned the payment of ransom and the sale of K\u0026ampR insurance. (One consequence was that the families of kidnapped Italian citizens simply stopped reporting the crimes to the authorities.) Meanwhile, Colombia banned ransom payments, then unbanned, then banned them again. Spain operates a very different policy, where its intelligence services are told to bring hostages home at all costs. Because of its willingness to pay, the country has a tremendous record of success.Through the debates and policy changes, the K\u0026ampR industry not only survived but thrived. Then came September 11 2001, which changed the terms of the whole discussion. Rather than challenging the K\u0026ampR industry as a whole, governments increasingly sought to draw a clearer distinction between criminal groups, to whom ransom could legally be paid, and terror groups, to whom it could not. The US and UK governments both maintained lists of Foreign Terrorist Organizations who could not receive ransom payments. In industry parlance, these groups were designated as “proscribed”.This attempt to draw distinctions between criminal and terrorist organisations raised many tricky questions. It was clear that K\u0026ampR policies could not reimburse policyholders who paid a ransom to a terrorist group. But could security consultants handle negotiations? Could they help families to raise and assemble the funds? And what about the families themselves? Would they be held legally liable for paying ransom to terrorists? “It’s all a grey area,” Milne acknowledged.Further complicating the process is the fact that kidnappers often try to hide their identity. Hostage negotiators told me that some terror groups pretend to be criminal organisations so they can collect ransoms. The opposite also occurs. Criminal groups who are ignorant of the legal prohibitions sometimes pretend to be terror organisations in the hopes that the fearsome reputation of these groups will push negotiations along. Under the law, the onus is on the insurance company to demonstrate that kidnappers are “proscribed” in order to invalidate the policy. Negotiators working for the victim’s family would sometimes refrain from asking obvious questions about the group holding the hostage. They simply preferred not to know.Meanwhile, decisions about which groups were designated as terrorists were often politically determined and sometimes arbitrary. For example, a 2011 case, Masefield AG v Amlin Corporate Member, determined that the payment of ransom to Somali pirates was legal under British law. As a result, Somali pirates were presumed to be criminals rather than terrorists, even when ties to al-Shabaab militants were alleged. Meanwhile, it was illegal to pay ransom to a criminally oriented kidnapping cell in Nigeria if they were seen to have ties to proscribed groups such as Boko Haram.In effect, the collision of disparate national policies and the insurance market creates complexities that determine who lives and who dies in international kidnapping cases. In 2008, a Canadian journalist, Amanda Lindhout, was kidnapped in Somalia, along with an Australian colleague, Nigel Brennan. As young freelancers, they did not have insurance. Officially, neither Canada nor Australia pay ransom. Driven by desperation, their families found a way forward.The one factor in their favour was that the group that kidnapped the pair was a criminal and not a terror organisation. Because they were not “terrorists,” the Canadian government entered into negotiations, offering to build a school or provide development aid in exchange for Lindhout’s release. But the kidnappers wanted cash. They tortured Lindhout to put more pressure on her family, which had few resources. Realising that the negotiations were going nowhere, Lindhout’s mother, Lorinda Stewart, decided that the only hope was to pay a ransom. Canadian officials warned Stewart that paying ransom was against the law and that she could be prosecuted for doing so, but she forged ahead.Once Stewart made the decision, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which had been handling the case, withdrew all support. The hostage-negotiation team that had been camped in her living room moved out. Stewart, working with the Brennan family in Australia, eventually raised enough money to hire a security consultant from London-based firm AKE to take over the negotiations. The consultant advised the families that negotiations would take several months and they would have to pay a ransom of around $600,000 each. His prediction was spot on. Lindhout and Brennan were freed in November 2009. Their families ended up in massive debt.In some cases, US and British hostages have also been freed through dramatic rescues. On 25 January 2012, US Navy Seals dropped into Somalia and rescued kidnapped US aid worker Jessica Buchanan and her Danish colleague Poul Thisted, shooting dead nine of their kidnappers. Officials had decided to launch a rescue because Buchanan had developed a kidney infection, and they believed her life was in danger. Negotiations, which were being carried out by a security consultant and monitored by the FBI, were not progressing fast enough. Most importantly, the US had good intelligence on the hostages’ location and ideal weather conditions for a successful rescue.Despite such successes, rescuing hostages through military force is not a scalable solution to international hostage-taking. Only a handful of countries have the military capacity to pull off such a raid, and they are also extremely risky. According to industry data, either a hostage or a rescuer is killed in half of all rescue operations. One tragic example was the 2009 raid carried out by British special forces in Afghanistan that freed kidnapped New York Times reporter Steve Farrell, but led to the death of a British soldier along with two Afghan civilians. Farrell’s Afghan colleague, journalist Sultan Munadi, was also killed, possibly shot accidentally by British forces. These deaths were all the more tragic because private negotiators who were communicating with the kidnappers already had a deal for both hostages’ release. It was not clear that the British government was ever aware.In September 2011, a dramatic case tested the resolve of the British authorities’ no-concession policy, when a British couple, Judith (“Jude”) and David Tebbutt, were attacked by Somali pirates while vacationing in Kenya. Their son Ollie, a 25-year-old furniture designer, was at a job site in Glasgow when a colleague came to tell him that the police wanted to see him. “Because my parents were on holiday, I assumed something bad had happened, like maybe a car crash,” Tebbutt recalled.After a week-long safari, his parents had booked a stay in a secluded resort called the Kiwayu Safari Village on the Kenyan coast. One night, Somali kidnappers raided the property and abducted his mother. His father David was killed trying to resist.For weeks after being given the news, Ollie was in close contact with the Foreign Office. He was also visited by representatives from SO15, the counterterrorism command of the British politan police, who were investigating the possible involvement of members of al-Shabaab in the abduction. Eventually, Ollie was able to arrange a proof-of-life telephone call with his mother. The kidnappers wanted a huge sum – around $10m. But Ollie discovered that tucked into a travel insurance policy obtained through his father’s work was a clause that provided kidnapping and ransom insurance. “It was incredibly lucky, really,” Ollie said.Through the policy, two security consultants from Control Risks were assigned to the case. “That’s when the government said: ‘You have to make a choice – it’s either us or them.’” Ollie recalled. He found the security consultants to be sober professionals. They explained how the negotiations would work, and that the sole focus would on getting his mother back alive. “They were very much like, we do this every day, and this is expected in this part of the world, and this is our pattern for what a Somali kidnap looks like,” he said.Meanwhile, the government representatives explained that Britain did not pay ransom, and would not countenance any arrangement that put money in the hands of terrorists. While the identity of the kidnappers was murky, the line between al-Shabaab militants, pirates and criminals in Somalia was a fluid one. The best that British officials could offer the family was to essentially walk away – to put what they called “clear water” between the government and any negotiations. Their rather charitable interpretation was that since the kidnappers were demanding money they had to be criminals.As an only child, Ollie was the family’s point person in the negotiations. He moved into his parents’ home, and over the next six months negotiations were carried out around the kitchen table. They were surprisingly orderly. After each phone call, the kidnappers would arrange a follow-up conversation. Generally, they kept their appointments. A Control Risks consultant would brief him on what to say, and sit by his side. A representative from the politan police monitored the discussions, but did not participate or interfere.The Tebbutts were a comfortable middle-class family, but did not have millions. Ollie found the kidnappers had a pretty good sense of the value of their hostage, and over the next few months, under the guidance of the Control Risks negotiator, their demands steadily dropped. They finally agreed to accept a ransom of around £600,000. The only way Ollie was able to come up with that sum was to use the death benefits he received following his father’s murder.In March 2012, Ollie and the negotiator travelled to Nairobi to make the final arrangements. Control Risks contracted a pilot to drop the money, but there were some tense moments when the authorities that controlled the local airstrip demanded a larger cut. Once that was worked out, and the kidnappers indicated they were prepared to release their hostage, things changed. “At that point, the security consultant drove me to a crossroads in Nairobi,” he recalled. “On one side there was a jeep with the Foreign Office guys in it, and I just crossed the road and got in their car. That was the last time I saw anyone from Control Risks.”From that point on, the British government took over. British officials travelled to the Nairobi airport to collect Jude, and then took her to the British high commission, where she was reunited with her son. Eventually, the full ransom that Ollie had paid was reimbursed under the terms of the K\u0026ampR policy.On the one hand, Ollie is grateful that the British government allowed him to pay a ransom despite the fact that his mother’s kidnappers may have been linked to al-Shabaab. (A British researcher told me that he visited the FCO office to discuss the case while Jude was being held, and was told the government was not interested in hearing any information about the terrorist ties of the kidnappers.) On the other hand, his experience caused him to focus on what he sees as the hypocrisy and heartlessness of the government’s position. In order to apply pressure, Jude’s kidnappers were depriving her of food, slowly starving her to death. If negotiations had dragged on for a few more months, “she would have died for sure,” Ollie believes.Ollie is soft-spoken and understated, but he told me he thinks the British government’s policy is “so crazy”. He continued: “It makes absolutely no sense. I don’t believe for a second that the kidnappers are checking passports or trying to figure out who is from where. They just grab whoever they can. I don’t think the British policy protects people in a way that they claim it does, but they are so entrenched in this idea. The idea that they get to choose who a terrorist group is based on pretty flimsy reasons sometimes. At the same time, governments sell weapons or trade with regimes that are incredibly bad.”The logic of the no-concessions policy, he believes, is that a certain number of hostages must die in order for the government to show its resolve. If the British government had designated Jude Tebbutt’s kidnappers as terrorists, he says, “my mum would not have come home.”Security consultants and private negotiators fill a critical role in hostage recovery, and have an undeniable record of success in criminal cases. They can even do some things that governments can’t, such as credibly claim limited resources as a strategy to get the price down. Governments, of course, can’t plead poverty.Yet the whole system, as imperfect as it already is, breaks down in terrorism-related cases. If the victim is from a “no-concessions” country, security consultants can offer only limited support. If the victim is from a country that negotiates, such as France or Spain, the private security consultant is generally asked to step aside while national intelligence agencies takes over. While the security consultants are pleased to see their clients come home, they are not happy about the massive payouts.“The market is now too inflated,” one experienced security consultant told me. “Governments have deep pockets and are basically unable to do what a traditional K\u0026ampR consultant would do, which is to put up resistance, to claim an inability to pay, to bargain, to try and disincentivise the crime.”Such arguments may seem self-serving, but there is evidence to support them. In one case, a New York Times journalist who was captured in Afghanistan in 2008 tried to argue with his captors, who were demanding $25m and the release of 15 prisoners. He told them they were out of touch. They countered that the French had recently paid $38m for the release of an aid worker, and that an Italian journalist had been ransomed for $15m and the release of several prisoners. Quickly capitulating to high ransom demands – as some European and Asian governments have done – makes kidnapping more attractive and lucrative around the world. While governments might make a distinction between proscribed and criminal groups, kidnappers don’t. And so the markets are inextricably linked.So what should governments do? If the goal is to bring the hostages home safely while reducing the threat of future kidnapping and minimise the money flowing to terrorist groups, then there are legitimate questions about whether the no-concessions policy is achieving the desired result.First, a series of studies carried out in recent years provide little evidence that kidnapping victims are targeted according to nationality. Thus refusing to pay ransom does not appear to reduce the incidence of the crime, but does greatly increase the likelihood that the victim will be killed. Perversely, in the current environment, it may actually increase the money flowing to terrorists, because kidnappers can execute their British and American hostages, who because of the no-concessions policy have little value, as means of putting pressure on the European countries that pay multi-million-dollar ransoms. This is why the problem must be defined differently and more narrowly. How can western countries work together not to stop ransom payments to terrorist kidnappers – which is an unattainable goal – but rather to minimise their size? Clearly, the K\u0026ampR industry has a key role to play.However, the benefits that security consultants provide are only available if people have access to kidnapping and ransom insurance. Governments should work with the industry to develop innovative ways to extend coverage to vulnerable groups. K\u0026ampR coverage can be tucked into travel-insurance policies or provided through employers whose staff operate internationally. For high-risk groups, such as freelance journalists and volunteer aid workers in conflict zones, the challenge is more difficult. But governments can work with the industry to develop specialised products, even if these require public subsidies.Finally, the families of kidnapping victims who lack insurance should be given access to security consultants in extraordinary circumstances, such as those with national security implications. This can be done by creating an industry-wide pro bono standard, whereby security companies increase their volunteer services. It could also be done via some sort of government pool that needy families can access if certain standards are met.When I met with representatives from the Foreign Office, I found them dug in to their view that the no-concessions policy was simply not up for discussion or debate. This is a shame, because data made available in recent years does not support its central contention, namely that refusing to pay ransom reduces the risk of future crime. Moreover, as Doug Milne notes: “By refusing to allow concessions, you drive the negotiations underground, so the intelligence you might otherwise get following the case disappears. The families feel they could potentially be prosecuted. And the government becomes the enemy.” That’s a bad outcome that does not serve the hostage, or advance Britain’s national security. It’s time to consider a new approach.Adapted from We Want to Negotiate: The Secret World of Kidnapping, Hostages, and Ransom, published by Columbia Global Reports and available to buy at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bd6796a9d30d57abc0c4b54d22c6062c07df8b4/0_95_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=881d4f1c49b46159d7bc179ac8e7bdce","title":"planning for no deal on the brexit frontline podcast","story":"With less than 10 weeks to go until Britain leaves the EU and still no withdrawal deal agreed, businesses around the country are scrabbling to prepare for the worst-case scenario of a disorderly Brexit.

The Smith version is backed by four other Labour MPs.In his article, Lavery said May had “spectacularly failed to deliver a Brexit deal that will meet the needs of our country”. He wrote: “Her attempts to revive her categorically rejected deal seem to have about the same chance of success as the kiss of life would have on the T rex exhibit at the Natural History Museum.”In parallel with Labour MPs’ manoeuvrings over a second referendum, Conservative backbenchers have been tabling amendments seeking to demonstrate their dislike of the Irish backstop, one of the main factors that led to the defeat of May’s plan.One of the key amendments on Tuesday, if selected for a vote by the Speaker, could be one tabled by the Tory MP Andrew Murrison that has attracted the support of key figures such as Graham Brady, the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, and May’s former de facto deputy Damian Green.This calls for the backstop – an indefinite insurance policy that would come into force if no permanent deal can be made to prevent a hard Irish border – to be “replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border”.While this could win over many Tory MPs who voted against the deal, and possibly also May’s DUP partners, it would require a change in the EU’s stance, which is seen as very unlikely.Asked whether more concessions from Brussels were possible, May’s spokesman indicated on Friday that some movement was needed.“I think there is a clear message from EU leaders that they want us to leave with a deal, and they understand that a deal is in the best interests of the United Kingdom and the European Union,” he said.“The prime minister put the deal as it stands before parliament, and that deal suffered a significant defeat. So clearly if we are to leave with a deal, we’re going to need to make some changes to it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25e5831fafc025f5ab27ad0f0b737a18a79d8a8e/0_860_3269_1961/master/3269.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6459612534b99ba7ced6d6feaaf6ad68","title":"4bn year old earth rock found in apollo 14 crews moon haul","story":"Scientists say rock must have been blasted to moon, buried then uncovered by asteroid impactsWhat may be one of the oldest known rocks from Earth has been found in the material that Apollo 14 astronauts brought home from the moon nearly 50 years ago.It is thought that the rock, made up of quartz, feldspar and zircon, crystallised deep beneath Earth’s surface about 4bn years ago and was catapulted towards the moon in a collision with an asteroid or comet soon afterwards.“It is an extraordinary find that helps paint a better picture of early Earth and the bombardment that modified our planet during the dawn of life,” said David Kring, a senior staff scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas.Chemical analysis of the 2g fragment suggests it formed more than 12 miles underground in an oxidising environment, which can be found on Earth but not on the moon. A major impact then excavated the rock and blasted it into space, according to a report in Earth and Planetary Science Letters.At the time of the collision, the moon was three times closer to Earth than it is today. After the rock came to rest on the lunar surface, another impact 3.9bn years ago partially melted and buried it, scientists believe.The final impact that affected the rock happened about 26m years ago when an asteroid slammed into the moon and made the Cone crater, measuring 340 metres wide and 75 metres deep, near the Apollo 14 landing site. That impact resurfaced the rock, which was then collected by the Nasa astronauts. The Apollo 14 crew spent more than 33 hours on the lunar surface in February 1971 and brought home nearly 43kg of moon rocks.The researchers, led by Jeremy Bellucci and Alexander Nemchin at the Swedish Museum of Natural History and Curtin University in Australia respectively, concede that the rock may have formed on the moon, but argue that this would have required conditions not previously seen in lunar samples. To have a lunar origin, the rock would have had to crystallise at tremendous depth where rocks tend to have very different compositions, they write.The Earth formed in the early solar system 4.5bn years ago. The oldest known fragment of Earth rock is a zircon crystal from Western Australia. The sliver of material, the same width as two human hairs, has been dated to 4.4bn years old.

She uses humour, humility and a large bag of the chewy sweets now known as Starburst to explore working-class stereotypes.Playing off 90s nostalgia and the fetishisation of the working class, she asks a member of the audience to choose clothes for her to wear, solely based on a description of her social and financial circumstances.

In Chicago, Transportation Security Administration workers have been stopping at area food pantries in uniform on their way to unpaid work, while in north Texas food pantries have said their resources have been pushed to near the breaking point. Over the weekend food banks in the Washington DC area reported being deluged.Ross also offered criticism of TSA workers who have been unable to continue to show up to work unpaid.“It’s kind of disappointing that air traffic controllers are calling in sick in pretty large numbers,” he said. Many of them cannot afford to do work for nothing, he was told by the host Andrew Ross Sorkin.“Well, remember this, they are eventually going to be paid,” Ross said. “And even if they aren’t, it’s not like it’s going to be a big hit on the economy overall.“You’re talking about 800,000 workers and while I feel sorry for the iniduals that have hardship cases, 800,000 workers, if they never got their pay, which is not the case, they will eventually get it, but if they never got it, you’re talking about a third of a percent on GDP so it’s not like it’s a gigantic number overall,” he said.Very good news for the GDP. Workers might not be so lucky. While an IOU may work for a multimillionaire, I’ll pay you eventually doesn’t tend to work when it comes to rent and groceries for working families.Ross’s comments characterized a more general response to the shutdown from the wealthy right.The White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett suggested furloughed workers were “better off” over the Christmas holiday because they were getting time off without having to use vacation days.“And then they come back and then they get their back pay, then they’re, in some sense, they’re better off,” Hassett said.Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, echoed that sacrificial sentiment and praised unpaid government workers as noble “volunteers” laboring for love of president and country.When asked how coming to work without pay for fear of being fired counted as volunteering, Kudlow, a millionaire, bristled at the question. “They do it because of their love for the country and the office of the presidency and presumably because their allegiance to President Trump …”On Monday Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, waded into the shutdown controversy, saying going over a month without pay was a “little bit of pain”.“Listen, it’s not fair to you and we all get that,” she said on the digital news network Bold TV. “But this is so much bigger than any one person. It is a little bit of pain but it’s going to be for the future of our country. And their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.”Meanwhile anger from unpaid staffers compelled to arrange travel for Mike Pompeo’s wife, Susan, for the pair’s eight-day trip to the Middle East, boiled within the state department.“This is BS. You don’t bring more people that need staffing, transportation, etc when embassy employees are working without being paid,” a source told CNN of the trip.Melania Trump too has been criticized for utilizing a military plane for a vacation to Florida just as the president blocked the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, from visiting troops in Afghanistan.Responding to Ross’s comments, Pelosi asked “Is this the ‘let them eat cake’ kind of attitude?”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f382975aaf169e0edb3020c3ef18e05fa53f5e6/932_758_3347_2008/master/3347.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7c979fa19e58b60fe6303d79ee88ddb","title":"c of e leaders rebuke political parties for stifling reconciliation after brexit vote","story":"Archbishops of Canterbury and York urge political leaders to work together in synod motionThe Church of England’s two most senior leaders have accused the UK’s main political parties of “stifling” reconciliation of social isions.The direct rebuke to political leaders comes in a special motion on the state of the nation to be considered at the C of E General Synod next month, weeks before the Brexit deadline.The motion, tabled by Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, and John Sentamu, the archbishop of York, says “social isions feel more entrenched and intractable than for many years”.It expresses concern at “the isions within the major political parties which are stifling the emergence of a hopeful and viable vision for the common good in our communities”.Dioceses and parishes should pray regularly for local MPs, members of the government and civil servants, “seeking God’s strength and wisdom for the responsibilities they bear”.The archbishops’ motion says the Christian commitment “to putting the voices of the poor and marginalised at the heart of the nation’s concerns” must be reaffirmed, and the “nation’s leaders must work together for the common good at this time of ision”.The wording does not explicitly refer to Brexit, but Welby has increasingly spoken out on his concerns about social and political isions over the issue.Earlier this month, he said a no-deal Brexit would hit the poorest and most vulnerable people in the UK, and would be “not only a political and practical failure, but a moral one”.Welby voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, but has since stressed the need for reconciliation and restraint.He told the House of Lords this month: “A second referendum is not my preference, but if parliament fails in the task entrusted to it then regrettably it may be required. This is about more than Brexit, and parliament must not show itself unfit for the job.”Sentamu also voted to remain in the EU in 2016, but last month voted for Theresa May’s deal in the House of Lords.“Permanent loss of confidence in governmental institutions always results in civil unrest and violence.”C of E officials have cleared almost two hours in the agenda of next month’s assembly of representatives of clergy, bishops and lay members of the church to debate the motion.Divisions in the country over Brexit are reflected within the church, and debate is likely to see a clash of opinions on the way forward.The four-day meeting in London is also scheduled to discuss homelessness, the environment, gambling and discrimination against Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities.The synod will also hear a report from a body examining issues around gender, identity and sexuality, including same-sex marriage. The “Living in Love and Faith” group, led by Christopher Cocksworth, the bishop of Coventry, has been considering the church’s position since June 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53ee9ab2162a79285cde5fd35da0d4ef582cab7a/0_29_1152_691/master/1152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=739db5b5ac3f621a7a03e37a69659dac","title":"egypt frustrates giulio regeni investigation three years on","story":"Italian doctoral student’s family seek truth about his torture and murder in early 2016Three years after the disappearance, torture and murder of Italian doctoral student Giulio Regeni in Cairo, Egypt is stonewalling Italy’s efforts to investigate.In November, Italian prosecutors officially named five members of Egypt’s security services as subject to investigation in the case of Regeni, who went missing on 25 January 2016 aged 28. But two months on, Egypt has barely acknowledged the development.“The Rome prosecution has done everything in our ability. The situation is one of stalemate,” chief prosecutor Giuseppe Pignatone told an Italian parliamentary body that oversees the secret service last week.Regeni disappeared after leaving his apartment in the Dokki neighbourhood of Cairo, on his way to meet friends. After a frantic search by his parents and friends, his body was found at the side of a desert highway on 4 February, showing signs of torture. His mother later said she could only identify him from “the tip of his nose”. Last year, Pignatone said he believed that Regeni was killed because of his politically sensitive research into trade unions.“We have asked justice for Regeni,” the Italian interior minister, Matteo Salvini, told a press conference on Wednesday. “Next time I’ll run for president in Egypt,” he said, implying this would be the only way to achieve this. “But I trust the Italian prosecutors, and I trust the Egyptians,” he added.Italian prosecutors’ efforts to investigate were frustrated from the start. Italy sent its own team of investigators to Cairo in January 2016, but they were forced to run a parallel investigation rather than cooperate fully with their Egyptian counterparts, who performed the initial autopsy of Regeni’s body in Egypt without any Italian officials present.Despite the friction, Italy has maintained governmental and trade relations with Egypt. Italian weapons companies were well represented at Egypt’s first defence exposition in December, including those selling small arms to Egypt’s military and police. The Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, highlighted the “outstanding partnership between Egypt and Italy” in a meeting this month with Claudio Descalzi, the CEO of the Italian energy giant Eni..In the meantime, Italian investigators have persistently pressured their Egyptian counterparts to provide much-needed information on the case. After two years of tense negotiations to obtain CCTV footage of the Cairo metro on the day Regeni disappeared, Italian prosecutors said what was provided contained “unexplained gaps”, rendering it useless. Egyptian officials blamed technical difficulties for the loss of the critical footage, and have since offered little detail about whether or how the data might be recovered.The precise nature of the torture that Regeni suffered and the location of his corpse, close to a detention facility used by Egypt’s national security agency, had long drawn suspicions internationally that members of Egypt’s security agencies were responsible for his murder. Yet at home, Egyptian officials offered a very different view. “The security services are the ones who will say who did it,” the then vice-minister of justice and forensics expert Shaaban al-Shamy told the  in 2016. Egypt later admitted that the student was under surveillance before his murder.In late November last year, angered by the lack of progress from the Egyptian side, Italian prosecutors placed five members of Egypt’s security services under investigation over Regeni’s disappearance and on suspicion of impeding the investigation.Egypt outright rejected Italy’s investigation of the officials. “Egyptian law does not recognise what is called the ‘record of suspects’,” said the country’s state information service, taking the opportunity to cast doubt on Regeni’s visa status while in Egypt.Requests for comment from Diaa Rashwan, who heads the state information service, and a spokesman for Egypt’s ministry of foreign affairs, yielded no response. After Italy’s parliament cut its relations with Egypt in November – a move that left governmental relations unchanged – Ahmed Mustafa, deputy chairman of the Egyptian parliament’s ethics committee, said that the Italians were using the Regeni investigation “as a tool of political exhortation”.Alessandra Ballerini, the Regeni family’s Italian lawyer, stated at a dramatic press conference in Rome in December that she had a list of 20 suspects, which she termed “20 names of men who should start being afraid”.“I find hard to believe that the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, was not aware of what was going on with Giulio Regeni. It’s impossible he didn’t know anything about this,” Ballerini said.The Regeni family have vowed to seek the truth about what happened to him. “Dear Giulio, they stole your life, today you would have turned 31,” his mother Paola tweeted on 15 January, his birthday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bce5393a7539bb2beb69cc6afe88da2fa4f3d55/0_64_4051_2431/master/4051.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac5ee8a94a0614730ea5aa1ea52d5703","title":"europe coming apart before our eyes say 30 top intellectuals","story":"Group of historians and writers publish manifesto warning against rise of populismLiberal values in Europe face a challenge “not seen since the 1930s”, leading intellectuals from 21 countries have said, as the UK lurches towards Brexit and nationalists look set to make sweeping gains in EU parliamentary elections.The group of 30 writers, historians and Nobel laureates declared in a manifesto published in several newspapers, including the , that Europe as an idea was “coming apart before our eyes”.“We must now will Europe or perish beneath the waves of populism,” the document reads. “We must rediscover political voluntarism or accept that resentment, hatred, and their cortege of sad passions will surround and submerge us.”They write of their regret that Europe has been “abandoned from across the Channel” – an oblique reference to the drawn-out Brexit process that has arguably brought Anglo-European relations to their lowest point since the second world war.And they say that unless efforts are made to combat a rising tide of populism, the EU elections will be “the most calamitous that we have ever known: victory for the wreckers disgrace for those who still believe in the legacy of Erasmus, Dante, Goethe, and Comenius disdain for intelligence and culture explosions of xenophobia and anti-semitism disaster”.“Abandoned from across the Channel and from across the Atlantic by the two great allies who in the previous century saved it twice from suicide vulnerable to the increasingly overt manipulations of the master of the Kremlin, Europe as an idea, as will and representation, is coming apart before our eyes,” the text reads.Signatories include the philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy, the novelists Ian McEwan and Salman Rushdie, the historian Simon Schama and the Nobel prize laureates Svetlana Alexievitch, Herta Müller, Orhan Pamuk and Elfriede Jelinek.Rushdie told the : “Europe is in greater danger now than at any time in the last 70 years, and if one believes in that idea it’s time to stand up and be counted.“In the UK, I hope parliament may yet have the courage to call for a second referendum. That could rescue the country from the calamity of Brexit and go a long way towards rescuing the EU as well.”McEwan said he had signed the manifesto because he was “very pessimistic” about the current moment, “but try to be hopeful that the zeitgeist will turn”.Pamuk said the idea of Europe was also important to non-western countries. “Without the idea of Europe, freedom, women’s rights, democracy, egalitarianism is hard to defend in my part of the world.“The historical success of Europe made it easier to defend these ideas and values which are crucial to humanity all over the world,” he said. “There is no Europe besides these values except the Europe of tourism and business. Europe is not a geography first but these ideas. This idea of Europe is under attack.”In the EU elections in May – the first that will not include Britain – most observers predict a rise in support for populist, nationalist or anti-immigration parties. Many of them have made significant gains in national elections, as the centre-right and centre-left that have traditionally dominated Europe’s postwar politics retreat.Matteo Salvini, of Italy’s far-right League, has described the vote as a straight choice between “the Europe of the elites, banks, finance, immigration and precarious work” and that of “the people and of labour”, pledging to form a Eurosceptic “Italian-Polish axis”.Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has said the elections are a chance to bid farewell “to liberal democracy”. Unlike Eurosceptics in the UK, most European counterparts do not want to leave the EU but to take it over.Leading the charge against the resurgent rightwing populists are the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. While both have been weakened by domestic problems, this week they renewed their countries’ vows of postwar friendship and warned that the lessons of their bloody past were being forgotten.EU officials in Brussels believe it is possible there will be a decisive advance for the populists and gains for pro-European parties, or at least a confusing mix of the two, leaving the populists significantly stronger, but still facing a strong, if disunited, majority of pro-European MEPs.The net result is likely to be a far more complex parliamentary make-up, delicate coalition-building, and a European parliament increasingly unable to pass legislation to deal with major challenges, such as immigration and eurozone reform.While they did not make any practical calls to action, the manifesto’s signatories said they “refuse to resign themselves to this looming catastrophe”. They counted themselves among the “too quiet” European patriots who understand that “three-quarters of a century after the defeat of fascism and 30 years after the fall of the Berlin wall, a new battle for civilisation is under way”.Despite its “mistakes, lapses, and occasional acts of cowardice”, Europe remains “the second home of every free man and woman on the planet”, they say, noting with regret the widely held but mistaken belief of their generation that “the continent would come together on its own, without our labour”.Pro-Europeans “no longer have a choice”, they say. “We must sound the alarm against the arsonists of soul and spirit that, from Paris to Rome, with stops in Barcelona, Budapest, Dresden, Vienna, or Warsaw, are playing with the fire of our freedoms.”The signatories are: Vassilis Alexakis, Svetlana Alexievitch, Anne Applebaum, Jens Christian Grøndahl, David Grossman, Agnès Heller, Elfriede Jelinek, Ismaïl Kadaré, György Konrád, Milan Kundera, Bernard-Henri Lévy, António Lobo Antunes, Claudio Magris, Ian McEwan, Herta Müller, Lyudmila Ulitskaya, Orhan Pamuk, Rob Riemen, Salman Rushdie, Fernando Savater, Roberto Saviano, Eugenio Scalfari, Simon Schama, Peter Schneider, Abdulah Sidran, Leïla Slimani, Colm Tóibín, Mario Vargas Llosa, Adam Michnik and Adam Zagajewski"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9b6c801d58b86d979654a175ce6c7e8e6d8f667/0_61_4793_2875/master/4793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc03e11a4f33db60c0c5cfd5e0faa4c4","title":"greek mps ratify macedonia name change historic vote","story":"Majority back move amid angry cries of ‘traitors’ from nationalists who oppose dealMPs in Greece have ratified a historic accord that allows the country’s northern neighbour Macedonia to change its name.In a roll-call vote, punctuated by angry cries of “traitors” from nationalists opposed to the deal, 153 MPs voted in favour of the pact.Announcing the result to rapturous applause, Nikos Voutsis, the president of the 300-seat Greek parliament, said 146 lawmakers had voted against and one had abstained.Under the agreement, the former Yugoslav republic will be renamed the Republic of North Macedonia, ending a dispute that has ided the two countries for decades. But the backlash against the plans has been fierce.“Today is a historic day,” said the leftist Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras. “Greece is safeguarding an important part of its history, its heritage of ancient Greek Macedonia. Today we are writing a new page for the Balkans.”Macedonia has already ratified the deal. “Congratulations my friend Alexi Tsipras, together with our peoples we reached a historical victory,” the Macedonian prime minister, Zoran Zaev, tweeted.Since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Greece has argued that use of the name Macedonia would unleash territorial ambitions over its own province of the same name in a part of the world where borders are prone to shifting. Concerns had been fuelled by the landlocked republic appropriating figures and symbols from ancient Greek history including the erection of a gargantuan statue with an uncanny likeness to Alexander the Great – the most famous Macedonian of all – in Skopje’s central square.For Tsipras and Zaev, adding the geographical qualifier of “north” to the state’s new name was an honourable compromise that, once accepted, could normalise ties in the otherwise volatile western Balkans. Greece had vetoed the state’s membership of both Nato and the EU since 2008 because of the name row.Friday’s vote followed a similar endorsement of the accord by the Skopje parliament earlier this month. Under the treaty, Athens also had to vote for the pact before it could pass into law.The ratification was quickly welcomed by both Nato and the European Union.Friday’s vote was “an important contribution to the stability and prosperity of the whole region”, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, tweeted. “I look forward to the future Republic of North Macedonia joining Nato.”On Thursday night, protesters in Athens railed against the accord, described as a national sellout by opponents demanding a referendum. Police fired teargas to disperse crowds as protesters waved Greek flags and chanted “Hands off, Macedonia”. A small number of people threw molotov cocktails, rocks and flares.Torrential rain and driving wind kept many protesters away on the final day of the debate. Scores of demonstrators who braved the weather conditions outside parliament chanted “traitors” as lawmakers voted inside.EU officials said the ratification had “written a new page of our common EU future”.The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU’s top diplomat and the senior official supervising the bloc’s enlargement, said it “took political courage, leadership and responsibility on all sides to resolve one of the most entrenched disputes in the region”.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c4276a69275374d3addcba6e4d92f504d9a007b/0_568_1332_799/master/1332.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a3be854d9fdbfe320df9a44341c467e","title":"i misspoke canada ambassador to china regrets saying huawei chief had strong case","story":"John McCallum admits comments about Meng Wanzhou’s extradition fight had ‘created confusion’The Canadian diplomat who came under fire for statements about American efforts to extradite the chief financial officer of Huawei has walked back his previous remarks, saying he “misspoke”.John McCallum, Canada’s ambassador in China, appeared to provide legal advice to Meng Wanzhou, who is fighting extradition to the US over fraud allegations. Saying she had a “strong case”, McCallum outlined numerous weaknesses of the legal proceedings: political interference from Donald Trump, the extraterritorial nature of the charges and the fact that Canada is not party to American sanctions against Iran.“I regret that my comments with respect to the legal proceedings of Ms Meng have created confusion. I misspoke,” McCallum said in a statement released late on Thursday afternoon. “These comments do not accurately represent my position on the issue. As the government has consistently made clear, there has been no political involvement in this process.”McCallum’s comments, made to Chinese-language media in Canada, prompted strong criticism from opposition parties – and marked a sharp departure from previous statements from top government officials, with some experts believing they represented in a change of strategy for the government.As Ottawa navigates an increasingly fractious relationship with Beijing, diplomats and elected officials have been careful to stress the independence of Canada’s judiciary and respect for the rule of law.Opposition politicians immediately seized on McCallum’s remarks. “If I were prime minister I would fire John McCallum,” said Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, during a television interview with CBC on Wednesday evening. “To have this type of comment is completely unacceptable and he needs to be held responsible for his actions.”It is not the first time Justin Trudeau has been forced to fend off criticism of McCallum for offhand remarks. Less than a year ago, McCallum created a furore after he favourably compared aspects of Canadian policy to China, at the expense of relations with the US.On Thursday, Trudeau attempted to refocus attention on the plight of two detained Canadians, rather than discuss McCallum’s future. He said: “Making a change would not help release those Canadians a day sooner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d8902df9a0b9854b5c5016e6a778fcce9ba3767/0_62_2550_1530/master/2550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f24d6e453ff859444368bac3356cdad9","title":"jeremy hunt insists on yemen talks at us summit on iran","story":"Jeremy Hunt is first senior European minister to agree to attend controversial meetingThe foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has agreed to attend a summit organised by the US in Warsaw originally billed as an alliance to confront Iranian aggression, but only on the condition that the US secretary of state hosts a meeting on Yemen on the summit’s margins.Hunt is the first senior European minister to declare that he will attend the summit, which starts on 13 February. European diplomats have been reluctant to attend, suspecting that the event is part of a US drive to undermine Europe’s support for the Iran nuclear deal signed in 2015.The EU shares Washington’s concerns about many aspects of Iranian behaviour but has been at loggerheads with the Trump administration over the US pullout from the nuclear deal and the subsequent imposition of US secondary sanctions on any firms that seek to trade with Iran or purchase its oil exports. The EU is due to publish long-delayed and technically fraught plans to circumvent US sanctions.Washington had called on ministers from 70 countries to attend the summit. Faced by the European reluctance to join a two-day event exclusively attacking Iran, US diplomats were forced to broaden the agenda to include wider issues in the Middle East.Hunt, after talks with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in Washington this week, has agreed to attend, but only on the condition that the UK, US, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia hold a meeting on the margins about Yemen. The UAE and Saudi are key backers of the government of Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who is fighting a Houthi rebellion.The meeting helps avoid a rare UK-US standoff and gives Hunt a chance to hear about the chances of salvaging a UN-sponsored ceasefire agreed in Stockholm last month.There are ever louder claims by Saudi Arabia that Houthis are ignoring the ceasefire terms. The ceasefire prevented a Saudi-sponsored assault on the port city of Hodeidah. The port is critical to the supply of aid into Yemen.The Hadi government claims to have documented more than 400 breaches of the ceasefire and wants the UN special envoy Martin Griffiths to declare that Houthis are not abiding by it.Griffiths was in Sana’a, the Houthi-held capital of Yemen, for talks this week and has been trying to agree clearer arrangements for the control of Hodeidah port and for a civilian security force to run the city. The Houthis and the Saudis have different interpretations of how the civilian force should be composed.

The battle is decisive in consolidating Protestant domination in Ireland.1782-1800: Grattan’s short-lived parliament gives legislative independence within the Crown to an Irish Parliament, albeit one consisting exclusively of members of the Protestant Ascendancy.1800: The 1798 rebellion puts paid to Grattan’s parliament. The parliament is abolished in 1800 under the Act of Union. Henceforth, Irish MPs will only sit in Westminster. For the whole of the 19th century, Irish nationalists campaign for an end to the Act of Union.1870: Isaac Butt forms the Home Rule Association which campaigns for self-government for Ireland within the United Kingdom.1882: The Irish Parliamentary Party is formed to elect MPs to the Westminster parliament with the goal of achieving home rule for Ireland. The party dominates Irish electoral politics until 1918.1886: The first Home Rule Bill is introduced into the House of Commons by British prime minister William Gladstone. The first stirrings of fierce Ulster opposition to home rule are apparent as sectarian riots hit Belfast in June after the bill is defeated. Dozens are killed. Unionist opposition coalesces to oppose home rule with the phrase “Ulster will fight and Ulster will be right”.1892: A second Home Rule Bill is passed in the House of Commons, but defeated in the House of Lords.April 1912: The Irish Parliamentary Party again holds the balance of power in Westminster. A third Home Rule Bill is introduced into the parliament. This time the power of the House of Lords to defeat it is curbed. It is due to become law in 1914.September 28th 1912: Edward Carson organises the Ulster Covenant. More than 450,000 sign a pledge to resist home rule.January 1913: The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), an armed militia opposed to home rule, is founded.November 1913: The Irish Volunteers is founded by nationalists to ensure the introduction of home rule in Ireland and as a counter-militia to the UVF.March 1914: The Curragh incident occurs. More than 50 British army officers based in Ireland indicate that they will resign their commissions rather than move against Ulster. The proposed mutiny convinces many Irish nationalists that the British cannot be trusted to implement home rule.March 1914: John Redmond concedes the “hateful expedient” of partition with the expectation that Ulster will be excluded from the initial home rule settlement though the number of counties involved has yet to be decided. He insists on it being time-limited to six years but Unionist leader Edward Carson dismisses the time limits as a “stay of execution”.April 1914: The UVF smuggle 20,000 German rifles with three million rounds of ammunition into the port of Larne.July 1914: The Buckingham Palace conference takes place between nationalist and unionist leaders over the implementation of home rule. At the same time the British cabinet pores over maps of border counties examining nationalist areas that might be included in a home rule parliament.“We sat again for an hour and a half discussing maps and figures and always getting back to that most damnable creation of the perverted ingenuity of man - the County of Tyrone,” British prime minister Herbert Asquith declares.“I have rarely felt more hopeless in any practical affair: an impasse with unspeakable consequences upon a matter which to English eyes seems inconceivably small and to Irish eyes immeasurably big. Isn’t it a real tragedy?”\u0026nbspNo agreement is reached about what parts of Ulster can be excluded from home rule. The first World War breaks out a week later.September 1914: The Home Rule Act becomes law, but is suspended for the duration of the war.April 1916: The Easter Rising occurs in Dublin. Rebels who take up arms against the British reject home rule, which would have given Ireland self-government within the United Kingdom. They want an independent Irish republic.July 1917-April 1918: The Irish Convention is called. Nationalists and unionists meet to try and decide an agreed future for Ireland, but the assembly is boycotted by Sinn Féin. The issue of customs dominates many of the early proceedings with nationalists insisting that a home rule parliament should have control of customs revenue - at that time the chief way in which governments raised taxation. This is vehemently opposed by unionists who fear tariffs and customs will cut Northern industry off from its most important market in Britain.The final report is passed by 66 votes to 34. It envisaged a home rule parliament for the whole country with safeguards for Ulster, but its implementation is bound up with the introduction of conscription in Ireland in April 1918 and is rejected. Nationalists and unionists would not meet again to discuss the future of Ireland until the Sunningdale conference of 1973.April 1918: After the death of the Irish Parliamentary Party leader John Redmond in March, his successor John Dillon leads the party out of the House of Commons in protest at the imposition of conscription in Ireland.January 1919: Sinn Féin, which wins a landslide victory in the 1918 general election, convenes the first Dáil. On the same day the War of Independence begins with the goal of securing an independent Ireland. The first Dáil and the War of Independence both envisage a united independent Ireland.September 1919: The British government struggles to enact the Home Rule Act which is now opposed by both nationalists and unionists. A committee headed by the colonial secretary and arch-unionist Walter Long is set up to examine this option. Somewhat surprisingly the committee proposes a two home rule-parliament solution, one for Ulster and the other for the rest of Ireland. This is a volte-face for unionism as they had been adamant that they wanted to remain an integral part of the United Kingdom. The committee concludes: “The sacrifice which Ulster will be called upon to make in assuming control of its own local affairs is one which the imperial government and parliament is clearly entitled to ask its people to make”.Unionist leader James Craig says he will not oppose a parliament for Ulster provided it consists of six counties with a Unionist majority rather than the nine counties of the historic province. This is to ensure a built-in unionist majority into perpetuity. Unionists reason that including the Catholic-majority provinces of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan will imperil the long-term future of Northern Ireland.Many unionists are also convinced that they cannot trust successive British governments to safeguard the separation of Ulster from the rest of Ireland and believe only a home rule parliament for Northern Ireland will suffice.December 22nd, 1919: David Lloyd George introduces the committee findings into the House of Commons. He supports the idea of two home rule parliaments for Ireland and says that if the Irish want unity, the British will not stand in their way. He also warns that the British will fight any attempts by the Irish to separate in the same way the Union fought the Confederates in the American Civil War.December 23th, 1920: The Government of Ireland Act 1920 becomes law almost exactly a year after the bill is introduced into the House of Commons. It creates two home rule parliaments and ides Ireland on a 26six county basis. Northern Ireland is created. The act is rejected by Sinn Féin which demands full independence, but Ulster unionists accept it.June 1921: Northern Ireland is created with the opening of its parliament by King George V. The king makes a conciliatory speech saying: “I appeal to all Irishmen to pause, to stretch out the hand of forbearance and conciliation, to forgive and to forget, and to join in making for the land which they love a new era of peace, contentment, and goodwill.”July 11th 1921: A truce is called between crown forces and republicans to allow for talks about the future of Ireland.December 1921: The Anglo-Irish Treaty is signed setting up the Irish Free State and copper fastening partition. The Irish Free State is created and it will have dominion status within the British empire - effectively independence. Nationalists believe partition will be a temporary issue as clause 12 of the Treaty provides for a Border Commission. Many nationalists are confident that the commission will make Northern Ireland so small as to render it unviable.January 1922: The Treaty is ratified narrowly by the Dáil. A general election in June 1922 is won mostly by pro-Treaty politicians, but it is not enough to prevent the Civil War breaking out.December 1922: The Irish Free State comes into being, making the Border an international frontier.April 1923: The Irish Free State introduces customs controls which remain until 1993 and the creation of the Single Market. These customs posts are manned with varying degrees of efficiency and smuggling becomes a way of life for many in border areas.November 1925: The Boundary Commission report is leaked to the Morning Post. Far from proposing the wholesale changes nationalists wanted, it only envisaged a modest transfer of land from Northern Ireland to the Free State. The Free State representative Eoin Mac Neill resigns. The Free State Government is panicked by the news and seeks concessions from both the British and Unionist governments. None are forthcoming, with both governments reminding their Irish counterparts that the commission was doing what it set out to do which was to look for possible territorial swaps on both sides of the Border. Eventually the impoverished Free State agrees to drop its demand for the inclusion of nationalist areas in the North in return for a debt write-off. The British agreed to cancel Ireland’s imperial debt obligation and the status quo remains.1932-1936: The Economic War between Britain and Ireland has\u0026nbspa detrimental impact on border commerce. Farmers and food producers in border regions are required to pay import duties on agricultural produce goods can only be transferred across the border at 16 customs posts. The impact is severe with cross-border trade declining by two thirds.1956-1962: The IRA’s border campaign sees the closure of many minor roads and increased security in border areas.1969-1995: The Troubles again see the closure of several minor roads and regular British army checkpoints become a feature of life particularly in south Armagh.August 1970: The Border road at Crossmaglen is closed after two RUC men are shot dead.August 1972: A bomb planted by the Provisional IRA blows up a customs post in Newry killing nine people, including the three IRA members who planted the bomb.1993: All customs posts on the island for Ireland are abolished as the EU Single Market comes into force.2006: The last British watchtower is dismantled. This effectively ends the Border as a visible entity.June 2016: The United Kingdom votes to leave the European Union.January 2017: British prime minister Theresa May says Brexit means being out of both the single market and the customs union. This means the integrity of the single market can only be maintained if there is a customs frontier between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. This means customs checks and a hard border.December 2017: The UK and the EU agree a deal with creates a “backstop”. The backstop states that, in the absence of a comprehensive trade agreement between the EU and the UK, it will ensure there will be no hard border between the North and South. In other words, in the absence of another solution for the Border, Northern Ireland will effectively remain within the EU customs union.November 2018: The UK Withdrawal Agreement is published which sets up a transitional arrangement that will be in force until December 2020. Crucially it confirms that the backstop will operate by keeping the UK in the customs union with the EU in order to avoid a hard border.January 2019: The Withdrawal Agreement is rejected by UK MPs by a vote of 432 to 202 making a no-deal Brexit more likely.January 22nd, 2019: The European Commission confirms publicly for the first time that a no-deal Brexit will lead to a hard border on the island of Ireland."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3769587.1548348781!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"many eu countries more advanced with no deal brexit legislation than ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation Heather Humphreys meeting  EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager in Dublin yesterday as preparations for Brexit intensify. Photograph: Maxwells  As the Government publishes a summary of the Brexit omnibus Bill to be put before the Oireachtas in late February, a survey of other EU countries affected by Brexit shows many are more advanced in bringing forward Brexit legislation to cater for a no-deal outcome.Many countries have already introduced legislation, which is currently before their parliaments. Some have introduced legislation to give their governments special powers to act in the case of a no-deal Brexit. The Dutch government published its omnibus Brexit legislation as far back as last November. It has two elements. The first is a general provision that allows the administration to act by government or ministerial decree when required, without the need for an act of parliament, “and to prevent chaos or an emergency”, a spokesman said. The second is a series of articles that regulate the fact that the UK would become a third country. “These articles are required both in a deal and in a no-deal scenario,” the government said. “For example: article II stipulates that UK drivers’ licences will no longer be considered as licences issued by a member state, but will be regarded as a licence issued by a third country.”France has drawn up five “ordinances”, which allow the government to make regulations which will then be ratified by parliament, a spokesman said. The first was presented to parliament this week.Spain has also drawn up a series of “decrees” which must be approved but cannot be amended by parliament. In Sweden, legislative proposals have been published to deal with some aspects of Brexit and others are being prepared. “The government offices and the interagency process have at least the last 12 months been very active – as late as this morning I participated in a three-hour meeting dealing with these questions,” said the Swedish ambassador in Dublin, Lars Wahlund.The Danish parliament has not passed any laws yet, a spokesman said, but “the government has announced its readiness to present legislation by February if necessary specifically regarding citizens’ rights”.In Finland, the prime minister’s office has requested plans for a no-deal scenario by next week. Contacts with foreign ministries and embassies in Dublin this week demonstrate that support for Ireland is widespread and firm. Virtually all the offices which responded expressed their support for Ireland, for the withdrawal agreement and the backstop. However, many were also careful to mention that in the event of a no-deal outcome, while they supported the Irish position that there should be no return to a hard border, it would also be necessary to protect the single market. “I think it is quite obvious that there has to be an EU-border somewhere,” said one ambassador. “You chose where. To protect the internal market. It might be possible to mitigate it with the creativity of the commission, but is hard to avoid altogether.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Financial Times“It was a catastrophe. You shouldn’t have done it. You really should not have done it,” declared one of Britain’s better known property investors this month before he slammed down the phone.He was responding to a request for an anonymous comment on the demise of the annual Presidents Club Charity Dinner – he had attended the final occasion at London’s Dorchester Hotel in January last year.The FT has since learned that a group of prostitutes were operating around the event, using rooms and suites upstairs at the Dorchester – although there is no suggestion the organisers were aware of such activity.“Essentially, this was a networking event, and it’s been overblown,” declared one regular attendee. “Business is all about networking, none of this MeToo crap ... We were there for the kids, we were there for the charities.“People were paying £3,000 a ticket – they didn’t need to go there to pick up girls, they could pick them up anywhere ... There was nothing sexual except temptation. It was a bunch of 45- to 75-year-old men living the dream of ‘Can I get you?’Those attending the dinner who spoke to the FT would only do so anonymously most did not respond to requests for comment. Some of their views highlighted how little attitudes have changed in certain quarters of the business elite.The charity, which each year donated to causes such as Great Ormond Street Hospital, while spending about £2,000 per head for the annual dinner, announced it was closing last January.Its trustees, led by Bruce Ritchie, of upscale lettings group Residential Land, and luxury goods specialist David Meller, have said they had no knowledge that sex workers had attended the event and had no awareness of any abuse of the women hired to attend dining tables and assist with the charity auction.The FT’s revelations triggered a fierce debate across British business and sport over whether events should be routinely adorned with scantily clad women to entertain and excite male guests.Within days of the Presidents Club announcing its closure, Formula 1 motor racing announced it was phasing out its so-called “Grid Girls” and time was called on the “Walk On Girls” regularly seen on the professional Darts circuit.But if sex was on the minds of only some of those attending the final Presidents Club dinner, numerous other guests have since admitted they found the event – described by one newspaper as a “groper’s gala” – deeply uncomfortable.One property executive who was there last year said it was “outmoded” and “odd”. “I did not feel comfortable at all.” He added that the evening felt like “one giant cock-off” – in other words an excuse for rich men to show off about their wealth. It was the first time he had been invited to the event and claimed to have spent much of the evening texting his girlfriend to say: “Oh my god – get me out of here.”Another former attendee, who went on several occasions over the past decade, said it used to be a classier evening, but seemed “pretty grim” in recent years. Some guests took prostitutes or hostesses to suites upstairs, he said.The Presidents Club dinner may have become seedier in recent years, but women who came into contact with the organisation – which was originally set up as a charity boxing night – in its earlier days recount similar stories of unpleasant behaviour, abusive practices and inappropriate touching.Gina Miller, the transparency and anti-Brexit campaigner, told the FT last year that she was asked to work as a hostess at the event when she was working as a model while at university as a mature student. Miller turned the job down when she was told about the dress code and that there was a specific desire to hire women who were “all colours of chocolate and coffee”.Another former hostess, who worked there in 2015 – the same year that comedian Jimmy Carr hosted the event – described it as “disgusting” and “super uncomfortable”.“A few of the girls at the event told me they were prostitutes. They were dressed the same as everyone else ... The men were touching the bottom of my back. They probably thought we were all escorts. It was awful – I felt tricked.”One past organiser, who also said they knew prostitutes had attended, admitted: “Lots of very high end professional dancers, models and singers were hoodwinked into doing this event. The weirdest thing was that the girls could drink and were encouraged to. That’s a no-no in the hostessing business.During the past 14 years, the Presidents Club dinner raised £7.3 million, of which just over £5 million was spent on the event, according to Charity Commission filings. With additional donations to the charity, £7.2 million was distributed to good causes.In the wake of the FT investigation, charities that previously received Presidents Club donations vowed to improve their due diligence procedures, while large companies have moved to improve standards at events they hold or are associated with.The legality of non-disclosure agreements, which many of the hostesses were made to sign without reading, is being scrutinised by the government. MPs are also considering imposing a mandatory duty on employers to prevent workplace harassment.Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which is campaigning for employers to provide greater protection against sexual harassment in the workplace, said: “The FT investigation was hugely significant. It revealed both an extreme and shocking level of sexual harassment and abuse that women were expected to tolerate simply for doing their job.” She said it also showed the sort of behaviour that occurred at events involving leading charities and “respectable” corporates.She added: “It sent the clear message that if something like this was possible then casual sexual harassment at work is normalised and just something women put up with.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019An online search for the “Bond Street Horticultural Society” yields few results – at least nothing that hints at its true nature as a regular, and secretive, dinner held at Buck’s, a gentleman’s club in London’s Mayfair that was founded 100 years ago and is best known as the home of the Buck’s Fizz cocktail.The BSH Society is the affectionate moniker for an evening known to Buck’s members in baser terms: “Nieces Night.”Several times a year, the mainly elderly membership are encouraged to invite along female guests – preferably women in their 20s, but certainly not in any way related to members by blood or family.It is a chance for all concerned to dress up for the evening. The women are rotated between dining tables, moving with each course.Some women who have attended in the past said they were thrilled by the invite. “I’ve only ever had a very fun evening at Buck’s, it’s all very light hearted and the gentlemen are all very old school and as posh as you would expect. I attended with an old boss of mine who I’m still very good friends with despite our age gap,” said one former guest. “Everyone stays and gets rather boozy on champagne and cigars on the balcony. There’s also usually a game of indoor cricket which is super fun.”Other women known to have attended were uncomfortable discussing the evening at all, but friends of former female guests said it could be an unpleasant affair. One said they were somewhat taken aback to say the least by the outdated male environment: “It’s vile.”No one from the club itself was prepared to comment. Rupert Lendrum, the club secretary, said: “I’m not going to give any detail of any nature about what goes on in this club.”Friends of club members say news of the Presidents Club exposé a year ago triggered an internal discussion about whether their own female-focused event might be an anachronism. The debate decided “No” – Nieces Night should continue. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3770388.1548430330!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"queen urges uk to find common ground as brexit deepens","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tQueen Elizabeth II has emphasised the need for Britons to come together to ‘seek out the common ground’, in what has been viewed as an appeal to overcome isions over Brexit. File photograph: Carl CourtGetty Images Queen Elizabeth has sent a delicately coded message to Britain’s factious political class over Brexit, urging lawmakers to seek common ground and grasp the big picture to resolve the crisis.With the clock ticking down to March 29th, the date set in law for Britain to leave the European Union, the United Kingdom is in the deepest political crisis in half a century as it grapples with how, or even whether, to exit the European project it joined in 1973.While the queen (92) did not mention Brexit explicitly in an annual speech to her local Women’s Institute in Norfolk, the monarch said every generation faced “fresh challenges and opportunities”.“As we look for new answers in the modern age, I for one prefer the tried-and-tested recipes, like speaking well of each other and respecting different points of view coming together to seek out the common ground and never losing sight of the bigger picture,” the queen said.Though steeped in the conventional language the queen has made her hallmark, the remarks in the context of Britain’s crisis are a signal to politicians to sort out the turmoil that has pushed the world’s fifth largest economy to the brink.Buckingham Palace declined to comment, though the British media was clear about the significance of her remarks. The Times’ headline read: “End Brexit feud, Queen tells warring politicians”.As head of state, the queen remains neutral on politics in public and is unable to vote, though ahead of the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence she made a delicately crafted plea for Scots to think carefully about their future.Britain’s minister for finance Philip Hammond welcomed the remarks from the queen, saying there was huge wisdom in the monarch’s call for the country to find common ground.“There is huge wisdom in those words and I don’t think anybody will be at all surprised to hear the queen advocating the view that in all things controversial we should seek compromise, we should seek common ground, we should seek a way forward,” Mr Hammond told BBC Radio.“That is actually what we do in this country. That is how we solve problems in this country... It’s been our enormous strength over centuries that we have been able to find compromises that bring the nation together.”The future of Brexit remains unpredictable with options ranging from a disorderly exit that would spook investors across the world to a new referendum that could reverse the process.Prime minister Theresa May is engaged in a last-ditch bid to win support for a tweaked orce deal after parliament this month crushed the original plan in the biggest defeat in modern British history.Goldman Sachs will invest less in the UK if there is a difficult or hard Brexit, chief executive officer David Solomon said.“Our headcount in the UK over the last couple of years has not gone down but it hasn’t gone up either – we have added head count ... on the continent,” Mr Solomon told the BBC in Davos.“But I would say that, over time, if this is resolved in a difficult way or a hard way, it’ll have an impact on where we invest and where we put people,” he said. –ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

A common way to cover up the messy process of (de)construction. The housing development claims to be affecting time and space, moving people into new places and better futures, fundamentally altering their existenceThe figures follow research from Lloyds Bank which showed that UK firms ramped up stockpiling in the final quarter of last year. The bank said the increase in stockpiling efforts was caused by the threat of shortages and disruption posed by Brexit. UK Finance also released data on household lending and spending in 2018. Credit card spending rose to £11bn in December, up 8.8 per cent on the same month in 2017.Eric Leenders, the trade group’s managing director for personal finance, said this rise in spending was “largely offset by increased cardholder repayments, with almost half of cards not bearing any interest at all”. “This reflects the growing trend of consumers using credit cards as a preferred payment method rather than as a means of borrowing, in order to take advantage of additional protections and value-added benefits,” he added.

He also warned that “the recovery in mortgage approvals once Brexit uncertainty has faded likely will be lacklustre”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The lender’s international trade index shows that export growth fell to its weakest level in almost three years in the fourth quarter of 2018. Exports of consumer goods held up well, Lloyds said, but the transport sector was hit by changing emissions regulations and new rules about diesel vehicles.

The UK Manufacturing PMI Index for purchases of stocks jumped up to 53.7 for the month of December, from 51.1 in the previous month. Gwynne Master, managing director and global head of trade for Lloyds Bank Global Transaction Banking, said: “We should be mindful of the impact of fluctuating trading conditions and global and domestic political uncertainty on the UK’s exporters.“Against this backdrop of challenging conditions, it’s encouraging to see international demand for UK consumer goods sustain the longest period of manufacturing export order growth since the financial crash, even if the pace of growth has weakened.”She said the findings highlighted how important it is for companies to deal with a erse range of markets. “Exporting to a mixture of different countries would help, for example, a business offset the impact of a Chinese downturn if they were also exposed to the Netherlands, Ireland or Spain, which are all showing real strength,” she said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This flow of new money into financial markets had the effect of re-inflating asset prices, which had collapsed during the financial crisis, and increasing liquidity in order to get banks lending again.\u0026nbspThe problem was that rather than using this new money to lend productively, banks predominantly stuck to the easy-profit route of bidding up property prices. In an ultra-low interest rate environment financial firms have also engaged in ever-riskier lending in the pursuit of higher yields. The result is reinflated asset bubbles and collateralised loan obligations to over-indebted companies, which echo the subprime lending behind the last crisis.QE also had dramatic implications for inequality. All of this new money flooding into financial markets pushed up asset prices, meaning a big payoff for their wealthy owners. The Bank of England, which has created £445bn through QE, estimates that its policies made the top 10 per cent\u0026nbspof households wealthier by £350,000 each. Meanwhile, the asset-poor were left with little more than the fairytale of trickle down economics.The billionaires of Davos are a painful symptom of inequalityThe rise of ‘pauper’s funerals’ is a sad reminder of UK inequalityBoE should wind down its balance sheet early, says Ian McCaffertyGeorge Osborne says the Bank of England\u0027s QE makes the rich richerAll this is not to say that central bankers should have kept their hands clean. Central banks were forced to ramp up monetary policy as politicians shied away from their responsibilities to manage the economy with appropriate fiscal policy, instead opting to counter-intuitively cut for growth\u0026nbspthrough austerity. With central bankers limited by time and by mandate, the first round of QE can be seen as a ‘necessary evil’ - doing nothing would have only deepened the recession.But there should be no such excuses when the next downturn arrives. Further attempts to stimulate the economy through QE-fuelled asset price inflation will have diminishing returns, only creating more bubbles and further widening inequality.A sustainable recovery will only come from policies which stimulate demand in the real economy. This is something which QE could be redesigned for.Central banks’ power to create new money, as demonstrated by QE, is a powerful tool that must be put to much better uses.\u0026nbspThis is an idea which has been put on the table in the UK. In the US rising Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and in France Nicolas Hulot, who resigned from Macron’s government, are also displaying the bold thinking required with their calls for a Green New Deal a massive programme of spending on green jobs and infrastructure, which could be financed by central bank money creation.But Green New Deals and other alternatives to QE will be most effective if there is an element of coordination between countries. Firstly, on a technical level, for any country other than the United States, creating vast sums of new money while foreign central banks keep a tight monetary policy could lead to unwanted pressure on their currency.But perhaps more importantly, the problems facing humanity, from climate change to spectacular inequality, are not limited to one country and cannot be solved by one country alone.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A common way to cover up the messy process of (de)construction. The housing development claims to be affecting time and space, moving people into new places and better futures, fundamentally altering their existenceThe figures follow research from Lloyds Bank which showed that UK firms ramped up stockpiling in the final quarter of last year. The bank said the increase in stockpiling efforts was caused by the threat of shortages and disruption posed by Brexit. UK Finance also released data on household lending and spending in 2018. Credit card spending rose to £11bn in December, up 8.8 per cent on the same month in 2017.Eric Leenders, the trade group’s managing director for personal finance, said this rise in spending was “largely offset by increased cardholder repayments, with almost half of cards not bearing any interest at all”. “This reflects the growing trend of consumers using credit cards as a preferred payment method rather than as a means of borrowing, in order to take advantage of additional protections and value-added benefits,” he added.

The lender’s international trade index shows that export growth fell to its weakest level in almost three years in the fourth quarter of 2018. Exports of consumer goods held up well, Lloyds said, but the transport sector was hit by changing emissions regulations and new rules about diesel vehicles.

The UK Manufacturing PMI Index for purchases of stocks jumped up to 53.7 for the month of December, from 51.1 in the previous month. Gwynne Master, managing director and global head of trade for Lloyds Bank Global Transaction Banking, said: “We should be mindful of the impact of fluctuating trading conditions and global and domestic political uncertainty on the UK’s exporters.“Against this backdrop of challenging conditions, it’s encouraging to see international demand for UK consumer goods sustain the longest period of manufacturing export order growth since the financial crash, even if the pace of growth has weakened.”She said the findings highlighted how important it is for companies to deal with a erse range of markets. “Exporting to a mixture of different countries would help, for example, a business offset the impact of a Chinese downturn if they were also exposed to the Netherlands, Ireland or Spain, which are all showing real strength,” she said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It looked to be a straight-forward victory for the Spaniard as he surged into a two-set lead, but Murray is not a three-time Grand Slam champion for nothing and he supremely levelled the match despite hobbling around the court from the get-go. However, in the end his hip injury just took too much out of him, and Bautista Agut clinched a breath-taking 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (4-7), 2-6 victory to reach the second round where he\u0027ll face Australia\u0027s John MillmanBritish Prime Minister, Theresa May and her husband Philip attend Sunday morning prayers at her local church in Maidenhead, Britain, 13 January 2019.

Currently WhatsApp users are not required to provide their name or any other identifying information beyond their phone number to use the messaging app.Merging with Facebook Messenger and Instagram could force WhatsApp users to reveal information about themselves that they would prefer to keep private.Data privacy expert Tim Mackey, who works at the software firm Synopsys, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspthat Facebook should take considerable care in how the integration is handled given the firm\u0027s spotty history with user privacy.Merging personal information and privacy configurations from three significant applications won’t be trivial. Facebook development teams would do well to look at this precedent and prioritise user privacy, he said.\u0026nbspWith the integration project currently expected to take a year to complete, and with end-to-end encryption as part of the plan, we should expect the Facebook engineering teams to focus attention on uniform data security both in their platform and in the apps themselves.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

WhatsApp years ago started sharing data with Facebook, and the founders of both WhatsApp and Instagram have left the company in recent months amid suggestions they were concerned about their apps being subsumed into the parent company.Mark Zuckerberg hopes the decision will make each of the apps more useful, according to the original\u0026nbspNew York Times\u0026nbspreport. That in turn should make people engage with them more – and potentially encourage them to stop using rivals, like Apple\u0027s iMessage.“We want to build the best messaging experiences we can and people want messaging to be fast, simple, reliable and private, a Facebook spokesperon said.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks. As you would expect, there is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work.”In short, Facebook believes the combined infrastructure will make the apps better, and therefore more likely to be used that, in turn, will help generate more of the data and advertising opportunities that Facebook relies on to make its money. But there might be other less obvious reasons to bring the three together, as well.Until now, the apps have been kept separate, and so the data they each collect has been partly compartmentalised too.People have also been able to share different data with the companies themselves. WhatsApp only requires a phone number for people to use it, allowing them to stay relatively anonymous if they wish on Facebook, people have to use their real name and are asked to give over far more personal information.Many people choose to share more on WhatsApp or even entirely forego Facebook, because the latter has always had a more lax approach to people\u0027s personal data. WhatsApp has repeatedly stressed how important it is safeguard people\u0027s privacy – but that was largely led by its founders, who have left the company, and is thought to be getting eroded as it is subsumed by Facebook.\u0026nbspIn short, the move could be a concern for anyone who prefers to keep their data separate – and away from Facebook. The sense of having some contacts, information or messages safe on WhatsApp and away from its owner, or vice versa, will be lost.It\u0027s possible that same data will be used for advertising, and there have already been rumours about WhatsApp using information for marketing or showing ads within the app itself. No final decision on how the integrated services will be monetised has been decided yet, the\u0026nbspNew York Times\u0026nbspreported.Regulators are likely to share those concerns, and it\u0027s almost certain there will be yet more questions about whether Facebook should be more restrained than it is now.Facebook is still in the early stages of the work, according to the reports. But the plan is set to be finished by the end of this year or the beginning of 2020.As with most Facebook projects, the rollout will probably be small at the beginning and gradually take place across users. It\u0027s likely that such a major update will be made available to a small number of beta testers initially before being added in stages.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anger over poor social conditions grew so intense that it provoked a riot in the late 1990s. A local social activist who objected to youths smashing bottles on the road and handed a bin bag full of broken glass to the mother of one of those responsible\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbsphe had bricks thrown at his house and firecrackers pushed through the letterbox.Outside Westminster, people are becoming numb to the Brexit crisisWhat turned Thanington round was substantial aid from the European Union.Paul Todd, a former resident who works on housing and homelessness issues, says:\u0026nbsp“About 20 years ago it was regenerated when it got a large dose of money out of the European regeneration budget.” The funding was used to make extensive renovations such as putting new roofs on the council houses and renewing bathrooms and bedrooms so the homes of council tenants looked better than those privately owned. In addition, the\u0026nbspregeneration money funded a community centre, known locally as the Resource Centre, which provides space for sports and recreation, as well as accommodation for children doing homework which they could not do at home.Paula Spencer, who has managed the centre since it was built, adds that the EU “spent £2.5m in doing up the estate and getting rid of the rat-runs. It used to be that they would nick your video machine and disappear down an alleyway.” Crime and antisocial behaviour dropped by 50 per cent as the regeneration measures took effect. As a newly arrived council tenant, Heggie says that she had been worried by the crossbow bolt incident but “apart from one broken car window on my driveway I have had no trouble since”.Created with Sketch.

A police officer speaks with anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayPolice surround a pro-Brexit protester after he confronted a pro-European protester Conservative MP David Davies, wearing a gopro camera, speaks to anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayThe EU intervention enabled Thanington – which I previously featured in the first instalment of this series – to lose its nickname of “Little Beirut”, but its residents complain that they have lacked public investment ever since, and that this is beginning to show. The 2,794 people who live there work mostly in low-wage jobs, often as cleaners or in supermarkets in and around Canterbury, or they are on benefits. Educational standards are low, illiteracy is high, and many single-parent families are headed by women. Nevertheless, residents and outside observers agree that Thanington retains a strong sense of communal solidarity.“It’s largely retained its village identity,” says Todd, whose relatives still live there and who has great affection for its people. “Everyone knows everyone else’s business.”\u0026nbspOver the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant. Then there was the shootingThe only state institution to help preserve this small and vulnerable community was the EU, so it is worth asking why so many of those living in Thanington voted Leave\u0026nbspin the 2016 referendum. At first glance, their actions, repeated in many deprived areas receiving EU funds in England and Wales, appear to be an inexplicable example of social and economic self-harm. Nevertheless, it was probably the high Leave\u0026nbspvotes in deprived white housing estates which tipped the balance towards Britain voting for Brexit. So it is important to discover why people from such places voted as they did in such overwhelming numbers. Was it a vote very much determined by opposition to immigration, or was it a more general protest by the “left-behinds”\u0026nbspand the “left-outs”? \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMost people in Thanington voted for Britain to leave the EU, and they did so because they are poor and feel neglected, according to Todd, who has known the area for 30 years. He says that there is an “assumption there that immigration has affected their prospects. I don’t think people are aware of how much Thanington did benefit from the EU. The European regeneration money certainly made a huge impact on the quality of the housing stock up there. It probably gave some of the houses another chance, otherwise they might have been knocked down. Some people want immigration cut and others think that talk of another referendum is an indicator that their concerns haven’t been taken seriously.”Bellas did not mention and may not have known about the EU regeneration effort which happened before he started living on the estate after years of homelessness and holding insecure jobs. In any case, the impact of that funding is running out and there are signs of growing decrepitude and insecurity.\u0026nbsp“It’s quite a deprived area,” he says. “There’s a lot of people with drug problems and\u0026nbspalcohol issues, and they seem to be moving families in who have already been evicted from homes because of antisocial behaviour. Everyone’s got a right to live anywhere but it doesn’t do great things for the estate.“Over the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant – ‘you’re going to sell this for us’\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa lot of guys in Mercedes,\u0026nbspreal high-end saloons,\u0026nbspwho don’t fit on the estate. Then there was the shooting in the summer, which was a direct result of these guys coming down from London and that happened just around the corner from us.”Created with Sketch.

Only the sleeping bag is left as a sign of what might have been“It’s a lack of funding and a lack of police. You only ever see police when these things happen and it’s after the fact. Our kids don’t play out on the street. I know all my neighbours and I know all their kids, but it’s really difficult because there are people from off the estate come to sell their drugs that I don’t know. We had a heroin dealer set up in the house next door to us and for about six weeks, we had people knocking on our door coming to pick up their drugs up and it took 50 phone calls to the police to get them to sort it out.”The shooting Bellas refers to took place on 19 July last year when\u0026nbsptwo men in balaclavas shot and seriously wounded Danny Mobey in Thanington’s Godwin Road.Bellas voted Leave in the referendum, denying that this had anything to do with immigration and saying that his decision was more to do with democracy and resistance to power being devolved to a centralised European government and unelected officials making decisions on his behalf. He says: “I just feel that there is something quite sinister and secret about a federal government.”About the economic consequences of departure from the EU, he is optimistic, arguing that the Germans, French and Spanish will want to go on selling goods to Britain. He says that a lot of people he knows had voted Leave influenced by “the Brexiteers’ promise that there would be £350m\u0026nbspextra for the NHS”.\u0026nbspHis two biggest concerns are the lack of policing and the decline of the NHS, where his wife works as a nurse, and which he fears the government wants to privatise.Even in a place as small as Thanington, perceptions of violence vary markedly from street to street and person to person. Di Hutchinson agrees that things are getting worse: “I was ill last Christmas and I saw a drug deal going down and I was shocked because it was the first time I’d ever seen it.” Overall, however, residents and outside observers say that Thanington is no worse than other housing estates and other areas of deprivation anywhere in UK. (There are more affluent parts of the district away from the estate.)People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhereFinancial aid from the EU and other advantages stemming from membership had little effect on poor Leave voters in 2016. Either the EU’s achievements were under-publicised, or – and this is probably the crucial factor – whatever the EU did was not enough to counterbalance a pervasive sense among millions of voters that their lives are getting more pressured and insecure. This was as true in east Kent as it was in Cornwall, an example of ingratitude for EU largesse often cited. That county has a population of 530,000 and received €654m\u0026nbsp(£574m) from the EU between 2007 and 2013. It was due to receive another €600m before 2020, yet 54.5 per cent voted Leave.Fear of immigration was probably the most important factor in the way people voted, but so too was the privatisation and outsourcing of utitlities and services, job insecurity, decline in real wages, high rents, deindustrialisation and a lack of cheap transport. The EU and its supporters can justly complain that Brussels is being unfairly scapegoated for failings that it has\u0026nbspnothing to do with, and which\u0026nbspshould be blamed rather on globalisation, privatisation and the austerity policies pursued by Conservative governments.Yet, even if the EU is not responsible, this does not mean that the deep discontent\u0026nbsprevealed by the referendum result is\u0026nbspnot real. Simply put, Brexit is a symptom as well as a cause of the crisis which has enveloped Britain and envenomed its politics. The ill-considered Remain slogan of 2016 – “Better Together” –\u0026nbspwas never going to resonate with those whose standard of living had stagnated or deteriorated over the past decade despite Britain being in the EU. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAusterity may have driven homelessness rise, minister admitsTransport is already scarce: according to Spencer, it takes two bus trips to get to the nearest doctor, while there is only one bus every two hours in the evening. A planned new exit from the A2, which is being contested by local residents, will make Thanington even more isolated from the rest of Canterbury than it is at present. And as houses become more expensive and cost far more than the present population on their low-paying jobs can afford, the traditional community will break up as parents find that their children have to move off the estate if they want find anywhere cheap enough to live.Even more seriously, the insecure low-paid work done by many in Thanington does not provide enough to pay rent and food. The result is reliance on food banks and free school meals. Caroline Heggie says that people are becoming more and more indebted “because now you’ve got companies giving out credit cards to people with low credit ratings”.A telling sign of the growing deprivation in Thanington – and the sort of event which may explain why people there failed to endorse the status quo in 2016 – is a recent plague of rats.“People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhere,” says Spencer. The origin of the rat infestation is unclear: it may be that rats were disturbed by the new housing construction in nearby fields, or that the council no longer deals with rubbish that has been left to pile up. Cuts in public services of all kinds have hit Thanington hard, and services dropped include pest control.A rat catcher charges £60, which tenants must now pay themselves though there may be 10 or 12 rats to be disposed of, necessitating more than one visit.\u0026nbspHeggie says: “You used to have council ‘rat people’, but because of austerity, you don’t have them anymore.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 10. The Life of Emile ZolaPrestige counts at the Oscars. That is why a stodgy literary biopic like The Life of Emile Zola somehow won the main award at the 1937 Oscars. It’s a solid and worthy piece of work, with a grandstanding performance from Paul Muni (under a lot of whiskers) as the campaigning French novelist. The idea, though, that it is one of the “few truly great pictures of all time”, as its own publicity suggested, is clearly idiotic.It may seem churlish to go after an underdog like Rocky but this was an undeserving Best Picture winner. The Academy voters in 1976 acted as if they were punch drunk and had spent too long in the ring with Apollo Creed. The problem with its victory wasn’t so much the film itself but with the other nominees that were spurned in its favour. Taxi Driver, All the President’s Men and Network all surely had a better claim to that year’s statuette.310 8. Around the World in 80 DaysThis was a perfectly amiable big-budget travelogue but you can’t help but suspect its Best Picture Oscar was more to do with the marketing and hustling skills of its producer, Mike Todd, than with any brilliance in the filmmaking. It was directed by the Englishman Michael Anderson, previously best known for The Dam Busters, and featured David Niven as the intrepid traveller, Phileas Fogg, who bets he can travel all the way round the world in a little over two months.Paul Haggis’s Crash is a decent and well-meaning study of the consequences of racism and violence in contemporary LA. It was independently made and had a large ensemble cast, all giving heartfelt performances. However, Robert Altman had covered similar territory better in Short Cuts and the feeling persisted that it had won the Best Picture award because some Academy voters were determined not to give the Oscar to the gay-themed contemporary western Brokeback Mountain.You rarely win an Oscar without a strong marketing campaign. The now disgraced distributorproducer Harvey Weinstein knew the secrets of getting Academy voters on his side better than anyone else in the business. Whether it was the Blitz-like approach to advertising in the trade press, or the timing of the awards screenings, or the way he kept the film’s stars in front of the media or his relentless courtship of the Academy members, he was arguably as important to the Oscar success of the so-so musical Chicago as any of the creative talent behind it.It’s not bad. It’s a love story that touches on mental illness and mathematics (neither usually subjects that Hollywood embraces). Russell Crowe gives a fine performance as John Nash, the Nobel prize-winning boffin with the beautiful but unstable mind. Nonetheless, Ron Howard’s biopic isn’t any kind of classic. It won its Best Picture Oscar in an unusually thin year.Marty, the 1955 winner, isn’t even the best version of its own subject matter. This story, scripted by the great Paddy Chayevsky, about an emotionally repressed Italian American butcher from the Bronx looking for love, had already been made as a live TV drama the year before. In the small-screen version, Rod Steiger gave a superlative performance in the lead role. Ernest Borgnine in the film version can’t help but seem like second best to anyone who saw Steiger in the same part. Whereas the puggish Borgnine makes Marty a figure of pity, Steiger turned him into a full blown tragic hero.810 3. Out of AfricaYou’ll remember the pink flamingos and all those scenes of beautiful Kenyan landscapes that looked as if they were cribbed from a David Attenborough natural history documentary. You won’t ever forget Meryl Streep’s eccentric accent as the Danish baroness and author, Karen Blixen (“I had a farm in Africa at the foot of the Ngong hills”). This is mushy stuff, though, and hardly deserving of its Oscar.This rousing, Scottish-set (but partly Irish-filmed) medieval epic is famous for its scenes of William Wallace’s army in blue faces lifting their kilts and baring their bums. Regardless of how accurate this was as history, it played into ongoing debates about devolution and Scottish independence. The film also did its bit for the Scottish tourism business. Mel Gibson knows how to stage a battle scene. Whether that qualifies his film for a Best Picture Oscar is another matter.1010 1. The Greatest Show on EarthFrom a vantage point 67 years on, the decision to give the Best Picture Oscar to Cecil B DeMille’s circus epic in 1952 is truly baffling. British viewers who have seen it will almost certainly have done so on TV (where its 152-minute running time made it useful for filling in gaps in the schedule). It has a decent cast and some reasonable stunts but Academy voters were surely clowning around when they chose it over other nominees in the same year which have aged far, far better like High Noon and The Quiet Man.110 10.

It has a decent cast and some reasonable stunts but Academy voters were surely clowning around when they chose it over other nominees in the same year which have aged far, far better like High Noon and The Quiet Man.It’s currently looking unlikely, although there have been instances where the Academy president has decided to revoke nominations after they were announced. However, these have all been due to rule-breaking technicalities that rendered them ineligible for the award they were nominated for.The first time this ever happened was at the first ever Oscars ceremony in 1928. The voting board didn’t want Charlie Chaplin – who was nominated four times for The Circus – to sweep the board so stripped him of them all and gave him an Honorary Award instead.Another instance of a rescinded nomination arrived In 1954 when John Wayne film\u0026nbspHondo\u0026nbspwas nominated for Best Story. It was\u0026nbspdisqualified after the Academy\u0026nbspdiscovered that the script was based on a short story called The Gift of Cochise.Director of controversial James Bulger film apologises to familyIn 2010, a 25-minute Norwegian short film titled Tuba Atlantic had its nomination for Best Live Action Short Film revoked after it was discovered it had aired on television before its theatrical releasAnother film whose Oscar nomination came under fire was short film Detainment, which depicts the\u0026nbspmurder of two-year-old James Bulger after he was abducted from a shopping centre by Robert Thompson and Jon Venables when they were 10.Bulger’s mother, Denise Fergus, called upon Irish director Vincent Lambe to remove his film from contention – something he has since said he won’t do.Singer was fired from Bohemian Rhapsody after failing to turn up to set.

Nevertheless, Japan’s decision to quit the IWC and resume whaling provoked a storm of protest.“Australia remains resolutely opposed to all forms of commercial and so-called ‘scientific’ whaling,” the country’s environment minister, Melissa Price, and foreign minister, Marise Payne, said in a statement.Created with Sketch.Troubled waters: Did we really save the whale? Show all 2Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sam Annesley, executive director at Greenpeace Japan, added:\u0026nbsp“The government of Japan must urgently act to conserve marine ecosystems, rather than resume commercial whaling.\u0026nbspThe declaration today is out of step with the international community, let alone the protection needed to safeguard the future of our oceans and these majestic creatures.”A number of\u0026nbspcelebrities and environmentalists including\u0026nbspRicky Gervais, Joanna Lumley, Chris Packham, Stephen Fry and Ben Fogle have\u0026nbspsigned an open letter to the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, attacking the decision to begin whaling again.“To the utter disgust of the rest of the world, Japan intends to resume killing whales,” it said.\u0026nbsp“We don’t need statements of disgust, we need sanctions that will hurt. If shame won’t turn the Japanese then economic pain might.”\u0026nbspA march on the Japanese embassy in London has been planned for\u0026nbspSaturday.Japan argues\u0026nbspthe IWC has\u0026nbspbeen taken over by conservationists opposed to any form of whale hunting and was no longer working to simply manage global whale stocks.By resuming commercial whaling, the Pacific nation joins Iceland and Norway in ignoring the\u0026nbspban on whaling.But some experts have suggested the decision may even benefit whale populations.As well as resuming commercial whale hunts inside its waters, Japan\u0026nbspannounced it would cease its controversial scientific whale expeditions in Antarctica.For years Japanese scientists caught thousands of whales a year, selling the meat after research had been completed. Critics claimed the scientific hunts were simply a cover to allow Japan to continue whaling for food.Marine ecologists told Science magazine earlier this month\u0026nbspthat given the declining appetite for whalemeat in Japan, the commercial hunts in its coastal waters would probably be small in scale, whereas ending the yearly battles over Japan’s scientific expeditions would free up the IWC to focus on conservation.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

three separate attempts to\u0026nbspredraft leader’s strategy so it\u0026nbspties party unambiguously to giving UK a second voteClick to followIndy PoliticsJeremy Corbyn faces a revolt from Labour MPs backing a new Brexit referendum, who will launch a drive to rewrite his proposals for the next phase of withdrawal.The move from three MPs to redraft his strategy, so it ties Labour unambiguously to giving Britain a Final Say referendum, once again thrusts the party’s deep Brexit isions into the spotlight.Hours earlier four other Labour MPs had joined Tory counterparts at a press conference, with one accusing Mr Corbyn of “standing in the way” of a people’s vote.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWhile Mr Corbyn’s office declined to comment on Thursday, the leader’s social media outriders launched a counter-attack on the Labour rebels whom they accused of dishonesty.Meanwhile doubt has emerged over the viability of a cross-party push by MPs to delay the UK’s withdrawal in order to avoid leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March.No-deal Brexit would be ‘betrayal’ of what was promised, says HammondAnd in Davos, chancellor Philip Hammond warned that a no-deal Brexit – something Theresa May has refused to rule out – would be a “betrayal” of the 2016 referendum result, underlining the split\u0026nbspat the heart of the Conservative cabinet.On Tuesday Ms May will give a statement and table a motion setting out the next steps of her Brexit plan, but because of previous measures approved in the Commons, all MPs will also be able to table amendments containing proposals for what they think the government should do next.Mr Corbyn has already submitted the Labour Party’s amendment, but it disappointed many backers of the People’s Vote campaign for a fresh referendum because it failed to fully commit the party to backing one.It would require ministers\u0026nbspto find time for MPs\u0026nbsponly to “consider and vote on options” including renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and also then “legislating to hold a public vote” on any deal that successfully passes through the Commons.But The Independent understands three Labour MPs – Ian Murray, Angela Smith and Mike Gapes – have now taken the unusual step of tabling amendments to their own party leader’s amendment, in a bid to remould Mr Corbyn’s approach so it backs a new vote immediately.Mr Murray’s would commit the government to holding a referendum offering a choice between a Brexit deal that guarantees “full participation in the single market”, as previously promised by Labour, and remaining in the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote:

opportunity to have a final say” on leaving the EU, while Ms Smith’s would see ministers legislate for a vote on “whether or not the UK should leave”.The Independent has run its own Final Say campaign to try and secure a new referendum, with more than 1.1 million people having signed the petition.While neither Mr Corbyn’s amendment, nor the three amendments to it, stand much chance of being passed in\u0026nbspthe Commons, the joint push from Labour MPs speaks to a growing frustration on the party’s backbenchers over the ambiguity of the leader’s position as the Brexit clock ticks down to 29 March.At an event on the steps of parliament earlier in the day Labour and Tory MPs announced they would not table a cross-party amendment for a second referendum because it stood no chance of passing the Commons without Mr Corbyn’s support.Is Brexit causing hundreds of companies to leave the UK?Ford warns no-deal Brexit would cost it $800m this year, report says Jeremy Corbyn, help give the British people a Final Say over BrexitLuciana Berger\u0026nbspsaid: “Regrettably the Labour leadership won’t commit to an achievable policy and yet we know that the majority of Labour voters, supporters and members want a final say on any Brexit deal.“Yet at a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.”She added: “There are millions of young people in our country that supported the Labour Party at the last general election. Over two million of them were under the age of 18 in 2016. They would today now have a vote. And so many whom I speak to cannot understand why Labour is standing in the way of the younger generation having a say on this.”Chuka Umunna, who was also at the event, argued that party politics should take a back seat, saying: “The choice is stark and there is no way of escaping from it or postponing making a decision because we are out of time – do you want to facilitate some form of Brexit or give people the power to stop it?”\u0026nbspMeanwhile,\u0026nbspChris Leslie told The Independent: “There really isn’t any excuse now for Labour not fulfilling the conference promise for a people’s vote. An election hasn’t been triggered, so we should be at that stage now.”Polling indicates Labour voters and members are in favour of a new vote, but the leadership has had to walk a fine line with many constituencies in heartland areas having heavily backed Brexit.A separate group of Labour MPs strongly oppose a new referendum, including frontbencher Melanie Onn, who wrote to her constituents saying she would quit her role in Mr Corbyn’s top team if the leadership did back a new vote.Following the event in the morning Corbyn-backing commentator Paul Mason said the intervention was “daft”, and accused the Labour rebels of “preparing a doomed centrist party”.Columnist Owen Jones argued that a second referendum amendment would not get through because Labour MPs in Leave seats and Tory MPs would oppose it.He added, addressing Mr Umunna on Twitter: “You either don’t know the facts or you’re being dishonest. Which is it?”The amendment that seems most likely to get thorough the Commons on Tuesday is that written by Labour’s Yvette Cooper, with cross-party backing, that seeks to extend Article 50, delaying Brexit to avoid a no-deal scenario.But concerns have emerged that legislation it requires to enact its aim\u0026nbspcould get bogged down and even blocked outright in the House of Lords.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Election commission officials discovered the ruse, Mr Quraishi said, because they attended the event and realised there was no bride or groom present.Modi’s ruling party suffers big defeat in key India pollsWorld\u0027s largest gathering of people begins in IndiaIndia moves to open up job quotas to upper castes for first timeHindu women are proving religion and equality can go hand in handTrump mocks Indian prime minister over library in AfghanistanIn another case, Mr Quraishi described party activists stuffing daily newspapers with banknotes as incentives for voters. He said officials found the circulation of the paper increased four-fold.“We set up an expenditure monitoring ision, we started tracing money, but the commission can only do so much when the parties are always one step ahead,” Mr Quraishi told a panel at the Jaipur Literature Festival in Rajasthan. “The parties kept organising fake weddings, they just rented a fake bride and groom as well.“Whether you are being offered saris or gold, the response has to come from you, the voters, that you will not accept these bribes. Even if they are knocking down your door with offers, you must go out and vote with a clear conscience.”Mr Quraishi took issue with the government of Narendra Modi for introducing the concept of “anonymous election bonds” at its last budget, where donors’ names are kept secret, and for removing a cap on the amount businesses can donate to political parties.India has long had an issue with election candidates paying their way to power.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a bid for power without a mandate.Shty Dominic Grieve fancies himself as a Remain superhero, outwitting the Government to rob .million voters.He doesn’t give a damn about the little people, of course, being a grand QC and former Attorney General.But Grieve is doing catastrophic harm to his party, to Parliament and our democracy. History won’t be kind to him.The Government he is destabilising is the only prayer Leavers have.Their betrayal by Labour is close, and inevitable.Labour’s Brexit chief Keir Starmer now admits that he aims to secure a second referendum — then campaign, and vote, for Remain.If that’s not Corbyn’s policy, why isn’t Starmer fired All the chaos brings Theresa May ever closer to an election.One in which every Tory Remainer plotting to kill Brexit must be deselected and replaced.With candidates who stay loyal to voters and make promises they intend to keep.SADIQ Khan’s “poll tax” on drivers looks like the biggest disaster of his inglorious tenure as London Mayor.We know he is a lightweight who prefers virtue-signalling to fixing the city’s problems. But this insane pollution charge could prove fatal to his prospects.Not only is his scheme, to hammer drivers in his Ultra Low Emissions Zone, vastly expensive to set up, it will barely improve air quality. All those who cannot replace their old car with a “cleaner” new model will be clobbered.Which of course hits the lowest-paid hardest. And, naturally, other left-wing councils nationwide are following suit.How very “progressive” it all is.NO ONE expects a flag-waving jamboree on the th anniversary of troops being deployed to Northern Ireland. But why would the MoD not mark it at all It is a snub of a piece with the hounding of veterans over their actions decades ago.It stems from a corrosive political correctness in modern politicians’ attitudes towards our role in the Troubles, where , troops died quelling the IRA’s campaign of slaughter.Labour may be led by pensioner revolutionaries who supported the terrorists.That’s no reason for the Tories to forget who the good guys were — and their bravery in securing the peace.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m voluntarily withdrawing from their process.DANCING On Ice viewers can’t say they weren’t warned.“After the break,” said host Phillip Schofield, “Gemma Collins is Marilyn Monroe. Don’t go away.”A big ask. But then so’s stling a fit of the giggles when Richard Blackwood describes himself as “the king of cool”, and trying to look at Ryan Side-bottom’s Beauty and the Beast make-up without thinking of Terry Waite chained to a radiator in the Lebanon.The Gemmasaurus, though, performed at least three television miracles at Sunday’s Musicals-themed night.The first was being hoisted into the DOI rafters, on  board a giant ring, within  seconds, by the same team who got the London Eye upright.The second involved claiming the moral high ground, from Jason Gardiner, during a spectacular toddler tantrum at the end of her Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend routine.And the third, but biggest of all, was somehow getting voted through to next week’s show despite re-writing the entire history of musicals. Gentlemen, it transpires, no longer prefer blondes.They can’t  stand them, in fact.QUIZ show doughballs of the week. The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The Burger And The King is a documentary about which singer’s eating habits ”Gianluca: “Billie Jean King.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “If I meow, what animal am I ”Poppy: “A goat.”Celebrity Mastermind, John Humphrys: “In an  poem, what season of the year does Keats describe as ‘the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness’ ”Monty Panesar: “Oliver Twist.”Joe Lycett: “The fictional Champion the Wonder Horse is actually a what ”Ben: “A zebra.”. THIS Morning handover of the week. Holly Willoughby: “Love against the odds is the subject of the phone-in today. Vanessa Feltz, what kind of calls are you hoping for today ”“We’re looking for calls from people who think their love is against the odds.”And that’s why it’s about to win a National Television Award for the ninth year in a row. ANOTHER week brings another incompatible pair of reality TV gimps, with an E title that also sounds suspiciously like their viewing figures.Spencer, Vogue and Baby Too, a fly-on-the-wall documentary, about Matthews and Williams of that ilk, which is based  on the classic misapprehension of every first-time parent: The world is simply full of people who give the slightest toss about their newborn.It’s not. Nor is anyone listening when they bang on about the “tiredness, sleepless nights and blah blah blah”.The only reason I kept watching this one, in fact, was to try to establish exactly how Spencer and Vogue earn a living, as they’re one of those independently wealthy couples who give very little clue as to why they’re always so “busy, busy, busy”.It took a couple of episodes, but eventually Vogue muttered some- thing about her own fake tan range and Spencer said something even less convincing about cooking, before adding: “We bring dferent things to the table.” The urge Spencer really wants to milk, it turns out though, is a creative one. So, at the climax of episode two he’s striding into London’s Soho Theatre for an audition, with the defiant announcement: “I’m going to open or shut the door on my childhood dream of becoming an actor.”And how’s that going Make sure it bangs your a*** on the way out, Spencer.TV GOLD: The Paras: Men Of War, on ITV. BBC’s Revolution In Ruins: The Hugo Chavez Story detailing exactly how socialism, with Jeremy Corbyn’s connivance, destroyed Venezuela, the most oil-rich country in South America.Sky Atlantic repeating series one of The Sopranos. And Jeremy Kyle’s captions offering us: “My deceased mother told me on the way to Peter Andre that my dad is my step-dad.” A family trauma so painful, it could not cease until he’d closed the set with Mysterious Girl.GREAT Sporting Insights.

Ah, oui, Dominique. Not as British as you might think, Grieve.Which may explain why he  is now doing such terrible damage to our national interest and to the future of our parliamentary system by trying to block Brexit. Over the two decades since he became an MP in , this pukka, posh-suited, punctilious figure has been a pedantic regular in House of Commons debates.He would crook one of his little fingers at an angle, give his neck muscles a creaky tweak and insist, with a shot of the cuffs and a shuffle of minimal notes, that ministers and officials must always comply with statute and precedent and time-honoured procedure.When giving these lectures — they were seldom short — he would touch the rim of his glasses, give a little mallard-style cough and allow a patronising smile to inhabit his broadening bill.He would explain that raw political instinct and passion, of the sort voiced by the Nigel Farages and Jeremy Corbyns of this world,  were not by themselves good enough in politics. He looked down on such things.Politicians whose demagogic brio reflected the public’s molten anger  Puh-lease, how vulgar. They did not accord with Grieve’s gods of logic.“With respect,” he would say — and it is one of the older truths of Westminster that when people say “with respect” they mean the sneery opposite — “with respect, we have to do things according to the rules, for that is the way this Parliament works and those are the sort of people we are.”I paraphrase him but that was very much Grieve’s position. He was a creature of propriety.He could cite legal sub-section and addendum and annex and codicil that proved, we were told, the unarguable merits of his position.With Monsieur half-French Grieve, the ancient principles of English law were our majesty. Our mainstay!Plenty of us clocked that Grieve was a bit of a prune, an oddball, the fogeyish son of privilege. His dad Percy, wouldn’t you know it, had also been a Tory MP of the gusset-and-sock-suspenders old school.Percy once worked as a liaison officer for French wartime hero Charles de Gaulle, who hated the British . It was said that Old Man Grieve agreed with de Gaulle.“The trouble with Percy  is that he likes foreigners  a great deal better than his own people,” concluded an acquaintance.Dominic, in childhood, worshipped his father and once won a school oratory contest by making an admiring speech about de Gaulle.Does “Dominique”, too, like continentals better than his fellow countrymen  It sure looks that way. In June , in one of the greatest thumpings our elite was ever given by the people, we voted to leave the EU. Dominic Grieve, newly decorated with France’s Legion d’honneur for his political work, was horried.Indignant. You could even say he was ag-Grieved. And so he touched the rims of his glasses, did some ducky quacking and set to work to block Brexit.The trouble, as has often been pointed out to him, was that the democratic vote had gone against him.At first he said, through gritted teeth , that he would respect the result of the referendum.In  he was re-elected as MP for prosperous Beaconsfield, Bucks,  on a Tory manesto which said exactly that.Every Tory MP promised to get us out of the customs union and single market.Labour MPs also promised to honour the referendum result. What lying bastards these people are. When the new Government started to get into political dficulties, the once-principled Grieve saw his chance. He stopped saying he would respect the referendum result. He wanted us to stay in the customs union. He wanted a second referendum.Most startling of all, he plotted to bypass all those rules and time-honoured procedures he used to say were so vital for our political safety.After a secret meeting with the appallingly biased John Bercow, Grieve got that anti-Brexit Commons Speaker to chuck out centuries of accepted debating rules.Propriety was smashed like plates at a Greek wedding. Legal advice was ignored.This former Attorney General’s campaign against Brexit, which will next week see him and a minority of MPs attempt to remove law-making from the elected Government, took on a wild, crazed aspect.The possible upshots for our democratic system are terrying. When MPs stop even bothering to pretend they will honour their election promises, why should anyone vote Why not just seize power by force  It’s a recipe for anarchy on the streets.At the moment, Corbyn’s Labour Party is going along with Grieve and Bercow but Corbyn will surely eventually realise that warping parliamentary rules to stop an elected Government from governing will do him no favourshe himself becomes Prime Minister.  It always takes time for the penny to drop with dozy Corbyn.Meanwhile, we are left  with the bizarre spectacle of one-time legal details nerd Dominic Grieve going back  on everything he ever stood for, overturning ancient parliamentary conventions.All along, it seems, his loyalties were not to a rules-based system but to the blue flag of a European Union that is now, increasingly, our rival and our deadly threat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A new political party, which represents what a lot of us want.Because you’ve got to say — the parties in Westminster aren’t doing that, are they Whatever happens at the end of this awful Brexit mess, one thing is clear, our politics have to change.The isions between our current parties no longer reflect the isions in the country. If Brexit has told us anything, it’s told us that.And there is a growing anger out there that the views of millions and millions of people are simply not represented in Parliament.That’s obvious from Brexit — more than a third of Labour voters wanted us to leave. Including a majority in some northern constituencies. Almost two thirds of Tory voters wanted us to leave.Nigel Farage, the former leader of Ukip, has already said he fancies creating a new party. A Brexit Party.Good luck to the man — I might even join it, because I have the horrible feeling our Parliament is going to betray the people, and we’ll end up staying in. That would be a travesty of democracy.The very reasons which convinced more than million of us to vote for Brexit were the same as those which are causing isions across Europe. And as a result we’ve seen the huge rise of populist parties. In Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Greece, France and even Germany. Oh — and, of course — the USA.These parties are sometimes right wing, sometimes left wing. In Italy there is an alliance between the two.What they are all, though, is dferent to the politics we have now. They are parties which listen to the people. Populist is just another way of saying popular, really.Most agree on a whole bunch of issues. We need to control immigration, number one. Especially immigration from Islamic countries.We need a bit more respect for the nation state: People feel proud of the countries in which they live. Yes, even some Belgians.A lot are socially conservative. By which I mean they do not have much time for gender neutral toilets, LGBTQI protests, political correctness and so on.Instead, they have a respect for traditional values. For the family, for the Christian faith, on which our countries were founded. For our histories. And they are sceptical of the European Union.But they also recognise that there are deep economic isions within our countries which need to be addressed. In our own country a terrible chasm between the affluence and influence of London, versus the rest of the country. Between rich and poor.We have no political party right now which covers those bases.But that is where the real ide in society lies. So, as January drags on — how about a party  One that represents US Labour MP Diane Abbott thinks that the BBC Question Time programme discriminated against her because she is:a blackAbbott got a rough ride and the audience spent most of the time laughing at her or booing.Diane, listen. It’s not your skin colour. It’s not your gender.It’s something  altogether.We are used to politicians speaking down to us.And we are used to politicians being thick.But when both occur at the same time, that’s when the rest of us decide we’ve had enough.Stuff the BBC won’t tell you.Number One – The International Monetary Fund has admitted it got its projections wrong.The UK economy is not stagnating. Economic growth for the next year will be every bit as strong as in France and Germany.And meanwhile all the other indicators – investment, employment, growth in wages – are MUCH better than those in the European Union.Someone tell Huw Edwards.Yet again I’ve accepted a Facebook friend request from a woman without checkingshe’s a proper woman, rather than a porno sock-puppet.Sure enough, within the minute, I was invited to view intimate photographs of the lady.And she ended her invitation with the words: “Slap my frog, cowboy!”Why would I want to slap her frog  I hope her frog has a long and happy le. And why am I a cowboyTheres nothing funnier than slebs making idiots of themselves while politically grandstanding.Gary Lineker, for example, does it every week. His intellect is about as radiant as a candle flame in an aircraft hangar. But he still gives it large, ranting about Brexit. And praising Europe’s worst leader, France’s Emmanuel Macron.The latest slebs to fall foul are the Spice Girls. They posed for photos in “edgy”T-shirts reading: Gender Justice. Now it’s been revealed those shirts were made in a workshop by women who are paid p per hour.There’s gender justice for you.The memorial to Bomber Command in London’s Hyde Park has been defaced by scumbags.They threw paint over the sculpture – and also vandalised statues of Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Our pilots in World War Two won a battle against all the odds to protect this country from fascism. More than , of them died doing so.The filth who vandalised the memorial know nothing of that. Nothing of personal sacrice, of hardship, of discipline.And they know nothing of history, full stop.What kind of people are we raising in this country So, huge congratulations to Ant McPartlin.The perpetually smirking Geordie munchkin won “best presenter” at the National Television Awards, despite not having been on television for a year.People have criticised the decision, but I’m all in favour.Andhe promises to stay off the screens for another  months, I’d give him next year’s award, tooDid you see the shots of the babes turning up for the National Television Awards I call them babes because it was minus ten or something out there. And they rolled up to stand on the red carpet outside in flimsy dresses slit from ankle to lady garden.

And Ms Truss will claim Labour’s own pollsters are worried that young voters in towns and cities are the “least loyal” to Mr Corbyn.The Cabinet Minister will say: “Young people are going off Jeremy Corbyn even faster than his own MPs are. This is the most self-starting, business minded generation ever, and all Corbyn offers is high taxes and more state control.“Conservatives have cut taxes and made it easier to start a business. It’s Conservatives not Labour that will help young people fulfil their ambition and turbocharge the economy as we leave the EU.”The intervention comes just weeks after the Treasury’s secretary hinted she believed HS should be scrapped so billions could be invested where.She has told allies Britain needs to spend much more on faster web connections across all corners of Britain. So far the Government has only committed to promises million full fibre connections by .And Ms Truss will say the Government has to be far more radical in shaking up planning rules in housing so “young people have the chance to live near the best jobs.The state is not always the answer to modern problems – and it’s precisely the opposite of what the new generation want.”Some  per cent of  to  year-olds voted for Jeremy Corbyn in the  Election. A surge in turnout among the younger generation - the so-called ‘Youthquake’ - was cited as the reason for Labour’s strong showing in last year’s General Election.Labour’s share of the youth vote did increase, but its popularity also went up among all ages except for the over s.I’m in Leeds today to talk to young people about the future of the UK beyond Brexit. Because after March, the people with the most to gain are Britain’s under-s. This is the breakthrough generation – and I want to listen to them, writes Liz Truss.This generation – the first to have grown up on the internet, more connected and more enterprising than any that came before – are best equipped to enjoy the freedom that comes with leaving the EU. As we bring power back from Brussels to the streets of Britain, they are raring to go.There is a lot of latent potential to tap in to: the latest data shows that the UK now has % more - year old entrepreneurs than in . That’s because they have more tools to succeed than ever – like the internet and smartphones. Seeing their heroes on YouTube rack up more viewers than primetime TV, or an app developed by a teenager change an entire industry, has given Gen Z the bug for success – and they’re only just getting started.Recently I met a group of young entrepreneurs under  years old. Their energy was infectious, and they had two tips for us in government: make the rules simpler, and break down barriers for under-s to set up enterprises.We now have an army of high achievers brimming with ambition, and with the drive to shape their own futures. We’re told by Labour that they’re all sandal-wearing Corbynistas, but this couldn’t be further from the truth.Research shows the young are more interested in making money than older generations and are less likely to support higher taxes. And it’s Conservatives, not the red-flag-waving Marxists, that are helping them succeed. Barriers to entry into business have never been lower thanks to our reforms and tax cuts, meaning anyone with a bright idea can start an empire from their bedroom.This is also the first generation benefitting from our school reforms, with tougher exams preparing students for the dynamic modern economy. Like Brampton Manor Academy – the state school in East London that recently had  children accepted to Oxbridge. Far from snowflakes, we’re raising a generation who refuse to be put in their place and who are shaking things up.These young people are the future of Britain, and we have to ensure Brexit works for them. Too often in this country our instinct is to be too defensive, sacricing opportunities to preserve what we have. The danger is that it leads to state subsidies and regulation propping up industries and preventing new, fresh ideas from taking off. We must not fall into that trap.An obvious example is housing, where we have reviewed planning rules and provided additional infrastructure funding so that more young people have the chance to live near the best jobs. And we should turn up the heat of competition, so that new building companies can take on the big corporations who stand in the way of change.We need to keep an eye on regulation. We need to ensure standards, while allowing iniduals and businesses to be independent, embrace risk and reward, and enjoy all the benefits that come with it.And we should solve our modern challenges – like fibre connectivity– with more competition and new firms delivering cheaper, better ways forward, not politicians taking control and leaving no choice when things go wrong.This is exactly the opposite of what Labour are offering. They areanimated by one core belief: that the state knows best and should control more of our lives. If only Jeremy Corbyn were put in charge of trains, water or the internet – goes the argument – we’d all be living in utopia.The state is not always the answer to our modern problems – and it’s precisely the opposite of what the new generation want. They want to be free, not shackled by stling regulation which is good at keeping order, but not so good at delivering a dynamic and exciting economy.So we can appeal by expanding opportunities, taking on vested interests and showing we don’t want to ban any of the good bits of modern le. By doing so, not only will we generate the growth so vital for rising wages and living standards, but also convince a new generation that Conservative values are theirs.With the Prime Minister’s approach to Brexit, this is the path we are on, and I would encourage all my colleagues in parliament to back her in securing a deal so we honour the vote of the British people and leave the EU in a way which benefits every part of our country.We will leave the European Union in March, and step out into a new world with confidence and optimism, and a new generation of entrepreneurs driving Britain to keep defying the predictions.

Therefore the appeal is dismissed.The incident occurred on July  last year after Grimshaw - who was a full time carer to her father before he was admitted to a care home - was staying over at her sisters home with her young daughter and started drinking.During the evening, she rang her daughter’s father to come and pick up the child but an argument broke out when Grimshaws sister said she was drunk and asked her to leave. At around .pm a police patrol got a tip off about an incident in the area and found Grimshaws vehicle blocking the street.In mitigation her lawyer Charlotte Johnson said: “She is the main driver and both her father and her daughter will be impacted from the driving ban. She has suffered bouts of depression throughout her le, one episode was when she split up with her ex partner and another was when her father become ill. She received medication and is still receiving medication now.“She understands the aggravated feature of having a child present. Her most signicant mitigation is her personal mitigation. The ban will affect not only her, but her father and her daughter for a considerable period of time. She feels the magistrates did not fully take account of her personal mitigation.”Chair of the bench Richard Rigby told Grimshaw: This was an extremely high reading and you are aware of what can occur from drink-driving.

Campaigners demanded action from the Department for Work and Pensionsto close the loophole after it was branded bizarre and unfair. The problem hits council and social housing tenants who pay rent once a week.Many will make  rent payments in   because the financial year has  Mondays. Yet they are due the same amount of Universal Credit asthey paid  weeks, because the six-in-one benefit is calculated dferently.DWP officials insisted today there are no plans to change the system because it would be too complicated. But Catherine Ryder, Head of Policy at the National Housing Federation, told the Mirror: It’s a really serious situation. This whole mess is entirely avoidable. Ministers have to act now to sort it out. Labour MP Ruth George, who has raised the issue face-to-face with DWP chief Amber Rudd, added: Having  weeks of rent in a year is an anomaly of the system, it’s not anyone’s fault.So to refuse to compensate tenants on Universal Credit is a bizarre decision that will leave claimants even more out of pocket.The problem, raised by the NHF and first reported by Inside Housing, is expected to affect Universal Credit claimants who pay weekly rent once every six years.The NHF says that because UC is paid monthly, it is calculated using a formula that effectively takes  of a claimants weekly rent payments and ides the total by . But there are  weeks plus one day in each year. That means every six years or so, a tenant has to make  rent payments, not .   Housing associations say the issue will come to a head in   because rent day is usually Monday, and the year has  Mondays. Rochdale Boroughwide Housing expects , tenants to lose out by an average of pound each, while Bolton at Home expects , to lose out by pound each. The NHF, which represents housing associations, says the majority of claimants have their entire rent paid by UC, while others receive a contribution towards it. That means the majority of those affected are set to lose out on a weeks worth of rent, according to the NHF. Ms Ryder said: “To solve this, the Government only needs to make a small change – but it’s one that will help hundreds of thousands of people across the country. Otherwise, people will lose out and possibly end up falling behind with their rent.  Last month Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd told MPs the issue was one of quite a few bugs in the system and said: We will address itand I will come back to you on it. But today DWP officials claimed change would be complicated and lead to confusion and said the average cost over six years was p a week. A spokesman said: A key principle of Universal Credit is that it simplies the benefit system and the Department has no plans to amend the regulations for assessing housing costs. “Some social housing providers have moved to charging new tenants on a monthly basis to overcome any challenges on the rare occasion a  week charging year may occur.” "},{"url":null,"title":"what queens secret brexit message","story":"NewsAnalysisWhat the Queens secret Brexit message really means - or doesnt mean at allStop everything!

So weve taken what she said, line by line, and worked out how it could relate to our political crisis... or simply making jam.

Brexiteers also see it as an opportunity to strike trade deals around the world. HOW ITS NOT ABOUT BREXIT: The Womens Institute is battling the generational challenge of shedding its fusty Jam and Jerusalem image to attract modern members. More members mean an opportunity to make more jam, which is incredibly important.Tried and tested recipes WHAT SHE SAID: As we look for new answers in the modern age, I for one prefer the tried and tested recipes...HOW ITS DEFINITELY ABOUT BREXIT:Weve enjoyed frictionless trade with the European Union for decades, and % of all UK exports went there in . As we look for new answers of how to implement Brexit, why ruin something thats tried and tested just to make a political point  HOW ITS NOT ABOUT BREXIT: Jam is facing a dangerous threat in the modern age.

Meanwhile the political left trade angry jibes on Twitter about the way forward over Brexit. Everyone should just calm down and be nicer to each other. HOW ITS NOT ABOUT BREXIT: The Womens Institute may look friendly, but that hides its brutal inner politics. Last year the Hampshire WI accused headquarters of contempt over the distribution of subscription fees. We must not allow our dferences to tear apart all that is sacred and good about the WI.Seek out the common ground WHAT SHE SAID: ..ing together to seek out the common ground...HOW ITS DEFINITELY ABOUT BREXIT:I, the Queen, am breaking centuries of tradition and calling on MPs to back cross-party amendments over Brexit. Tories and Labour alike are coming together to seek out common ground over the way forward - which probably will include delaying the  March date of Brexit. This is a good thing.

Distressing CCTV shows a mother pushing a young child across the road in Parsons Green, West London, yesterday. The road is clear as the woman starts to cross, but a car comes into picture as they approach the other side of the road. The car then knocks the stroller from the mothers hands and sends it flying across the road. The panicked woman then rushes to the aid of her child. Shortly after she appears to speak to the motorist who then drives away. A witnesses said the baby appeared to be unhurt and the woman walked away from the scene.  They told The Sun: When you first saw it you thought Oh my God and feared the worst. It seemed inexplicable that the driver wouldnt have seen them but he drove straight into the pushchair. The mum seemed sure the baby was fine and had a brief talk with the driver before they went their separate ways. It was unbelievable. Another onlooker added: Its a busy, dangerous crossing and theres been a few other bits of crime in the area so we had the CCTV camera installed.   You can see it could have been far, far worse but luckily the baby was fine. politan Police were not aware of the incident.

Shortly before, the grieving youngster had asked a family member whether mummy would be attending the heartbreaking occasion. After being told I dont think so, she replied: Because shes so sad  In response, the relative said: Yeah. Aaliyahs brave mum, Nikki Yule, has been left at breaking point following the murder of her son in Gillingham, Kent, in October .  Kyle was just  when he was punched, stamped on, and stabbed to death by a gang of five youths who attacked him like vultures. The horric killing, which was triggered by a stolen bike, followed several violent clashes between two gangs of teenage boys. Kyle was later laid to rest at an emotional funeral. And in tear-jerking scenes aired in a one-off Channel  documentary this week, Aaliyah was filmed scattering her big brothers ashes. The footage, from A Year of British Murder, shows the little girl standing on some grass, surrounded by loved ones holding balloons.  A woman beside her then addresses the crowd, saying It means a lot to Nikki that all of you are here, before breaking down in sobs. She adds through her tears: Thank you all for coming. The woman then opens a plastic container containing Kyles ashes, before his younger sister reaches in, takes some and scatters them. Aliyah later says to her dad: Daddy look on the floor, its Kyles ashes. And in another heartwrenching moment, she innocently tells her childhood friend: Dont step on Kyle! Why you stepping on Kyle  Speaking in the documentary, Nikki, who is so proud of her little girl, explains how the youngster believes her brother is Peter Pan.  Cos that was the last words he ever said to her, she says. He said: I live forever, or something. She adds: Ive got the boiler in my bedroom upstairs. So when someone goes in the bathroom it makes a loud noise. And she thought it was Kyle, she still thinks hes in the house. Following her sons murder, the mum is filled with immense anger.I think about him more now than I probably did before, Nikki says in the documentary, which is available to watch via Cs on demand site. Ive got so much anger in me, I just feel like Im on breaking point. Kyle died on the operating table at Kents Medway Maritime Hospital after suffering a fatal wound to a major artery in his right armpit. Victor Maibvisira, , from Gillingham, Ephrain Akinwunmi-Streets, , from Sittingbourne, Kent, Tyler Ralph, also  and from Stevenage in Hertfordshire, Shezakia Daley, , from Gillingham, and Jordan Dania, , from Croydon, south London, all denied murdering the teen. However, they were convicted by a jury at Maidstone Crown Court.  Jurors had been told how Kyle was heard screaming for help, and for his mum, as he was surrounded and viciously attacked with a machete. Courageous Nikki attended the eight-week-long proceedings. Her sons killers were jailed for le, with Maibvisiral, who caused the fatal injury, given the longest minimum term of  years.

The bone does not appear to be a result of recent trauma and had no skin or other particles surrounding it.

A Primark spokesman said: Primark clearly takes this matter very seriously and has already carried out an investigation at our suppliers factory where the socks were made. No evidence of any kind exists to suggest that any incident has occurred in the factory, so it is highly probable that this object was placed in the socks by an inidual for unknown reasons.

The pairs relationship has been under some strain in recent months following a number of frosty public engagements. Princess Diana biographer Robert Jobson says Prince Charles knocked heads together over Christmas in a bid to halt the disagreements between the Duchesses. He told Sunrise earlier this week: I think there’s no smoke without fire. I do think it has been blown up a little bit but there have obviously been a few problems between the two ladies and even between the two princes. There’s some truth in the rumours. I’m sure at Christmas Prince Charles was knocking heads together and you can see that by those photographs of them all walking together in a line. But they looked like they had been pushed together in a line, to be honest.   Meghan and Harry appeared happy and releaxed alongside Kate, Prince William and the rest of the Royal Family during a Christmas service at St Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham. The couples laughed and joked as they greeted a crowd which had gathered to catch a glimpse of the royals outside the church. Jobson also dismissed suggestions that the Meghan had chosen another hospital to snub the royals. He said: They’re going to be down in Frogmore Cottage , which is near Windsor so they’re going to be out of town anyway.   This is actually whereSophie Wessexhad her babies and I think they’re quite skilled in older mums. Sophie was quite late having her babies –  or  I think – and then you’ve got Meghan who’s going to be . I think it’s best to be in a national health hospital where they’ve got all the facilities and all of the emergency units. Meghan has opted for NHS Frimley Park hospital to give birth while Kate has given birth to all her three children in the exclusive Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington.  The private wing of the NHS hospital is also where Princess Diana gave birth to both Princes William and Harry. And the maternity ward is fit for royalty, with art installations, luxury toiletries and chef-made gourmet food - including afternoon tea. Often likened to a five-star hotel, new parents can even order a glass of champagne to toast their baby’s arrival.

Last October, Grimshaw was disqualied from driving until  and fined pound by magistrates in Tameside, Greater Manchester. But now, the single mother has complained about theof her driving ban, demanding that she get back on the roads sooner.   She said the -month ban should be less than what it is because her -year old daughter was due to enrol at secondary school in September - and would have to board a bus or tram to get there. She argued that she was the main driver in her family, and that a y disqualication would impact on her, her daughter and her father, who is currently in a care home. Grimshaw, of Chadderton, near Oldham, Greater Manchester, urged an appeal judge to reduce the road ban - but he rejected her plea. He even suggested magistrates had been soft on her. Judge Mark Savill, himself sitting with two JPs, ruled: This was a very serious offence and in all circumstances the magistrates could have been more severe with their penalty against the appellant.  In all circumstances we feel she was offered considerable leniency in her sentence and therefore we decline to alter the disqualication ban of  months. Therefore the appeal is dismissed. The incident occurred on July  last year after Grimshaw, who was staying over at her sisters home with her daughter, started drinking. During the evening, she rang her daughters father to pick up the child but an argument broke out with her sister, who asked her to leave. At around .pm, police got a tip-off about an incident in the area, and found Grimshaws vehicle blocking the street. It is not clear why her niece was in the car. Joshua Bowler, prosecuting, said: Officers were on duty when they spotted a blue Peugeot , with a female in the drivers seat attempting to reverse parallel park.  They spoke to her and asked her to wind her window down. They noted there was a strong smell of intoxicants, her eyes were glazed and her eyes were bloodshot. She was arrested and cautioned and taken to Central Park police station where she was made subject of two breath tests. Officers also confirmed there was a young girl aged either nine or ten sat in the passenger seat, and she was confirmed to be the appellants niece. Tests showed Grimshaw, who was a full-time carer to her father before he was admitted to a care home, had  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath. The legal limit is mg. She was later found guilty of drink-driving. She had denied the charge, claiming she was not driving the vehicle and had been making phone calls from the drivers seat.   In addition to her road ban, the former cashier was fined pound with pound in costs and surcharges, and ordered to complete a community order for  months with rehabilitation activity requirements. Her lawyer Charlotte Johnson said: I accept this was a very high reading and was in the presence of a child. The appellant accepts the aggravated features of the high amount of alcohol in the blood and the feature of the child being present - but she states she travelled a very short distance. Theof that ban will have an effect on her father. In  her father had to have a knee replacement, before that he wasnt able to walk, and had to live at her address. As a result of this she was looking after her -year-old daughter and her father, she had to give up work. The appellant did all the driving on her own. She drive him food shopping, to doctors appointment etc.  This continued until her father was moved into a care home. Even after moving into the care home, Miss Grimshaw still helped with things like food shopping and doctors appointments. She also lives with her -year-old daughter who is due to start secondary school next year. The lawyer added: She is asking to think of the impact upon her daughter. Her daughter will have to get trams and buses to the school and will cause ious issues. She is the main driver and both her father and her daughter will be impacted from the driving ban. She has suffered bouts of depression throughout her le, one episode was when she split up with her ex partner and another was when her father become ill. She received medication and is still receiving medication now. She understands the aggravated feature of having a child present. Her most signicant mitigation is her personal mitigation. The ban will affect not only her, but her father and her daughter for a considerable period of time. She feels the magistrates did not fully take account of her personal mitigation.

Mercedes Hoblin was in her third year in the care industry when she decided to make a dramatic career change in October last year. The -year-old mum, from Boreham, Essex, extracts beans - or build-ups of smegma - from the tips of horses penises for pound per animal. Its a dirty job, but someone has to do it - and Mercedes, who has has owned horses for years, told Essex Live she has never really minded cleaning their nether regions to keep them healthy. Its a task that is often overlooked or not done regularly enough by owners of a gelding, a neutered male horse. Mercedes got her start by extracting beans - hardened masses of dirt and grime - from her own horses and others at her stables between  and . WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES   She then made it her business, charging pound per horse or pound per horse for a group of at least four. She said: It was quite a job change, none of my friends and family are horsey but I have owned horses for years and I never really minded cleaning that area of them. She added: My friend said it is a niche in the market and that I should do it full time so I started a Facebook page and now it is my full-time job.   I started doing it on my own horses and other horse owners at my yard asked me to do it on theirs and it just stemmed from there really. Now I can just pop them out. I did some research about vets finding these beans but it wasnt until I did it myself that I couldnt believe the size of them. They can be gigantic. She said: Most of my friends thought it was a bit of a joke at first, they are a bit grossed out by it all but they cannot believe how [my business] has taken off. Everyone I have been to say they are shocked at what I can find. I have been to clients that overly clean the area and it causes problems. I want people to be more aware of the problems these beans can cause because it can be dangerous for your horseleft untreated. She said a shop museum called Curiosities from the th Corner, in Battlesbridge, has approached her and expressed an interest in displaying some of the biggest beans she has collected.  The shop doubles as a museum and shows off macabre wonders from around the world. Mercedes said: The museum got in touch with my via my Facebook page and askedI kept my beans. I usually chuck them away but he askedI could keep some so he could put them in a display jar. He is still working out how to preserve them. Mercedes, who owns three horses, wears plastic gloves when she removes beans from the urethral fossa, which is just above the urethra, the tube which urine passes through. If they arent removed, they could block or impede the flow of urine, which could lead to infections and kidney problems. Mercedes travels around Essex and as far away as Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, and Herefordshire She said: People call me for all sorts or reasons. Sometimes it will be because their horse is misbehaving, other times it may be because their horse cannot wee properly. I have even had horse owners come to me because they think their horse might have colic.  Lots of flies around the area in summer can also indicate a problem. People dont want to pay for a vet to come out because they are so expensive so they often call me instead and eight out of ten times the horse will have a bean. When I first started I thoughtI can do about four a week it would be good but now I do around four or five a day. It usually takes about  to  minutes to clean a horses genitals. Mercedes said: First I use a gel and a spray to clean the area. It does depend on what type of dirt it is. Some horses are cleaner than others, it all depends on how the horses are kept, likethey live outside they will be dirtier than those kept in. I always wear gloves when I do it, and I just use a sponge and hot water. The first level is the shaft pocket, I then use my hands to go further up to the horses penis. I just feel around it andthere is a big bean I can feel it straight away. They are like rocks which can cause lots of problems for horses. They can be more than three inches longtheyre that big I have to try and break them down with my hands because it can be quite painful and uncomfortable for the horses.

However one couple found themselves being publicly humiliated recently when they were told just that and escorted off an American Airlines flight because of it. According to Yossi Adler and his we Jennie, staff at Miami International Airport booted them, and their -month-old baby daughter, off a plane telling them that they werent allowed back on due to their bad body odour. Mr Adler, a -year-old business consultant, is adamant that they didnt smell and claims his family were kicked off because they are Jewish.   The family were preparing to fly from Miami to their home in Detroit on Wednesday, when the incident occured. But their plans fell through when passengers complained they smelled bad. Speaking to WPLG Local  News, Mr Adler said: All of a sudden, as soon as they took us off, they closed the gate and then they said, Sorry sir, some people complained you had body odour and were not letting you back on. His we claims they were so confused about the whole thing, they stopped people in the airport to find out whether they did in fact smell.   After being kicked off the plane, the family say they were told their luggage would be ed to them, but that didnt happen and they were left with just the clothes on their back. Everything they needed to look after their child, including a car seat and stroller, were left on the plane. In a statement, American Airlines said: Mr Adler and his we were removed from the flight when several passengers complained about their body odour. They have been booked into a hotel for the night and given meal vouchers. They have been rebooked on a flight Thursday.   Despite this, Mr Adler has accused the airline of targeting his family because theyre Jewish. In a video showing the father speaking heatedly to airport staff after being kicked off the plane, he can be heard saying: Theres a religious reason for some reason that theyre kicking me off the plane.

That rival had burns so bad from an iron his T-shirt was stuck to his skin when he was presented to the Sinaloa cartel boss, who left him to decompose alive for days before he was killed, it is alleged. Guzman tortured two other men by beating them with a stick like rag dolls for hours before shooting them dead and ordering their bodies to be incinerated, the bodyguard claims.   Isaias Valdez Rios, in jail in the US since his arrest on drug trafficking charges in , told jurors in New York he watched his boss - the former head of the Sinaloa cartel - carry out the gruesome murders. It was the first time the federal court heard about killings allegedly carried out by Guzman himself, rather than underlings following his orders. The court heard Valdez, , is a former member of the Mexican armys special forces who began working for Guzman at one of his mountain hideouts around . Valdez claimed Guzman shot a member of the rival Arellano-Felix cartel, or the Tijuana cartel, after he was abducted in .   The man was severely tortured with a hot iron and suffered burns so bad “the T-shirt he was wearing was stuck to his skin and he had lighter marks all over his body, Valdez told the jury. El Chapo, who has been supported in the gallery by his we, Emma Coronel Aispuro, left the badly injured and blindfolded man outdoors for three days, interrogated him for  minutes and then threw him in a hen house for several more days. The cartel boss underlings began to complain about the bad odour coming from the hen house, where the rival was decomposing in a way, said Valdez.On Guzmans orders, Valdez and others dug a hole in a nearby graveyard and took the man there, where El Chapo began interrogating him again and shot him with a handgun, screaming You motherf***er, the New York Post reported. Valdez told the court the man was gasping for air when he was dumped in the hole and buried. The bodyguard described two other alleged killings - involving rivals who were from Guzmans home state of Sinaloa but worked for the rival Zetas cartel - that happened around the same time. The rivals were beaten by some of Guzmans men before he took a large stick and battered them with it for three hours, it is alleged. Valdez said: “The people were pretty much like rag dolls. The bones in their bodies were fractured. They couldn’t move. “[El Chapo] was telling them, ‘You motherf***ers, how is it possible that you are working for them and betraying us ’”  Guzman allegedly ordered his men to dig a large hole and light a bonfire inside it. He then brought the men there and shot both of them in the head. Valdez said: “He came up and put the rle to the head of one of them and said, ‘f*** your mother, and boom, he shot him in the head. He said, I dont want any bones to remain. The mens corpses were tossed into the burning pit and their bones were later ground up to eliminate any trace of them, it is alleged. Guzman was extradited to the US in  and has been on trial since November on charges of trafficking huge amounts of cocaine, heroin and other drugs into America.  His lawyers claim he was framed by a powerful drug trafficker, Ismael El Mayo Zambada. Valdez claims Zambada delivered the rival Arellano-Felix drug cartel member to El Chapo, saying Guzman was displeased to find that the man had already been tortured with an iron. Guzman later ordered Valdez to be killed, wrongly thinking that his bodyguard was stealing money. Valdez said he was terried, so he went into hiding, turned off all communication and even faked having a broken leg, sending photos of himself in a plaster at El Chapos request. El Chapos men eventually found Valdez - blindfolding and handcuffing him after tossing him into an armoured pickup truck - but he managed to persuade them not to kill him. El Chapo later dropped the kill order and called Valdez to tell him he had been fed lies, said Valdez, who claims he went on to pilot drug planes for the cartel. Guzman is alleged to have told him: Were family. Prosecutors expect to wrap up their case on Monday after three months of evidence. It is not yet knownGuzman will testy when his lawyers call their own witnesses.

Prosecutors previously alleged Lewis Bennett intentionally inflicted the damage to sink the vessel in the Bahamas in . The -year-old has already pleaded guilty to killing Isabella Hellman on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He reached a deal last November in which he said his wes death was an accident caused by negligence - and he didnt witness what happened. However, a court in Florida was shown new evidence today by prosecutors seeking a maximum term in a sentencing hearing next week. Kurt Lunkenheimer urged a judge to go above sentencing guidelines, reports CBS .   The court was also shown pictures of the le raft where Bennett was found with his luggage and provisions. In the papers filed to court, Lunkenheimer argued the fact that the defendant would pack all of these items into a le raft, but not actively and diligently look for his we was among reasons requiring an eight-year sentence. As part of his plea, Bennett agreed to ask for no less than seven years in jail.  Until his deal he had long maintained he had no knowledge of how his bride disappeared from their -ft catamaran as they sailed from Cuba to Florida. However, last week week Isabellas family wrote to the judge asking him to reconsider the plea deal and instead class her death as murder. According to the letter, they want Bennett to go through a trial and be acquitted than to allow him to plead involuntary manslaughter.   That Lewis Bennett is being allowed to plead to involuntary manslaughter is outrageous to us, the letter read. While our lawyer has explained to us that these facts are circumstantial and may not result in a conviction of murder, we strongly believe that a plea to involuntary manslaughter is not only insufficient but actually less consistent with the facts than an acquittal or a murder conviction would be. Hellmans family also say they have struggled with being unable to see Emelia, Hellman and Bennetts daughter. She currently lives with Bennetts family in the UK.   According to the criminal affidavit, US prosecutors believed Bennett intentionally sank their boat. He was able to save himself and pound, worth of silver and gold coins. They had come from a vessel he was a crew member of in St Maarten in . Cops later found  more coins at the Florida home he shared with his American we. The US coast guard called off its search for Hellmann after four days of being alerted to her disappearance. Bennett claimed his we was at the helm as he slept, but he was jolted awake to find the boat badly damaged and no sign of her.  Bennett, a Bangor University graduate, told the US Coast Guard that Hellmann was on deck and wearing a le jacket as he went to bed at pm on May , just a few hours after they had left Havana. He placed a distress call five hours later and was alone when a helicopter crew pulled him from the sea, about  miles south of Florida, in the early hours of May . Hellmann’s body has never been found. Bennett’s sentencing will take place on January  in Miami.

Lara Hall, , met a man called Sajjad online through friends from Lahore, who wooed her by telling her she would live in a Spanish-style villa and that he would “fill in all the blank spaces” in her troubled le. The law graduate, who suffered from OCD and came from a dysal family, said she was “completely vulnerable” to Sajjad’s charms, especially at a time when her le in Sydney was “s***”. However, once she arrived in Pakistan the horrying truth about him began to emerge. Lara flew to Lahore to meet Sajjad for the first time early last year for his brother’s wedding so she could seetheir internet romance could turn into the real thing.  But when she arrived she discovered the house he lived in was filthy with  people living in five rooms. Over the next few weeks Sajjad admitted that he had fabricated the Spanish villa story and that he was not the man he had claimed to be. Then the abuse started, she said, and she couldn’t leave as Sajjad told her that because her visa had expired she would be arrestedshe left the house. She said: “Sajjad raped me and his brother attempted to rape me on multiple occasions. “I was a kept woman, I was denied feminine hygiene products and had to bleed freely, I was starved over long periods of time - on one occasion up to  hours.” Lara also revealed that Sajjad once even tried to rape her while she was vomiting and that he once made her lie on the bed with her legs spread to “air her vagina”. He also tried to get her to convert to Islam and when she refused he “became furious”. Lara managed to contact the Australian consulate but said that their reaction was “lacklustre” and they merely advised her to find a safer place to stay.   She was too afraid to go to the local police also for fear of word getting back. Eventually Lara managed to contact the chief executive of an elite private members club for diplomats and the armed forces via Facebook . Dr Kaiser Rafiq told local police that Lara was being kept against her will and she was rescued. She stayed with him for a few weeks before flying to Islamabad to try to sort out how to get back home. Dr Rafiq told Daily Mail Australia: “I find her extremely genius and positive person but I was disappointed and somewhat angry at her for coming to a totally strange country and strange people whom she met only through internet. “Our youth must learn that the internet is not a safe place and we must not believe fantasies which someone portrays on internet.” Lara then contacted the British Pakistani Christian Association to try and get funds to fly back to Australia - who agreed to help her. Wilson Chowdry, head of the organisation, blasted the Australian government for not taking Lara’s plight seriously. She is now safely back in Australia and is campaigning so that other Australians in dficulty while abroad should not be “left behind”. To sign Ms Halls petition, clickhere.

When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience. Bridge uses the new musical freedoms only when justied, being happy toto more traditional tonal stability in the lyrical sections.Fulfilled, but not overburdened by the weightiness of the final piece, the audience applauded Jamal and Jâms back to the concert room to perform the ‘Swan’ from Saint-Saens ‘Carnival of the Animals’ as encore. This piece so beautully confirmed the excellence of Jamal’s playing and the superb quality of his quite special instrument.PIC:Jamal Aliyev and Jâms Coleman. no_aJamalandJam"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray carpet bowling club festive pairs competition","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray Carpet Bowling Club held its annual festive pairs competition.The first prize of turkeys was won by George Morrison and Alan Cameron.

In summary, Mr Anstee explained, not a lot had changed since an earlier report, though a lot of remedial work would be needed.Mr Anstee added that the question is: #What use to people want to make of the hall  Do we need it at all #The next question is whether the hall should be demolished and a new facility built or whether the facade should be retained # for which heritage grant funding may be available. A sense of frustration was evident in the hall as people heard about surveys and consultation # a familiar theme for Inspire Inveraray since its formation three years ago.Hotelier Donald Clark clearly wants to see action and is not keen on retaining the old building. He said: #It#s an eyesore. I think we need to work on the premise of demolition then decide on the use of it.#Next it was on to the vexed question of Inveraray Pier. Numerous attempts to start a dialogue with the owner Archie MacArthur had failed, said Mr Anstee.One approach Inspire Inveraray is looking at is to attempt to purchase the pier using community Right to Buy legislation. There is also the question of whether to bid for the puffer, which Mr MacArthur is trying to sell, as well as the pier itself.To get to the bottom of the community#s views, consultant Charlotte Lee has been employed to pull together opinions and draw up a community action plan.Of only slightly lesser importance is the telephone box in Church Square, in which Inspire Inveraray has expressed an interest. If BT agrees to hand it over, the next question is what to do with it.The many questions highlighted during the evening in connection with the community centre, pier and even the phonebox will be condensed into a straightforward questionnaire to be handed round Inveraray homes with the help of Inveraray Community Council.Anyone wishing to contribute their views or help with the consultation can contact Charlotte Lee on info@cslconsultancy.net or call  ."},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"caravan caught alight sparks major","story":"NewsCaravan which caught alight sparks major fire operationThe derelict property on Kilmarnock Road in Monkton went up in flames last Thursday night as the caravan attached to it caught fire.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  JAN NewsThe fire spread to the adjacent property \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA caravan which caught alight sparked a large scale fire operation as it set ablaze to a neighbouring house.

Everyone talks about Lawrence but, in my opinion, Michael Rose could go on to achieve just as much -not more -he wants to.  He is that good a player and Ive no doubt he can be a future Scotland international. For my money hes been the best centre half in the Championship this season.

Rose is one of a number of players to reinvent their careers under McCall following his failure to break through as a youth at Aberdeen.

And the shining star of the region’s education system confesses she is now “living in a bubble waiting for it to burst”. Gaenor, who joins Heathfield after heading up Dalmilling Primary for five years, said: “I was very happy there and only Heathfield would have pulled me away. “It is always the school I have aspired to.

I had a lot of balls left because Georgie loved them and my other dog doesnt so I put them in the box at the Gattonside end of chain bridge.\"Since then someone has attached it to the gate and people have been borrowing the balls and putting them back and even adding new ones.\"I just want the box to remind owners to enjoy every moment with their dog.\"Georgie passed away in May last year after contracting Alabama rot, also known as Cutaneous and Renal Glomerular Vasculopathy .Only appearing to affect dogs, the disease damages the lining of blood vessels in the skin and kidney, resulting in ulceration of the skin and kidney damage.The condition can affect any breed or age of dog and a proportion can go on to develop severe, acute kidney failure, which is often fatal.Lynsay and her dogs Georgie and Taffy used to walk along the river most days and it was after one of these walks that she noticed Georgie had lesions on her legs.\"It was after a walk in Gattonside one Saturday that I saw that she had sores on her legs so I took her to the vet on Monday and she was given some cream.\"But she went downhill fast and by Wednesday her poo was black, which I later learnt was a sign that her kidneys were failing.\"I took her to the vets again where she was given a cone to stop her licking the sores but by Friday the vets suspected it was Alabama rot and put her on a drip and kept her in overnight hoping that she would improve.\"But on Saturday we were told that her kidneys had stopped working and she wasnt going to get better.\"I took Taffy with me to spend some time with her and then she got put to sleep.\"Alabama rot was first recorded in the UK in  and the number of cases has risen each year. Georgies was the first confirmed case in the Borders.Lynsay said: \"The only way that you can be sure it is Alabama rot is to have a post mortem so Georgie was then taken to the Dick Vet in Edinburgh where it was confirmed that she had had Alabama rot. My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation. There is speculation that it is related to mud or water, due to the higher prevalence in winter and spring, and relatively low case numbers seen in the summer.Caroline continued: ldquoTo lower any risk of your dog contracting Alabama rot, itrsquos also advisable to keep your dog away from very muddy areas, wash wet or muddy dogs straight after a walk and regularly check your dogrsquos body for anything thatrsquos dferent.,params: .pushldquoWhile a distinct seasonal pattern is suggested, we must continue to research this deadly disease and ensure all dog owners are aware of the signs and symptoms so they are able to seek veterinary advice immediately.Despite what happened, Lynsay still s to walk Taffy along the river in Gattonside.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

My own wish would be for MPs to seize the moment and vote to revoke Article  altogether. MPs have the power to stop the clock for good, thanks to the good works of legally-minded MPs like the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry.Staying in the EU is the only sure way to stop the endless arguments about Canada plus, Norway plus, customs union, Irish backstop, regulatory alignment, maximum facilitation and all the rest of the gubbins thatrsquos been occupying our addled brains for the last two-and-a-half years. However, this isnrsquot going to happen.And Irsquod have to agree that it would be undemocratic for MPs to simply reverse the result of the  referendum by revoking A. It may be that Parliament has the power and the constitutional right to do so: referendums are only advisory. But it would leave so much unpleasantness that British politics would be soured for decades. There would have to be a referendum.This is where my unease turns to genuine anxiety. I have a horrible feeling that Labourrsquos Diane Abbott was right on Question Time this week when she said: ldquoBe careful what you wish for. She agrees with Nigel Farage that a repeat referendum is likely to endorse no-deal Brexit, perhaps by an even greater margin than in .Evenit left us with a mirror-image result, with say % Remain against % Leave, that would itself be a disaster because it would have no legitimacy. Yes, some opinion polls say Remain would win a comfortable majority, but they said that last time.The Brexiteers are already field-testing their slogans on social media. The frontrunner is ldquoTell Them Again, which may not be as resonant as ldquoTake Back Control but is still pretty hot. It surfs on the very widespread disgust and alienation that many ordinary people feel about the political elite. It appeals to democratic injustice: how dare the globalists ignore the result of , which David Cameron promised would be for keeps What would Remainrsquos slogan be  Itrsquos likely to be a repeat of the Project Fear line which failed dismally in . ldquoDonrsquot put your childrenrsquos prosperity at risk, perhaps, or ldquoThink Twice Think Jobs. But what many pro-Europeans fail to grasp ndash and this applied to the Unionists in the Scottish independence referendum ndash is that it ISNrsquoT the economy, stupid. Brexit voters donrsquot just make their decisions on the basis of economic rationality, as seen from the CBI and corporate Britain.People are always motivated more by emotion than numbers ndash on what they believe to be morally right. The sense that working-class people have lost control is a very potent mobiliser.As in war ndash and it is remarkable how much Brexit mythology harks back to World War Two ndash people are quite willing to sacrice some comfort for what they believe in.I may think they are mistaken. As with the people who supported Donald Trump because he promised to Make America Great Again, and bring back the jobs, I think Brexit voters have been sold a  prospectus by politicians who do not have the best interests of working people at their hearts.But that isnrsquot really the point. I can well understand the sense of injustice felt by people who have been left behind by global capitalism. They want to kick the system, and the referendum gave them a chance to do it. They need a very strong reason not to kick the metropolitans again. Only Labour can provide that reason, and Jeremy Corbyn has been singularly reluctant to do so.His refusal even to meet Theresa May was irresponsible in this climate. It may have allowed him to avoid coming off the fence, but it looked petty and weak. Corbyn should have gone in guns blazing, demanded that she drop the red lines, and then mobilised Labour for either rejoining the single market or for a referendum.Single market membership has always been the logic of Labourrsquos position, even though Corbyn usually refers to a ldquopermanent customs union. Only by joining the European Economic Area could Labour deliver friction-free trade, and protect environmental standards and workers rights. People say that Norway has blocked the UKrsquos entry to the European Economic Area, but this is not true. The Norwegian PM, Erna Solberg, has repeatedly made clear that Norway would have severe reservations ndashwho wouldnrsquot  ndash but would not block UK membership.This is because the EEA is essentially a Brussels creation. It was set up as a halfway house to membership of the EU back in  when a number of countries were uneasy about joining the political institutions of Europe. The EEA is just the European Single Market under another name.Brussels endorses British membership of the EEA, and this economic arrangement has a number of advantages over Mayrsquos deal. Therersquos no need for an Irish backstop no membership of the CAP and the Common Fisheries Policy no direct jurisdiction of the European Court and it costs less than EU membership. Of course, it does not bring the full benefits of EU membership. Britain would become a ldquorule taker on trade. But the EEA does not preclude future membership of the European Union. Norway, or any other member of the EEA, can opt for full membership at any time. And unlike the backstop, countries can leave the EEA after one year.Membership of the single market also means accepting freedom of movement, which is why it may well be rejected by Parliament. But it is the only option that has a snowballrsquos chance of getting a majority,Labour were to seriously support it. ldquoNorway plus, as itrsquos called, has more support than a repeat referendum. Fewer than  Labour MPs have called for a Peoples Vote, and only  Conservatives. The SNP has decided to throw its lot in with a repeat referendum, despite having argued convincingly for the single market for the last two years. But that isnrsquot enough.To repeat. Were it left to me, I would revoke Article  tomorrow. I just want this madness to stop. But given the metrics in Parliament, we have to look at the least worst options, as the Labour-supporting commentator Owen Jones put it last week. Mayrsquos deal is dead. MPs owe it to the country, and to themselves, to find some compromise that works. Perhaps that can only be achieved with a referendum. ButMPs fail this week, they risk destroying respect for parliamentary democracy, and opening the way for a more authoritarian form of political leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-paul-mccartney-cant-dye-me-love","story":"BIT icy in Glasgow yesterday.

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards. And the endless saga of RET must come to an end, otherwise how can bidding companies submit a proposed fare policy ”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

OIC Leader James Stockan has notied Ministers that the council will hand over responsibility for running the service to Transport Scotland, unless sufficient funding is provided.A year ago, a similar level of support was secured, after a y campaign by OIC for fair funding. Of this, £. million was allocated to fully fund Orkney’s internal ferry service during the current financial year, with £ million awarded to Shetland Islands Council for its ferry operations.“But this time there is no specic amount allocated to Orkney or Shetland. The government recognises that it will cost £. million to operate our ageing fleet of ferries during - — and that is what we are asking the government to provide.”OIC is also looking to the government to fund the replacement of the current inter-island fleet. The council has been working with the government on this for a number of years and is currently developing a business case setting out the service levels local communities require, and the engineering options needed to achieve these.Councillor Stockan added: “We would object in the strongest possible termswe end up with a reduction in our ferries funding. This would place a wholly disproportionate and unfair burden on the smallest council in Scotland and would mean us having to make cuts to other vital services.“The ferries are a leline for remote and fragile communities across our islands. Orkney has the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — an inequality we cannot address without proper financial support from the Scottish Government.We are calling on the government to take an honourable approach to fulfilling the will of the Scottish Parliament that we should receive fair and equitable funding for our inter-island ferry service. The principle of transferring Orkney’s internal ferry service to the Scottish Government, at no net detriment to OIC, has already been approved by the council. That is a route we will have to take unless we are provided with the funds to run the service over the year ahead.”For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Tourists visiting Scotland may also have some fun by using the haggis emoji as part of their messages to friends and family at home.

If they won#t support May, they must give the final say to #the people#.It is indeed a “disgrace”, as Airbus chief executive Tom Enders lamented, that more than two-and-a-half years after the Brexit referendum, we still do not know what is going to happen on  March.But everyone should be very clear that, at the moment, the UK is heading for a no-deal Brexit unless our MPs take action to prevent it.Just last week, one of two courses of action that would prevent a no-deal – Theresa May’s Brexit plan – suffered the biggest government defeat in the Commons for more than a century. And yesterday, MPs who support the other option – a second EU referendum – admitted the idea did not have enough support and withdrew an amendment to next week’s vote on May’s deal.: Mike Russell: Scots ‘have right’ to consider independence as Brexit alternativeConservative MP Sarah Wollaston said they had done so with “great regret” but that, without the support of Jeremy Corbyn, the amendment would have failed. Labour MP Luciana Berger called on her party leader to “do the right thing”, adding that Labour should not be “facilitating a job-destroying Brexit”. Corbyn’s inability to get off the fence, coupled with May’s stubborn determination to stick with her deal, is pushing Britain ever closer to the now infamous “clf-edge” of a no-deal, as hardline Brexiteers celebrate. In their latest dubious pronouncement, Lord Tebbit claimed that this outcome would result in cheaper alcohol.As The Scotsman has repeatedly said,MPs want Brexit to happen on  March, they should vote for May’s plan. It will damage our economy – as will all forms of Brexit – but it will be as nothing compared to the impact of a chaotic plunge into World Trade Organisation rules. Our economy is far too closely intertwined with the EU’s for such a sudden wrench and we are woefully unprepared.: Lord Tebbit: No-deal Brexit will mean cheaper booze for UKAs Enders warned,the UK does not alter course, Airbus could move its operations out of the country. Many more firms may do the same. Sony has announced its European base is to move to the Netherlands and that country’s government is in talks with more than  British companies about relocating.MPs have an over-riding duty to act in the national interest – evenit may be unpopular. Right now, it is clearly in the national interest to delay Brexit to allow the will of the people to be expressed once more. We the people now know what we are getting intothe UK leaves the EU.

Well, something is changing. You can tell from the fact Nicola Sturgeon was in Downing Street on Wednesday night.Remember that not long ago, the UK Government was happy to let it be known the First Minister of Scotland was barred from meeting the Prime Minister. Months could pass without high level meetings between the Scottish and UK Governments.Until the end of last year, Downing Street wasn’t keen on having Sturgeon around because with Brexit in chaos, all it did was give the SNP leader a chance to trash Theresa May in front of the cameras outside Number ’s door, unanswered.This week, the UK Government issued the First Minister a special invitation. Devolved administrations were offered an “enhanced role” in Brexit talks and a seat on a key Cabinet sub-committee that will lead preparations for EU exit.: Nicola Sturgeon: Theresa May ‘running scared’ of independenceThe photo op now benefits both sides. Why  Because Downing Street and the SNP know they’re fighting a dferent battle. The war for Brexit is nearly over. They know the fight over indyref is upon us. Sturgeon was already struggling to resist vocal demands to produce a roadmap to a second independence referendum from her own supporters and parliamentarians. The outcome of Brexit will force her hand, in any case.Influential Scots in the UK Government know it needs better ammunition to fight the inevitable demand for another vote. David Mundell has written to the Prime Minister saying as much, and on Wednesday, both sides tested their new lines. Senior UK Government sources say they are ready. “Bring it on,” one told me – the fight about the referendum, not vote itself. Expect the Downing Street line against indyref to harden further.The path to a second independence referendum is at least as long and winding as the one the UK has followed towards Brexit day.

To date no case in Scotland has been stopped because of prejudicial publicity and that’s despite there having been some high-profile cases that attracted considerable, sometimes extremely prejudicial, media attention.These cases were dferent in that the accused were not well-known public figures, but it was argued that publicity about the allegations could prejudice any trial.I wouldn’t call this case unprecedented, but it has its own unique aspects. However, the challenges for the court have been considered before. Two examples are the trial of William Beggs for what became known as the “Limbs in the Loch” murder, and that of Nat Fraser, who was accused of killing his we, Arlene. There had been a great deal of reporting about the cases and the courts had to decide whether fair trials could be achieved. In both situations, the courts decided the cases could proceed fairly, referring to the safeguards of the passage of time between any publicity and a trial the focusing effect for a jury of listening to the evidence and the strong directions given to a jury in such cases to decide only based on evidence they hear in court.Those representing Salmond may argue that he is uniquely well-known and that some allegations against him have, to an extent, been canvassed in the media. They may say that it will be almost impossible to find jurors who have never heard of him. But that doesn’t matter – more to the point is whether it will be possible to find jurors that are untainted by prejudicial knowledge about the allegations.The Crown will say Contempt of Court rules apply and no-one can now publish anything that might prejudice the trial. There is now signicant protection in place and the media can only really report on procedural aspects such as the fact he has been charged.Very senior people at the Crown Office will be involved in decisions about possible proceedings once they have seen all statements and reports.

A police investigation is taking place into the allegations made by two women and dating back to when he was first minister. But Mr Salmond won a legal challenge against the Scottish Government over its handling of the claims.The Scottish Government is carrying out a review of what happened and Ms Sturgeon has referred herself to independent advisers to consider whether she breached the ministerial code during meetings and phone calls with her predecessor. Mr Salmond said Ms Sturgeon’s focus should be on the drive to bring about independence. He said: “Nicola should be concentrating all her energies on the independence agenda where we will never have better circumstances. As far as I am concerned Westminster’s Brexit dficulty should be Scotland’s opportunity.” Ms Sturgeon is to give an update to the Scottish Parliament on her plans in the coming weeks. A formal request for a Section  order which would give Holyrood the authority to stage a referendum was rejected by the UK government last year, with Prime Minister Theresa may insisting “now is not the time” to revisit the Scottish constitutional issue amid the Brexit uncertainty. It is understood that a further request by the Scottish Government would also be rejected by Westminster.Writing in the Sunday National newspaper yesterday, Mr Salmond said: “One of our features in the national movement has been our inability to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of our political opponents. We have tended to concentrate on the shape we’re in.“However, right now the Westminster political establishment is at its weakest point in my letime while the national movement is in good heart. There is not likely to be a better time to force the issue.”However former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars warned there is “no appetite” for a second independence referendum. He said: “There is no national Yes organisation in place – a prerequisite to success as many Yes activists and voters are not SNP.“No policy work has been done on the post-Brexit situation and thus we are not in a position to deploy then new policies in that post-Brexit new paradigm that will be needed to convince No voters to vote Yes next time.”Polls indicate there has been no rise in support for independence among Scots since the last vote in  and Perth and North Perthshire MP Pete Wishart said a vote should be held when it can be won.He said: “We are already making progress towards that with Brexit as the catalyst. But it will be dficult to secure the conditions to make a referendum happen before the next Holyrood election.”Alex Bell, a former SNP government adviser also called for a more considered approach.He said: “The SNP and Yes have to stop seeing independence as a sneaky prize to be won when everyone  is messing up and instead base their campaign on the reality of what Scotland can achieve through an honest understanding of the world.”Ms Sturgeon had pledged to hold a second referendum in the immediate aftermath of Brexit but “reset” her plans after the SNP suffered heavy losses in the  UK election.At First Minister’s Questions last week, she said: “Given the catastrophe that Scotland faces in our economy, our society, our living standards, the prospects for the next generation and our reputation in the world, it is essential that the option of independence is open to people in Scotland.“When people in Scotland have the ability to choose independence, I believe that the country will opt to be an independent one.”The Scottish Parliament has already voted in favour of a second referendum following the Brexit vote as the SNP combined with the pro-independence Greens.\u2028Scottish Secretary David Mundell has written to Mrs May to urge her to maintain her refusal to grant Holyrood powers for a second independence referendum.If the authority to hold a second referendum through a Section  is rejected, as expected, by the UK government, it has been suggested that the Scottish Government could make this the central issue of the next Holyrood election in , as it seeks to build the case for a independence in the years ahead.\u2028Tory constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins suggested Ms Sturgeon will seek a Section  order in the knowledge it will be rejected by in order to “stir up as much grievance and bad feeling as possible”.Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader Willie Rennie urged the SNP to abandon plans for another referendum. A Scottish Labour source added: “The last thing Scotland needs is more instability and chaos of yet another independence referendum, what our communities need are Labour governments here and in Westminster to end austerity.”An SNP spokesman said: “With the clock ticking down to Brexit date - and with the Tory government incapable of governing and Labour incapable of effectively opposing - the SNP will continue to focus on standing up for Scotland’s interests in the face of a disastrous Tory-driven Brexit and further austerity.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4848739.1547813565!/image/image.jpg","title":"these are the 6 most wanted people in scotland in 2019","story":"Can you help police track down these  men on their most wanted list Police Scotland would like to speak to the people below and are asking anyone with information to call .©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"airport staff defended after criticism over parking system ","story":"A Bressay resident has praised staff at Sumburgh Airport after criticism over the newly introduced parking charges and the situation for disabled drivers.Last week Joyce Davies, from Skeld, bemoaned the new set-up.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players from throughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams from Bun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SEALL-Logo-main-300x193.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face. to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

The  album release ‘Up Among The Heather, The Scottish Album’, reflects the Scots influence on their Northern Irish roots - the album will be released on tour. Last year, their previous album ‘The Unicorn, the Continuing Story’ gave the long-awaited sequel to their famed Unicorn song.BRAID DATEBand leader, George Millar says: “In some ways it seems like yesterday, in other ways it seems a million years ago when I first met and played with Jimmy . “Neither of us had any idea what could possibly be ahead of us. Tohome and play after all these years, will be a highlight of our career and one we’re looking forward to immensely. Like the famous Bushmills Irish Whiskey, The Irish Rovers continue to improve with age and The Braid Arts Centre and Mid  East Antrim Borough Council are delighted that the boys are making a visit home to be applauded for all they have done over the years for the music industry, and for promoting this part of the world across North America and beyond. Thursday March  will see the Rovers will be performing at The Braid and they will be guests of honour at a reception where the Mid  East Antrim will welcome them home.AIR AMBULANCEAll proceeds from tickets will be donated by The Irish Rovers to the Mayors Charity Northern Ireland Air Ambulance.Another great honour for the band this year was being recognized as one of these islands greatest eacutemigreacutes by Ireland’s newest and most state of the art museum in Dublin, EPIC Ireland. Museum Director Mervyn Greene says: “The Irish Rovers are iconic, world class and with very a long career. “That’s important to us in Ireland. “They’ve truly taken Ireland with them and shown the world.As it happens, The Unicorn album is part of EPIC’s Irish Rovers installation. As young immigrants, the Rovers emigrated to Canada and became so much a part of the Canadian culture that Canada’s Prime Minister Trudeau personally asked them to become full citizens so they could officially represent Canada around the world.In , The Irish Rovers had a breakout hit with their second album, The Unicorn.That album and the ‘lucky little ditty’ of a title track written by Shel Silverstein, took them from folk clubs of America to concert halls and television sets worldwide.LAST MINUTE“The Unicorn, which was in fact a last minute add to the original album, left us all with a tear or two, plus the unanswered question, ‘Whatever happened to the Unicorns when the ark left them stranded on the shore ” says George. Since that first big hit, the band ed to the charts  more times with other songs, nevertheless, the magic of ‘The Unicorn’ remains.To pay appropriate tribute on its Gold Anniversary, the Rovers are releasing ‘The Unicorn, The Continuing Story’.It includes all new recordings, plus the sequel to the original song, which answers the question of the last fty years.A new music video also tells the story.The World Wildle Fund, and wildle cinematographer Adam Ravetch assisted in the production. Since the s, the Celtic super-group have travelled the world as musical ambassadors - with performances from as far apart as the Arctic Circle, Japan, and Germany, with regular tours to Australia, New Zealand, and the US.The Rovers first became known in the US in the s on shows like The Tonight Show, The Smothers Brothers, Mike Douglas Show, The Dating Game , and even starring in The Virginian.In the s they hosted their first of three international television series, ‘The Irish Rovers Show’ and throughout the next  years their weekly television shows brought Ireland into living rooms of America and the rest of the world.More recently, their  Drunken Sailor album went viral on YouTube, made news headlines back home in Belfast and put them back on radio across North America with a new younger generation audience.A Canadian CBC producer saw the Belfast news articles about the Rovers new song and video and asked George Millar to sing his new song ‘The Titanic’ to help their telling of the th Anniversary of Titanic. The   Years triple CD broke tour sales records, while the lads ed to the small screen with three North American television specials, ‘The Irish Rovers Home In Ireland’, ‘The Irish Rovers Christmas’, ‘The Irish Rovers LIVE on St. Patrick’s Day  th Anniversary Special’, all produced in the last few years.The days of the long tours are finally coming to an end for these Irish lads as they are now completing one last world tour.

P children from Seymour Hill met with Mrs Jess before her birthday and found out more about her le, before sharing the story with the rest of the school.School Principal Mr Stephen Nimmons explained: “During World War Two Mrs Jess worked at a hem stitching factory near Dromore, where she worked on the machines and made fancy patterns around pillow cases and table cloths. “Every day she would have to cycle four miles to work and in the evenings four miles back home – rain, hail or snow. When the war was at its height, the factory started making unorms for the soldiers. From her house in Kinallen, she could see the lights of Belfast light up the sky when the German bombers came.“Just after the war, in , Mrs Jess married and went on to have three daughters. She has been a widow for  years and now has three children, six grandchildren and six great grandchildren. “Mrs Jess came to live in Seymour Hill on February ,  when there were no schools, shops nor churches built on the estate at the time. Seymour Hill Primary School was built by September  when the first pupils started the school. “She started working in the school when it opened in  and she worked in the school for over  years until her retirement. She worked as a cleaner for most of those years, as well as being a lunchtime supervisor and for a short time, she was also the school caretaker.“The children, staff and PTA of Seymour Hill PS wish to thank Mrs Jess for taking time to talk with them and visit the school on such a special occasion.”IN PICTURES: Banbridge and Dromore students honoured at Action MS Awards Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8781919.1548265986!/image/image.jpg","title":"rathfriland yfc hold meeting","story":"Recently Rathfriland YFC held their Annual General Meeting chaired by Benjamin Allen from Collone YFC.The club would like to thank all outgoing office bearers and committee members for their dedication and effort over the year and congratulate the following club members on taking up their new roles mid April within the club committee.Rathfriland YFC held their Annual General Meeting.

We regard this as the most important constitutional gathering in a generation,” he said.The conference comes as uncertainty continues to remain over the issue of the Irish border backstop along with the need to ensure EU rights are protected after Brexit.Last November one thousand prominent nationalistsportspeople, artists, actors and leading business heads put their signatories to an open letter to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar outlining their concerns.

But, after representations from his solicitor, it was agreed that the fine would be waived when it was learned that no tax book had been available for the vehicle.He was held for an hour and a half in Dunmurry and was released when a relative arrived and paid the fine.The RUC men – one of whom was in plain clothes – had arrived in the area in a red Vauxhall car without markings.One Twinbrook resident said later: “So much for the RUC’s concern about the peace talks. They wouldn’t have done that sort of thing before the ceasefire.”Order is expected soon for new IRA ceasefireA NEW ceasefire order is expected to be issued to all IRA units within the next  hours. But a formal announcement by the Republican Army Council is not expected until early next week.The decision to order a ceasefire came after a second round of talks between senior Stormont and republican officials at a secret venue about five miles from Belfast on Wednesday night.In a statement issued late on Wednesday Britain’s supremo here, Merlyn Rees, said: “I am sure that the people of Northern Ireland would wish to see effective arrangements made to ensure that the ceasefire did not break down. I attach very great importance to this, and practical arrangements would be necessary.”Republican leaders are now believed to regard this as a sufficient gesture to allow them to order another ceasefire.But it is believed that they will want meaningful talks on a number of issues shortly after their ceasefire is publicly announced. Another reason why a new ceasefire is possible has been the low profile approach adopted by the British Army since the shock announcement last week that the truce was off.A key factor in the decision to call off the Christmas ceasefire was the behaviour of British units in Belfast and several rural areas where they stepped up their activity to take advantage of the ceasefire.British leaders in London are known to have been surprised at the IRA decision and there has been speculation that advice from their military leaders – who had claimed that the IRA ceasefire was certain to continue because the IRA was beaten – is now being ignored by Westminster leaders.British Premier Wilson is said to have been furious that the much-vaunted military intelligence network in Ireland was totally unaware that the ceasefire was in danger.And parallels are being drawn between the military intelligence blunder of last week and similar blunders before Internment Day and Operation Motorman – when politicians were advised that both moves would “help solve the Irish question”.

It was a great event, with fantastic music provided by the McCourt brothers, and some equally impressive socialising done by the McKays, McDonalds, Quinns, McAteers, Pattersons, Monaghans, Lintons# and plenty of others, including a couple of Deedses.The oldest party-goer was Mrs Sheila Deane, at a brave  years of age. I got speaking to MrsDeane that night and as always, she had a smile on her face and was in good spirits. Sadly, MrsDeane passed away on January this year.The street was our playground growing up in Arizona Street Upton Cottage in the ‘s and ‘s. We were never in. While our parents probably appreciated this, I’m not sure that all of the older residents enjoyed the noise and occasional nuisance as much. Some of our older neighbours when passing might have greeted us young ones with no more than a scowl, a grunt, or even worse . Mrs Deane however, was friendly and approachable every time you saw her. Uniquely as well, she always remembered my name. My brothers and I were very good friends with MrsDeane’s grandsons Neil, David and Mark, just down the street. Every night since I can remember, their dad Seamus made the short trek up the street past our house to visit his mum in the cottages. I spoke to Seamus recently and he kindly shared some of his own, earlier childhood memories of our wee street.Mr and Mrs Deane moved in to number  Upton Cottages on the Glen Road in , and at that time the street was still not too dissimilar from the way it looked when the houses were first built. Upton Cottages first appears in Belfast Street directories in , when they formed the only small terrace resembling a street anywhere in West Belfast beyond the Falls Road. At that time, and for almost another  years, the area beyond Upton Cottages marked the start of the country, and there was very little to be found after it going up the Glen Road apart from farms and fields. The single-sided Arizona Driveappears in the street directories for the first time in , with the opposite side and new name of Arizona Street listed the following year. Several other homes of ying size soon began to spring up along the Glen Road around the growing parish of St Teresa’s. Gransha and Andersonstown estates followed shortly after and the whole area became much less rural in character. One former resident of Woodland House on the Upper Springfield Road remembered walking down the Turf Loney to go to Sunday school on the Glen Road in the s, only to be chased back across the stream at Upton Cottages for being ‘country children’!Still, in  the area was unrecognisable from how it looks today. Beyond the cottages was all fields going right up from the Falls to Hannahstown Hill. Before Turf Lodge was built to meet the rapidly increasing demand for social housing in West Belfast, Seamus Deane remembers playing from dawn to dusk in the meadows there throughout his childhood. Arizona Street, Seamus recalls, was still only three quarters built in the ‘s. In fact, the house that I grew up in near the top, and any others after number , were built around a decade later. These were known as the ‘corporation houses’, having been appended to the existing houses by the council in the ‘s. In the s Sheila Deane and her family looked out at a single four bedroom house – number  Upton Cottages and the first on that side – beside which was Sherf’s timber yard . Both sites would later be taken up by McErlean’s Bakery that employed generations of the area’s youth. Before the bakery was built however, long piles of timber from Sherf’s yard lay in the field between the Deanes’ house and the bottom half of Arizona Street. The vacant ground beside it, part of which would one day become our back garden, was the site of the annual bonfire. According to one older resident, there had been an orchard there in even earlier times. Geraldine Mallonwho told me this was someone I was heart scared of as a child. She and the neighbour facing her, Jim Butler, were tortured by us kids kicking balls and hitting sliotars around their doors. And they were never too slow in coming out to tell us to take them away to hell’s gates. Ironically, both Jim and Geraldine became good neighbours of mine when I got older and moved in beside them, and we stayed friendly until they passed away in recent years.Other former residents of Upton Cottages include members of the RIC, a private in the Free State Army and two soldiers who lost their lives in the First World War, one of whom is among the Canadian Infantry buried in the City Cemetery.And the street keeps changing. Like so many other families, MrsDeane’s children and grandchildren are scattered near and far. Her sons Paul and Seamus continued to make their daily pilgrimage up our street back home to see their mum until her final days. This special lady won’t be forgotten, nor will our memories of a grand wee community – one of the last of its kind – that has spread out across our beautul former meadows from the Falls to Hannahstown, and further afield."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"toibin to host new party belfast meeting","story":"FORMER Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín has said that his new party hopes to select candidates for the North’s upcoming Council elections by early February.The Meath TD left Sinn Féin in November over the party’s decision to back legislation allowing for abortion.The as yet unnamed party is set to host a meeting at the Malone Lodge in Belfast this Monday with a view to setting up local branches.Speaking to the Daily Belfast ahead of the meeting, Mr Tóibín said it was not his intention to “clip the ear off” Sinn Féin based on his past experience, but rather to build a “broader” republican party.“I believe over the last year that Sinn Féin has narrowed its ideological space, both economically and socially,” he said.“It has flipped its policy on a number of social issues. In , the party would have been openly pro-le. In , they’ve gone the opposite direction.“I also battled internally for the last two years to make sure I could be part of the Oireachtas team on an equal basis, but because I had a dference of opinion on the issue of abortion that just wasn’t allowed. I wasn’t given the chance to equally participate in the organisation.“For example, the leadership of Sinn Féin, Michelle O’Neill and Mary Lou, went to London recently and asked Westminster to legislate on three separate areas for the North of Ireland – that’s unheard of in republican terms. For  years republicans have tried to stop them legislating on Ireland.”He continued: “The party is also caught in a way in that it wants to reach middle-Ireland more, maybe looking at winning seats in leafy liberal Dublinit can, reaching out to the media too, but there is a big danger that it will lose its grassroots base. I think the Presidential campaign was an example of where the grassroots became so disempowered that they didn’t come out for the organisation.”Mr Tóibín insists that Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Fianna Fáil, and Labour have positioned themselves on the same space, and that his party hopes to attract disillusioned members. Asked about his party’s policies, beyond being pro-le, Mr Tóibín said: “We are for the unity of the Irish people North and South and we will be reaching out the hand of friendship to people from a Protestant background, people who wouldn’t have been able to vote for Sinn Féin in the past, for many reasons. “We’ll also be reaching out to people who believe that the Tories have made such balderdash of Brexit, and have had their rights to self-determination taken away with regards to remaining in the EU. For us, economic justice issues are very important. Right now we have people in the North who are in food poverty, housing poverty, health poverty and yet we have stalemate at Stormont.”He contined: “We need the governments to institute joint authority in the North. We also need to make sure that there is serious work done on the All-Ireland economy. It was sold to us as part of the Good Friday Agreement, but it had fallen off the agenda for many political parties. It will be one of the greatest tools toameliorate the effects of Brexit. “Another point, and I think, Sinn Féin have been remiss on this, we want an independence referendum, but we can start to deconstruct the border in the meantime. “The border is made up of thousands of dferent bricks, which stand for a practical experience in someone’s le. It could be a cross-border ambulance service, a cross-border health service, cross-border education, or corporation tax – a cross-border soccer team. Every time we fix those issues, we create convergence North and South, we improve the delivery of services and the quality of le for people, and the height of the border starts to reduce in height.”Mr Tóibín has said his party hopes to stand between  to  candidates across Ireland, and has already attracted nine elected councillors. Asked about the number of candidates standing in Belfast, Mr Tóibín said: “We won’t get into the micro details just yet. Hundreds of people are joining us on a weekly basis. New cumainn are being set up around the country, and we have new cumainn that will be set up in Belfast. “We want to make sure that we are an activist based grassroots organisation. If we get that infrastructure set up around the six counties then we hope to be selecting candidates by early February in places we believe we can win seats.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-24-at-16.25.07.png","title":"womens place in national debate","story":"LAST year was a year to remember for women’s rights. ‘Me Too’ was a phrase heard around the globe as artists in many spheres made sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination visible. It was a lesson that went way beyond the arts.The referendum on the th Amendment to the Irish constitution made the experience of women visible in multiple ways. It was not merely about the personal heartbreak of inidual women, it was also about systemic oppression of Irish women and children, and reached into the earth of Tuam, County Galway, where babies’ bodies had been buried in an unconsecrated septic tank by nuns and priests.It was the year that celebrated  years of some women’s franchise and paid homage to suffragettes and the first woman MP, Constance Markievitz.With the election of Clare Bailey as leader of the Green Party we now have women leaders of four of the six mainparties. In many ways it all seemed seminal. That women’s agendas could no longer be ignored. However, we are all too aware of its limitations too. The words ‘The North is Next’ regarding access to full choices in pregnancy clearly require the addition of ‘at some point’.Women’s participation in politics, while improving, remains poor. In the forthcoming council election watch how many women are standing in winnable seats and watch which parties do what. A fair enough group photo of gender balance announcing candidates is often at quite a distance from the elected officials’ photograph afterwards.Just as in , contemporary strides on women’s rights need to be carefully looked after in the years to come. While Cumann na mBan and feminism were integral to the operation of the First Dáil and the appropriation of public le during the Tan War, what we witnessed afterwards was an assault on women’s rights, from the constitution to the maternity ward afterwards. In the north the oppression of women went hand in glove with the oppression of the nationalist population in the right wing statelet.Right now, there is a conversation happening about what a new Ireland might look like. The conversation focuses on constitutional rights, economic interests and demographics. Campaigns feed into it with social and cultural rights featuring intermittently.What we have failed to do is insert the vibrant and rich debate last year on women’s rights into this national debate in the meaningful way. For instance, women who cannot be equal participants in our society because their citizenship and culture are denied to them are doubly oppressed as women are unequal participants in so many avenues of le.Just as in - when Irish suffragettes gave expression to their fight for self-determination being linked to their country’s fight for self-determination, we need to seek out space and language for a modern Irish women’s vision. Indeed, in those years Irish suffragettes’ colours were not purple white and green – they were orange, white and green. It was a bold statement of intent: that women would not be written out of the Proclamation or a new Ireland.That new Ireland was never realised with the imposition of partition. Specic attention must now be paid to women’s participation, needs and aspirations as we build our new vision for a transformed Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"dup under pressure from within to get brexit deal to end border poll calls report","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In the   academic year , applications were made for the , available places at our  selective grammars.NI Transfer Tests:  Grammar Schools’ intake and grade informationThis is out of a total of , pupils who obtained Year  places at Northern Irelands  post-primary schools in September .Today the Belfastcan reveal what grades or scores it took to get into each of our selective grammars last year.This exclusive data was obtained over several months by sending Freedom of Information Act requests to each of the selective grammars.Currently there are no official figures provided by the Department of Education, because both the Post Primary Transfer Consortiums GL assessment and the Association of Quality EducationsCommon Entrance Assessment are unofficial tests.Our data for tests sat in the   academic year reveal:Five schools which use the AQE system did not accept a score below  in September .Five schools which use the GL system did not accept a grade below an A in September . schools accepted AQE scores, while  accepted GL scores, and seven took either.Lagan College, which is partially selective, was the most popular first choice by far, with  applications for  places.Friends School Lisburn was one of the toughest schools to get into last September - the lowest score it accepted was  .Three of the  selective grammar schools were not oversubscribed.The AQE and GL tests received a total number of , entries in the   academic year - , sat the AQEs and , sat the GL tests. An unknown number of pupils sat both tests.There are  post-primary schools in Northern Ireland, of which  are grammars that use academic selection for all or some of their Year  intake.Leaders in the AQE and GL organisations told the Belfastthat their entry rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade following the abolition of the old Department of Education-administered -plus by former Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in .AQE chief executive Stephen Connolly said the number of entrants to the test is continuing to rise, with , pupils registered for the  AQE tests, a rise of almost % on  .Mr Connolly said he can only speculate on the increase, but said he believed it may partly follow a decision by former Education Minister Peter Weir to allow primary schools to prepare pupils to sit transfer tests. That reversed a ruling by his predecessor John ODowd, which saw schools receive warning letters from the department over preparing pupils for tests within school hours.\"That reflects a number of things, that is the steadily increasing primary school age population, also a backwash from the former minister taking the shackles off primary schools and allowing them to openly prepare pupils for transfer tests, and also word of mouth from parent to parent,\" he said. There was also an increase in the number of pupils who sat the PPTCs GL test, from , in the   academic year to , in  .Carol McCann from the PPTC said parents remained very supportive of the tests.\"More than  schools use the GL test and it is used by a iety of types of school, including grammar and bilateral,\" she said.\"A number of PPTC schools also register pupils for the AQE test. Regarding the increase in the number of pupils sitting the test in  for entry to post-primary in , it is most likely as a result of a rising primary school population in a number of areas.\"It is very evident that the transfer test continues to be supported by parents in Northern Ireland who believe in educational choice.\"Meanwhile, talks between the two transfer test providers to create a single system of assessment remain \"ongoing and positive\".The AQE and PPTC aim to have a common test in place by November . Mr Connolly said that talks are continuing but the end goal is very complex, and they want to ensure any new single system is robust, will have the confidence of parents, and is of an international standard.\"The two negotiating teams made a very good decision at the outset to keep it confidential to not raise expectation or increase pressures and making sure the goodwill between us in this dficult process is maintained,\" he said. \"Trying to put together a single system is very dficult.\"I think it is very important that both groups think it is a matter of principle there should be one system.\"That principle has been agreed, but getting there is tricky simply because of the complexity of the two systems. People need to have confidence in schools, but also in the testing system.\"It needs to be reliable, robust and meet international standards. It isnt just a race to cobble together any old compromise, we are engaging in careful negotiation.\" Results for both tests are due to be released to pupils this Saturday.How the figures are compiledUnder the Freedom of Information Actlegislation we asked the grammar schools in Northern Ireland which use academic selection to determine their Year  intake to provide the breakdown of the AQE GL grades scores achieved by the pupils they admitted in September .The data gives schools’ name, location, the highest grade score quintile band it accepted and the lowest grade score quintile band it accepted.Other information included is the number of first preference choices it received and total applications .Several schools have provided bands for the lowest and highest scores they accepted, as this is the method they used to select pupils. Some schools accept both AQE and GL scores.Not all schools use academic selection to determine their entire intake. Wallace High School in Lisburn admits around % of its Year  intake on test results Campbell College in Belfast admits %, while Lagan College in Belfast and Slemish College in Ballymena select % of their pupils using test scores. Some other schools also use additional criteria to separate students with the same score vying for the final places. Two voluntary grammar schools, Loreto College in Coleraine and St Patrick’s Grammar in Armagh, no longer use academic selection.Total pupil figures do not tally for a number of reasons, which can include pupils with a statement of special educational needs not being included in enrolment figures, and some pupils being accepted through special circumstances or on appeal.In some schools pupils were admitted without using academic selection and some schools were undersubscribed.When comparing schools, the size should be taken into account. For example Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor has an annual Year  intake of  pupils. Its principal Mr W E Thompson pointed out that the th pupil they accepted in September  scored  in the AQE test, but in the North Down area there are smaller selective grammars which accepted only  pupils.He has asked us to point out that the th pupil Glenlola accepted scored  in the AQE tests."},{"url":null,"title":"transfer test results dont miss belfast telegraphs year 8 school","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

both the United Kingdom and Ireland would have responsibilities to honour the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process,\" he said.\"So I think wed end up in a situation whereby the EU and Ireland

I would definitely describe that as sub-optimal.“When is the Government going to make its own announcement that under no circumstances it will allow the UK to leave without a deal so we can stop this slow and damaging haemorrhage ”Brexit Minister Chris Heaton-Harris replied: “It does beg the reply that why on earth is he not then backing the deal that delivers the certainty all of those businesses he named have asked for “I think he needs to look at the deal once again, to deliver the certainty that businesses across the UK require.”The developments came amid growing support in Labour ranks for a parliamentary bid by former minister Yvette Cooper to extend Article , which would keep the UK in the EU longer, unless a deal is reached by the end of February.Leading Brexiteers have attacked such initiatives, saying they would take control of events from the Government.In another sign of opposition to the Prime Minister’s stance,  ministers, including Cabinet members, have been meeting to discuss preventing a no-deal Brexit, according to the Daily .I think it would be betterit was a binary choiceSir Keir Starmer on a possible new Brexit referendumFacebookTwitterOne member of the ministerial group dubbed it the “hair-shirt club”, the newspaper reported.Unions have been warning of the impact on jobs of a no-deal Brexit and have been pressing for assurances about employment rights after the UK leaves the EU.Some have also argued in favour of a second referendum.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Nigel Farage On the issue of a new national poll on EU withdrawal, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said any referendum should have just two options.He told ITV’s Peston: “I think there should definitely be Remain.“And there should be a genuine Leave option.“I think it would be betterit was a binary choice.”Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage insisted Mrs May’s withdrawal plans should be opposed, eventhat risked a new referendum.He told ITV’s Peston: “Personally, my view at the moment is better to vote down this dreadful deal and take the risk of a second referendum.”Ms Cooper’s Article  bid, which has cross-party backing including from Conservative Nick Boles, is one of a number of amendments that could be voted on next Tuesdayselected by Commons Speaker John Bercow."},{"url":null,"title":"social media users are recounting their hilarious mistakes made on autopilot","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The resulting m scrum led to a succession of drives for the line and when the ball was recycled a loose pass missed its intended target, but Rory Campbell took the ball smartly on the bounce to score in the corner for an early Malone lead.After Paddy Wright missed a long-range penalty, Ballynahinch earned an excellent attacking position with a m line out following an excellent Ross Adair touch-finder. The line out was won, but Malone forced a crucial turnover and the chance went begging.Both sides continued to be careless in possession in a niggly match, which was low on quality.On  minutes a Malone breakdown penalty gave lsquoHinch a chance to drive for the line and as they progressed, Malone blatantly killed the ball and could count themselves lucky not to receive a yellow. Wright slotted the penalty to close the gap to two points.Following a Malone penalty miss, lsquoHinch botched their own line out allowing the home side to pile into the . Zack McCall was penalised for offside as Malone looked to sweep the ball wide and was given a yellow card. Malone then scored from a tap penalty to take a - half-time lead.The second half followed a similar pattern to the first with Ballynahinch going further behind to another try from the prolic Campbell after another lsquoHinch mistake on their own line out.Ross Adair reduced the arrears on  minutes with a converted try to put lsquoHinch in bonus point territory and the away side belatedly roused themselves to pile the pressure on Malone during the final ten minutes.However, the home defence held and lsquoHinch had to settle for a point, earned largely through the woes of the Malone place kicker, who failed to land any of his attempts on goal.A disappointing start to  for the locals and they will need to be more accurate this week as Ballymena come to Ballymacarn Park.Malone Ballynahinch AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygowan’s Emma hoping to make waves at Abu Dhabi Special Olympics  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN swimmer is hoping to make a big splash when she goes to the Middle East in March.Twenty three year-old Emma Carlisle will be going for gold when she swims for Ireland at the  Special Olympics World Summer Games in Abu Dhabi.Emma is one of seven athletes from Co Down included in the -strong Team Ireland squad for the Games which take place over March -.Newry is well represented with four athletes selected.

He defeated the Irish at Downpatrick and gave these families who followed him large estates.Their strongholds were no match, however, for the energy and enthusiasm of the locals and eventually it was easier for them to adopt Irish manners and dress and conform to the customs of Down.According to Irish custom, land didnrsquot belong to the king mdash it belonged to the people and usually went to the strongest chieftain. The residents are reported to have disliked taxes, not much change there down the centuries.McBride dedicates a chapter to the United Irishman mdash immortalised as lsquoThe Man From God Knows Wherersquo mdash who was hanged outside Downpatrick Gaol .And where would society beit wasnrsquot for the humble rubber tyre, whose inventor, John Boyd Dunlop, worked for several years in his brotherrsquos veterinary practice in Downpatrick.Of course no book on the history of Co Down would be complete without a chapter on some of our ghosts and ghouls.McBride has included some of the most interesting. The book tells the story of Noel Killen, originally from Loughinisland, who rode his bike passed the old derelict Ballydugan Flour Mill, near Downpatrick, when he was a young lad and dreamt of restoring it.His dream came true. By virtue of his hard work he recaptured the millrsquos former glory and turned it into an award-winning wedding venue, complete with three happy ghosts who attend weddings and bring luck.Therersquos a Presbyterian minister who loiters around the basement and sometimes appears on the ground floor in the corner near the fire. Then there is Bobby, who danders across the first floor. He can be unpredictable as he is often said to slam the occasional door.Then there is the young girl dressed in sackcloth who loves to dance. She can sometimes be seen to be dancing to the music provided at the wedding breakfast.The book also notes the fable of Maggie who leapt across a deep chasm between the clfs near Newcastle in a bid to outrun a group of soldiers while carrying a basket of stolen birdrsquos eggs.Not an egg was broken in her successful attempt to clear the clf and she lived to see a ripe old age.

Local people have sought a meeting with Department of Health officials on this matter and I will be happy to pursue and facilitate this.ldquoThere is a need for such a crucially important service for parents and indeed the wider family circle to be delivered regionally.Three weeks ago, local politicians called on the Permanent Secretary to reduce the ldquoalready enormous burden from parents suffering from bereavement and come up with a better solution than sending babies to Liverpool.Politicians said they were not averse to an all island service, insisting the reinstatement of the Belfast-based paediatric pathologist who retied is also vitally important moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New £217k play park welcome boost for Meadowlands estate  ","story":"MEADOWLANDS estate in Downpatrick is at last to get a new play park costing pound,.Work on the park should start within weeks and be ready by the end of March.A proposal to proceed with the scheme was approved by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee on Monday night.The new park is a joint project with the council and Downpatrick Neighbourhood Renewal with % funding from the Department of the Communities.The council will be responsible for managing its construction and its maintenance.The new park is to be located in front of Drumcloon Walk and adjacent to the Quoile Crescent housing development.According to the Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service statistics, Meadowlands is ranked th out of  areas of high health deprivation.The need for the park has also been supported by statistics from the Northern Ireland Research and Information Agency which show that there are  children under the age of  living in the Quoile Ward area who could avail of the park.It is also hoped that the park will help with the regeneration of the area and improve its overall look.The siting of the park was moved after some local concern was expressed that it would too close to pensionersrsquo homes in Drumcloon Park.Meadowlands Community Association, which was formed with help from local councillor Cadogan Enright, last week welcomed the move and the fact that the council listened to its representations.At Mondayrsquos meeting, Cllr Billy Walker proposed that the committee agree to go ahead with the park.He said: ldquoI really welcome this play park, as will the residents, he said. ldquoBeing the last chairman of the old district council, I know that a park for Meadowlands was a legacy issue.ldquoThere is real need for this as Meadowlands is one of the most deprived areas in the Downpatrick DEA and itrsquos to good see that that hard work is at last bearing fruit.Cllr Cadogan, who seconded the proposal, added: ldquoI am delighted that this play park can go ahead as I have been working with the residents for years and itrsquos at last getting over the line..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New amenity centre set for spring opening  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new ultra-modern civic amenity centre could open as early as the spring, council officials have confirmed.The new facility at Flying Horse Road will replace the existing centre at nearby Cloonagh Road, which continues to struggle with the increasing demands being placed upon it.Over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, the centre was forced to close early due to the volume of waste.The early closure annoyed many ratepayers with council officials confident the new centre mdash which is signicantly larger mdash will be able to handle more recyclable material.Over recent years, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has invested signicant sums building new civic amenity sites in Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with the Flying Horse Road facility set to be one of the most modern of its kind.Confirmation that the new Downpatrick centre could open as early as the spring will be given at this eveningrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.There was a delay in building the new facility as a suitable site could not be identied and when work did eventually get underway, progress was temporarily halted as equipment belonging to contractors was targeted by vandals.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed news then the new centre could open for business as early as the spring.The local authorityrsquos lease of the Cloonagh Road facility has been extended until the end of March but it has been recognised for some time that this facility has passed its sell-by-date.Cllr Curran said it was important Downpatrick had a recycling centre which was fit-for-purpose and could meet the needs of ratepayers across a wide area.He said the facility was not solely used by people in the town.

Credit is also due to the coaches and senior members of the club for their part in the planning of operations.This weekendItrsquos NI and Ulster Intermediate and Masters Championships races in Barnettrsquos Park on Saturday, beginning at pm.Please, ladies in particular, note the revised schedule as due to the numbers involved the intermediate ladiesrsquo race will be a separate race at pm, and will not be combined with theMasters Women, as originally planned.See you there..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Reception celebrates 45 years’ service  ","story":"THE contribution of the provincersquos longest serving councillor to the district and its people was recognised at a civic reception in his honour last weekend.Dermot Curran has served the people of the district for an incredible  years and his letime of public service recognised by Newry, Mourne and Down Council at a celebratory event at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch.Joined by his we Karen, family friends, former and current council colleagues and Northern Ireland Local Government representatives, Cllr Curran was overwhelmed by the good wishes of around  people who attended the event.Also in attendance were representatives from regional and national governments and non-governmental organisations who joined together to celebrate a remarkable achievement.Tributes were paid by current council chairman Mark Murnin, local authority chief executive Liam Hannaway and Northern Ireland Local Government Associationvice-president Fred Donnelly.The council presented him with a beautul James G Miles painting of Ballyhornan beach where he revealed he played as a boy, while Cllr Curranrsquos SDLP colleagues presented him with a portrait oh himself by Killyleagh artist Leo Casement.Cllr Murnin said his council colleague has been dedicated to public service since his first election in , serving two terms as Down Council chairman and then being elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council in .ldquoOur council has been fortunate to have many hard working and exemplary councillors who strive to make this district a better place to live and work in, he continued. ldquoNo one demonstrates this more clearly than Dermot and during his first term as council chairman, he had the vision to work with councils across Ireland to develop relationships and encourage co-operative projects.ldquoBut we are not the only body to recognise the contribution that Dermot has made to our district.

INPT-.Brooklyn is just seven years old but has thrown his little heart and soul into helping his eight-year-old buddyElisei.Little Brooklyn appears to have a knack for signing and helps his mate in an unobtrusive and unassuming manner.It’s been a long and sometimes challenging road since little Elisei first joined the nursery school at Hart Memorial, shy and unable to communicate. Due to a genetic condition, little Elisei is profoundly deaf.His Special Education Needs assistant Tracey Black went beyond the call of duty and, in her own time, learned sign language to help communicate with the little boy. Hart Memorial Primary School pupil, Elisei Cionca performs a Romanian dancewatched by classroom assistant,Tracey Black and his friend, Brooklyn Bruce. INPR-.Hart Memorial Principal Julie Shipley said: “Tracey sourced, when Elisei first came into nursery, a course to get to Stage One BSL. She did that of her own volition.“She developed that and all the way along with her education, taught others including the children in the class.Now his current teacherZoe Annett is also able to sign and Elisei has become totally involved in all class activities. And Elisei’s Romanian parents have learned sign language along with their son.Tracey Black, classroom assistant, and Elisei Cionca. INPT-.Elisei has other adult members of the family who are deaf and others who are hearing.“The way they had been communicating prior to this was ‘made-up’ gestures,” said Julie Shipley.“Now when we get one of the deaf members of the family for a parents meeting, we can get a Sign Language interpreter whereas before what we were doing was getting a Romanian interpreter who was hearing and using these made up gestures which weren’t any sign language, let along Romanian sign language.”Republican prisoner says lack of Irish classes ‘breaches Good Friday Agreement’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"She explained the teachers Elisei has had over the years have been tremendously supportive.

The two boys have always been good friends.Brooklyn seems to have a special talent for picking up sign language and has used this to support Elisei throughout school, in and out of the classroom. Mrs Black, Elisei’s SEN assistant, says that she never has to worry about Elisei when she’s not there as she knows Brooklyn will keep him right!Ms Shipley said: “Elisei loves to organise people! “If he sees one of his classmates misbehaving, he’s over to them, signing away and wagging a finger, to tell them what they should be doing. Sign Of The Times...Elisei Cionca, left, and his friend, Brooklyn Bruce. INPT-.“When he’s had his say, he’ll stand there with his hands on his hips, shaking his head and rolling his eyes! “We think he’s completing his apprenticeship to be a teacher himself at sometime in the future.“Elisei looks forward to holidays when the family is going to Romania. “Often his excitement overcomes him and he’s up at the front of the classroom doing Romanian traditional dancing!“Elisei is interested in everything that’s going on in and out of the classroom and likes to share his opinion on everything too! “Ms Black, his SEN assistant, sometimes has to explain the fine line between being curious and being nosey!“He is the most positive, fun-loving enthusiastic pupil you could hope to meet!“He is fully involved in school le and, whenever his class has a special event e.g. a special assembly for parents and pupils, a performance at the carol service, all the pupils include a signing element into the content.”Indeed at Christmas just past, his class performed ‘We Wish You A Merry Christmas’ using sign language and the whole congregation loved it.Miss Shipley said the school is very proud of Elisei and Brooklyn and all the children who have learned to sign as well as Ms Black and Mrs Annett.

However she said they would still have activists in the area on Saturday to counter any “media stunt” that Sinn Fein might attempt.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

INPT-.Brooklyn is just seven years old but has thrown his little heart and soul into helping his eight-year-old buddyElisei.Little Brooklyn appears to have a knack for signing and helps his mate in an unobtrusive and unassuming manner.It’s been a long and sometimes challenging road since little Elisei first joined the nursery school at Hart Memorial, shy and unable to communicate. Due to a genetic condition, little Elisei is profoundly deaf.His Special Education Needs assistant Tracey Black went beyond the call of duty and, in her own time, learned sign language to help communicate with the little boy. Hart Memorial Primary School pupil, Elisei Cionca performs a Romanian dancewatched by classroom assistant,Tracey Black and his friend, Brooklyn Bruce. INPR-.Hart Memorial Principal Julie Shipley said: “Tracey sourced, when Elisei first came into nursery, a course to get to Stage One BSL. She did that of her own volition.“She developed that and all the way along with her education, taught others including the children in the class.Now his current teacherZoe Annett is also able to sign and Elisei has become totally involved in all class activities. And Elisei’s Romanian parents have learned sign language along with their son.Tracey Black, classroom assistant, and Elisei Cionca. INPT-.Elisei has other adult members of the family who are deaf and others who are hearing.“The way they had been communicating prior to this was ‘made-up’ gestures,” said Julie Shipley.“Now when we get one of the deaf members of the family for a parents meeting, we can get a Sign Language interpreter whereas before what we were doing was getting a Romanian interpreter who was hearing and using these made up gestures which weren’t any sign language, let along Romanian sign language.”Minister Ken Elliott who was ‘second only to Paisley as an evangelist’ dies Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"She explained the teachers Elisei has had over the years have been tremendously supportive.

The two boys have always been good friends.Brooklyn seems to have a special talent for picking up sign language and has used this to support Elisei throughout school, in and out of the classroom. Mrs Black, Elisei’s SEN assistant, says that she never has to worry about Elisei when she’s not there as she knows Brooklyn will keep him right!Ms Shipley said: “Elisei loves to organise people! “If he sees one of his classmates misbehaving, he’s over to them, signing away and wagging a finger, to tell them what they should be doing. Sign Of The Times...Elisei Cionca, left, and his friend, Brooklyn Bruce. INPT-.“When he’s had his say, he’ll stand there with his hands on his hips, shaking his head and rolling his eyes! “We think he’s completing his apprenticeship to be a teacher himself at sometime in the future.“Elisei looks forward to holidays when the family is going to Romania. “Often his excitement overcomes him and he’s up at the front of the classroom doing Romanian traditional dancing!“Elisei is interested in everything that’s going on in and out of the classroom and likes to share his opinion on everything too! “Ms Black, his SEN assistant, sometimes has to explain the fine line between being curious and being nosey!“He is the most positive, fun-loving enthusiastic pupil you could hope to meet!“He is fully involved in school le and, whenever his class has a special event e.g. a special assembly for parents and pupils, a performance at the carol service, all the pupils include a signing element into the content.”Indeed at Christmas just past, his class performed ‘We Wish You A Merry Christmas’ using sign language and the whole congregation loved it.Miss Shipley said the school is very proud of Elisei and Brooklyn and all the children who have learned to sign as well as Ms Black and Mrs Annett.

I really enjoy it and it allows me to work from home.”Courses cost from £ and include tea coffee and scones. Mary-Anne delivers savoury cookery classes as well but explained that baking is far and away the most popular.“I wasn’t actually trained as a pastry chef but there has been such a resurgence in the popularity of baking. That is where the demand is. I would love to do more cookery classes where people can learn to do savoury foods too, however the majority of bookings are for those sweet treats we all love. I like to combine traditional recipes and new flavours. Local, seasonal and organic ingredients are key.”Each course can accommodate - people and are booked out weeks in advance. All recipes andequipment are provided and you get to take home what you make.“My style is informal, it’s all about having fun. I do hands-on and demonstration classes and cater for all levels from complete beginners to more experienced cooks. The aim is to get stuck in.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

It’s still lovingly referred to as the Swiss watch stalwart’s sister brand.From there, following the Second World War, he decided now was the time to expand and give the brand an identity of its own.The primary dference between the brands back then, was that Rolex watches carried in-house movements, and that Tudor would offer familiar watch styles, such as the Oyster and Submariner, at a more affordable cost, while its big brother would guarantee the technical, aesthetic and al characteristics, along with distribution and after sales service.But the brand back then, and the company now, has changed radically. Just a few years ago, it tore up the rulebook on its traditional line – moving away from historically similar watches to Rolex, and a few changes from its classical lines, towards a tight range of watches, bringing in the old and the new.The core model is the Black Bay. A millimetre larger than the Rolex Submariner, it’s a slightly chunkier affair, without treading into the excessive sizes of some other brand’s modern timepieces. It also offers a new ‘’ –  a smaller mm watch, which fits right in as a cheaper alternative to the Submariner, a Black Bay Chronograph and the Pelagos – a larger, more modern affair made out of titanium.The brand also comes in at a time when Rolex prices have shot up, considerably. Many of the most desirable models in the Rolex line have a waiting list – with second-hand prices outpacing the new book price.Tudor itself has also embraced this burgeoning demand, releasing its own GMT watch – with so-called ‘Pepsi’ blue and red bezel. Currently, Rolex’s own model – aside from the sizeable price dference – will mean joining a waiting list. A WEEK ON THE WRIST Tudor Heritage Black Bay Sitting as Tudor’s poster-boy or flagship in its range, the Black Bay is a e watch which melds the styling and inspiration of, possibly the most recognisable watch in the world, the Rolex Submariner, with a larger case, while adding patina on the hands and markers.There’s no crown-guard, ala Rolex. This time, it’s a larger, screw-down, with an etched Tudor rose – formerly the brand’s logo.Overall, the Black Bay’s case is brushed, including the caseback, with the finish smoothly transitioning into a polish around the sides and crown.The sapphire crystal glass is slightly domed, sitting around a millimetre off the face off the watch. Around the edge, the bezel is a solid, thick and satisfyingly sold -click version, with red triangle and lume dot.This version is on a steel bracelet, but is also available on a leather or fabric band, along with red dial and blue – the latter without the patina on the markers and hands.The bracelet is a stand-out characteristic of the piece, certainly in terms of build quality. The three-piece links have a lug width of mm, tapering to around mm. It’s brushed, but polished and riveted along the side. On the clasp, there’s a double-locking system, with a thoughtful inclusion of the Tudor shield logo into the mechanism, along with three points of micro-adjustment.This watch, available from jeweller Lunn’s, spent several days on my wrist – from the office, to out-and-about and around the house. It’s a comfortable piece to wear – balanced between a bit more heft than its more expensive sibling, but never straying into the realm of gaudy or garish.After a few hours, it felt very much like one of my own. I did miss the date, however, but those after additional complications or ality could look to the chronograph version, or the larger Pelagos.The Black Bay is a well-balanced piece – easily sitting at the centre of a Venn diagram between casual and formal.The brand itself is firing everything at the new range, with endorsements from David Beckham and Lady Gaga, aimed at a younger generation with disposable income to spare. While that may not appeal or speak to the horological purists, with the in-house movement, attention to detail, provenance and mixture of the traditional and modern, it’s likely to build a fresh reputation as a ‘watch fan’ timepiece, and for those who have no issue explaining to those admiring the chunk of steel on their wrists, that it isn’t a Rolex.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/prog_1.jpg","title":"leaders in business darina armstrong","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Darina Armstrong’s career within the Progressive Building Society began at a young age, working her way up to leading the organisation since  – almost  years after first starting with the society.“I absolutely love everything about the business. I love the mutual ethos, and that we are fundamentally there to help the community,” she told Ulster Business.“We have to make a , but fundamentally we are there for the good of society. I passionately believe that home ownership is a good thing. And I passionately believe that savings are a good thing, and that’s what our business has been doing for more than  years.”According to its latest full-year figures, ending in December , Progressive posted pre-tax profit of £.m.In the last year, it helped more than , people buy their home and almost  to build a new home, with overall new mortgage lending of around £m.It’s weathered some of the most dficult years in the residential property market here, with Northern Ireland prices plummeting in the wake of the recession in .“We are battling our way through that – the housing market hasn’t fully recovered through it. The number of new developments probably aren’t servicing the needs of the demand. We still have an issue out there.“Slow, and modest growth is happening at the minute. But that’s good, and that’s sustainable. Affordability is very good in Northern Ireland and the economic factors, even with Brexit, are good.”Progressive now has  branches and more than  staff spread throughout Northern Ireland.For Darina, it’s about working hand-in-hand with the customer, and ensuring everyone in the team in the same mindset.“For me, it has to be doing right by the customer. Once your staff are fully on that journey too, they know they are doing the right thing,” Darina says. “They aren’t forced into sales targets – they want to get the right product fro the person, and making it as easy as they possibly can.“In part, to hand hold. There are some cases where deadlines don’t happen, things don’t go according to plans – for example, in a housing chain, someone can drop out. It’s about being there, and being able to help.“There is still a demand for people to buy houses – that hasn’t changed at all.”Darina took over at the helm in , while the property market in Northern Ireland, and throughout the UK, was still going through tough times. But she believes it has normalised since then.“Things are picking up,” she says. “We have the experience here to keep going in a direction that suits the demographic that we serve.“We are here for the long-term, and factor that in. Ultimately, it has to be right for the consumer.“It’s also about the whole of Northern Ireland. It’s not just Belfast-centric, and we have to extend our reach. There’s good activity in dferent parts of Northern Ireland, and that’s where our roots are.”And after more than  years with the organisation, Darina says she has no plans to jump ship to another financial business.“I am totally bought in to the mutual ethos. For me, it’s all about the customer. I would struggle where decisions would be made for shareholder , or short-termism.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
